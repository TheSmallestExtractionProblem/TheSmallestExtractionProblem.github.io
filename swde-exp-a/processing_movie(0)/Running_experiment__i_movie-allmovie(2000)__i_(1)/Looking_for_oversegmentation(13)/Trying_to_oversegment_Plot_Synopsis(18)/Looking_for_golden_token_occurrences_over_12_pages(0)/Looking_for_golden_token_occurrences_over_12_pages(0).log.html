Wong Fei Hong (Chan) is a young master of the martial art of "drunken boxing" in which fighters use alcohol to blind themselves to pain and release the angry brawler within; with the right amount of drinks under his belt Hong can become a furious one-man army. Hong accompanies his father (Ti Lung) on a voyage to China where they purchase a precious supply of ginseng. When Hong discovers thugs stealing from their luggage he leaps into action to get their belongings back. Instead he winds up with a box of valuable Chinese artifacts which criminals are hoping to smuggle to England at a tremendous profit. Hong sets out to fight the gangsters and give the artifacts back to their rightful owners but while his stepmother (Anita Mui) encourages him to use his drunken boxing skills his father feels his boozy antics bring shame to the family. Jackie Chan brought some of his most elaborate stunt work to Drunken Master 2 including a remarkable fight on a bed of hot coals; Chan also directed part of the film after Lau Kar Leung was fired after a number of disagreements with his star.

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart his son is a junkie and his health is failing which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however the longer he plays the role of the gangster the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny Lefty's boss and Bruno Kirby as Nicky one of Sonny's henchmen.

Adapted by Karl Tunberg and a raft of uncredited writers including Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson the film once more recounts the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who lives in Judea with his family during the time that Jesus Christ was becoming known for his "radical" teachings. Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) is now an ambitious Roman tribune; when Ben-Hur refuses to help Messala round up local dissidents on behalf of the emperor Messala pounces on the first opportunity to exact revenge on his onetime friend. Tried on a trumped-up charge of attempting to kill the provincial governor (whose head was accidentally hit by a falling tile) Ben-Hur is condemned to the Roman galleys while his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) are imprisoned. But during a sea battle Ben-Hur saves the life of commander Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who in gratitude adopts Ben-Hur as his son and gives him full control over his stable of racing horses. Ben-Hur never gives up trying to find his family or exact revenge on Messala. At crucial junctures in his life he also crosses the path of Jesus and each time he benefits from it. The highlight of the film's 212 minutes is its now-legendary chariot race staged largely by stunt expert Yakima Canutt.

The film centers on the relationship of the beautiful and imperious Eliane (Catherine Deneuve) a French rubber-plantation owner and Camille (Linh Dan Pham) her adopted Indochinese daughter. The mother and daughter are very close until a diffident naval officer Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) enters their lives. Eliane is in love with him but Jean-Baptiste and Camille become attracted to each other and fall in love. Thinking that she is doing Camille a favor Eliane arranges to have Jean-Baptiste transferred to the far-away Tonkin Islands. But Camille flees the plantation to go to the man she loves. As she travels the country she gains a greater knowledge and respect for the people of her homeland. When the government tears her from Jean-Baptiste and their infant child and arrests her for crimes against the state she becomes politicized and becomes a supporter of the communists in the country's civil war.
