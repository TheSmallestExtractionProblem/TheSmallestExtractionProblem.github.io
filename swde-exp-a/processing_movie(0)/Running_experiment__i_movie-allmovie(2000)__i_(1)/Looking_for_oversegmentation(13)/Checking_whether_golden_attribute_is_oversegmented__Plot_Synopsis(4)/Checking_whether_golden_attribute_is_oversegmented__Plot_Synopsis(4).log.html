Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1997</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0008</DIV><DIV class="tc">elle de Jour dramatizes the collision between depravity and elegance one of the favorite themes of director Luis Buñuel. Catherine Deneuve stars as a wealthy but bored newlywed eager to taste life to the fullest. She seemingly gets her wish early in the film when she is kidnapped tied to a tree and gang-raped. It turns out that this is only a daydream but her subsequent visits to a neighboring brothel where she offers her services certainly seem to be real. This illusion/reality dichotomy extends to the final scenes in which we are offered two possible endings. Thanks to a question of copyright and ownership Belle de Jour disappeared from view shortly after its 1967 release not even resurfacing on videotape. When it was reissued theatrically in 1994 many critics placed the perplexing but mesmerizing film on their lists of that year's best films.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1967</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0013</DIV><DIV class="tc">In the classic play by Tennessee Williams brought to the screen by Elia Kazan faded Southern belle Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) comes to visit her pregnant sister Stella (Kim Hunter) in a seedy section of New Orleans. Stella's boorish husband Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) not only regards Blanche's aristocratic affectations as a royal pain but also thinks she's holding out on inheritance money that rightfully belongs to Stella. On the fringes of sanity Blanche is trying to forget her checkered past and start life anew. Attracted to Stanley's friend Mitch (Karl Malden) she glosses over the less savory incidents in her past but she soon discovers that she cannot outrun that past and the stage is set for her final brutal confrontation with her brother-in-law. Brando Hunter and Malden had all starred in the original Broadway version of Streetcar although the original Blanche had been Jessica Tandy. Brando lost out to Humphrey Bogart for the 1951 Best Actor Oscar but Leigh Hunter and Malden all won Oscars.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1951</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0015</DIV><DIV class="tc">Director Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was touted at the time of its release (successfully if the box-office receipts are any indication) as something of a "youth trip" movie. This is because Zeffirelli broke the long-standing tradition of casting over-aged sometimes grey-haired players in the title roles. Seventeen-year-old Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey as Juliet. The youthfulness and inexperience of the leading players works beautifully in the more passionate sequences (some of these breaking further ground by being played in the nude). Among the younger players are Michael York as Tybalt and John McEnery as Mercutio. The duel between Romeo and Tybalt starts out as a harmless frat-boy exchange of insults then escalates into tragedy before any of the participants are fully aware of what has happened. Photographed by Pasqualino DeSantis on various locations in Italy Romeo and Juliet was one of the most profitable film adaptations of Shakespeare ever produced. Its most lasting legacy is its popular main theme music composed by Nino Rota.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1968</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0017</DIV><DIV class="tc">While this original movie version of Lorraine Hansberry's award-winning play may have dated somewhat it was groundbreaking when first released in 1961 and a wealth of future plays films and TV productions have taken their lead from this socially conscious drama about a struggling African-American family. Lena Younger (Claudia McNeil) is a strong proud woman who has raised a family in a crowded apartment on the South Side of Chicago. Her son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier) works as a chauffeur; intelligent and ambitious but impulsive and often angry he desperately wants to get ahead in a world that offers him few opportunities. His wife Ruth (Ruby Dee) takes in laundry to help make ends meet and watches over their son. Younger daughter Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a college student who wants to become a doctor and often speaks of searching for her cultural identity. On the death of her husband Lena becomes the beneficiary of a $10000 life insurance payment and suddenly the family is in conflict over how the money should be spent. Lena wants to use the money for a down payment on a house. Beneatha is hoping that Lena will help her pay for medical school. And Walter Lee wants to go into business with friends who plan to open a liquor store which he's convinced will be a sure money maker. The cast nearly all reprising their roles from the original Broadway production offers a collection of superb performances; also keep an eye peeled for a young Louis Gossett Jr. as George Murchison. While Daniel Petrie's direction never takes A Raisin in the Sun very far from its roots as a stage play it captures the power and tension of a strong ensemble cast working with an intelligent and moving script.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1961</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0019</DIV><DIV class="tc">Martin Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability (and desire) to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act the film flashes back to 1940s New York when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob however will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) but success does nothing to exorcise his demons even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey and disastrously gaining weight Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom however Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: "I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody." Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations it underperformed at the box office as audiences increasingly turned away from "difficult" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar as did the film's editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1980</DIV></DIV>

Among the various stars aspirants hangers-on observers and media folk are politically ambitious country icon Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) and his fragile star protegée Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley); Tom (Keith Carradine) a self-absorbed rock star who woos lonely married gospel singer Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin); Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles) a talentless waitress painfully humiliated at her first singing gig; Albuquerque (Barbara Harris) a runaway wife with dreams of stardom; nightclub owner Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley) who reminisces about "those Kennedy boys"; single-minded groupie L.A. Joan (Shelley Duvall); vapid BBC commentator Opal (Geraldine Chaplin); and campaign guru John Triplette (Michael Murphy) who is trying to organize a concert rally for the unseen but always heard populist presidential candidate-cum-demagogue Hal Phillip Walker. Everything comes to a head during a climactic concert at Nashville's replica of the Parthenon temple as the entertainment-hungry audience is momentarily woken out of its stupor by unexpected violence only to be lulled into a restorative sing-along to "It Don't Worry Me."</DIV><DIV class="tc">1975</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0024</DIV><DIV class="tc">ased on a James Leo Herlihy novel British director John Schlesinger's first American film dramatized the small hopes dashed dreams and unlikely friendship of two late '60s lost souls. Dreaming of an easy life as a fantasy cowboy stud cheerful Texas rube Joe Buck (Jon Voight) heads to New York City to be a gigolo but he quickly discovers that hustling isn't what he thought it would be after he winds up paying his first trick (Sylvia Miles). He gets swindled by gimpy tubercular grifter Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) but when Joe falls in the direst of straits Ratso takes Joe into his condemned apartment so that they can help each other survive. Things start to look up when Joe finally lands his first legit female customer (Brenda Vaccaro) at a Warhol-esque party; Ratso's health however fails. Joe turns a final trick to get the money for one selfless goal: taking Ratso out of New York to his dream life in Miami. One of the first major studio films given the newly minted X rating for its then-frank portrayal of New York decadence Midnight Cowboy was critically praised for Schlesinger's insight into American lives with the intercut mosaic of Joe's memories and Ratso's dreams lending their characters and actions greater psychological complexity. While they may have been drawn by the seamy content (tame by current standards) the young late '60s audience responded to Joe's and Ratso's confusion amidst turbulent times and to the connection they make with each other despite their alienation from the surrounding culture. Midnight Cowboy became one of the major financial and artistic hits of 1969 winning Oscars for Best Picture (the first for an X-rated film) Best Director and former blacklistee Waldo Salt's screenplay. Though the one-two punch of Midnight Cowboy and The Graduate (1967) proved Hoffman's range and Voight's Joe Buck made him a star both lost Best Actor to classical cowboy John Wayne for True Grit. The film was later re-rated R by the MPAA.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1969</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0025</DIV><DIV class="tc">"I love to shoot film" is the sanguine motto of TV lensman John Cassellis (Robert Forster) in Haskell Wexler's 1969 Medium Cool a semi-documentary investigation of image-making and politics. With his soundman Gus (Peter Bonerz) John films such events as gruesome car wrecks with frosty detachment considering himself a mere recorder of circumstances his only responsibility to get his film in on time. Even his girlfriend Ruth (Marianna Hill) cannot understand or penetrate John's complacency. Encounters with signs of the late '60s times however raise John's consciousness about the implications of his job as he films a verbal attack by black militants on the media's racism gets fired after he objects to having that footage turned over to the FBI and meets Vietnam War widow Eileen (Verna Bloom). John witnesses the violence of the state firsthand as he and Eileen search for her son amidst the real-life demonstrations and riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention. Even though he realizes the political power of pointing a camera at anything John finally cannot extricate himself or his loved ones from a culture obsessed with recording any sensational gory incident. Scripted (from a novel by Jack Couffer) directed and shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer and political activist Wexler Medium Cool systematically questions the ideological power of images by combining documentary techniques such as "talking heads" and cinéma vérité with staged scenes between the actors. By the time Wexler and his crew start filming Forster and Bloom among the actual events at the convention all barriers between fiction and fact are broken down as Wexler's assistant can be heard warning "Watch out Haskell it's real" when tear gas is thrown. The footage of cops clubbing people in the crowd is real but Wexler's presence also turns it into part of a fictional story revealing filmed "reality" to be as artificially constructed as any other fiction subject to the interpretation of whoever holds the camera and perhaps to larger institutions of power. Funding Medium Cool partly out of his own resources Wexler had free reign during production but when the execs at Paramount saw the result they were not pleased. Despite the timely subject matter Paramount delayed and then curtailed the film's release tempering its impact on critics and audiences. Regardless of that record Medium Cool stands as a vital late-'60s film for its incisive narrative and formal dissection of the visual politics of "truth" and its awareness of how coolly seductive televised violence might be as entertainment especially in a historical moment marked by incendiary images of political assassinations the Vietnam War the civil rights movement and counterculture protests.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1969</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0030</DIV><DIV class="tc">Produced by Hollywood iconoclast BBS Productions film critic-turned-director Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film pays homage to Hollywood's classical age as it chronicles generational rites of passage in Anarene a fictional one-horse Texas town. In 1951 high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football go to the movies at the Royal Theater hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas Sonny is left behind in Anarene wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white with a restrained style devoid of the kind of "new wave" techniques (jump cuts zooms and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn Robert Altman Mike Nichols and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940) Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941) The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters was not as successful.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1971</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0031</DIV><DIV class="tc">A disaffected man seeks a sense of identity in one of the key films of Hollywood's 1970s New Wave. Once a promising pianist from a family of classical musicians Bobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson in his first major starring role) leads a blue-collar life as an oil rigger living with needy waitress girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black) and bowling with their friends Elton (Billy \"Green\" Bush) and Stoney (Fannie Flagg). Feeling suffocated by responsibilities Bobby seeks out his sister Tita (Lois Smith) and discovering that his father is gravely ill he reluctantly heads back to the patrician family compound in Puget Sound with a pregnant Rayette in tow. After a road trip featuring a harangue from hitchhiker Palm (Helena Kallianiotes) about filth and Bobby's ill-fated attempt to make a menu substitution in a diner he tucks Rayette away in a motel before heading to the house. There Bobby seduces his uptight brother Carl's cultured fiancée Catherine (Susan Anspach) but Rayette shows up unexpectedly. As Rayette's crassness collides with the snobbery of the Dupea circle Bobby loses patience with both sides. After trying to reconcile with his mute father Bobby departs unwilling to give in to either destiny. Director Bob Rafelson and screenwriter Adrien Joyce (aka Carole Eastman) used the creative control afforded by the low budget to craft a European-influenced character study catching a cultural mood of anomie and resentment as it was embodied in Bobby. Neither older generation nor hippie Bobby fits in nowhere and his desire for independence conflicts with his emotional emptiness. Nicholson's nuanced performance of simmering frustration resonated with 1970 audiences caught between Nixon's "silent majority" and the troubled counterculture; a substantial hit Five Easy Pieces was nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor and established Nicholson as a star. Offering no "easy" answers to Bobby's existential crisis Five Easy Pieces is one of the pre-eminent films in the early-'70s cycle of alienated American art movies as even the fantasy of rebellion is reduced to merely running away.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1970</DIV></DIV>

At the behest of Iron John-esque Lewis (Burt Reynolds) the less adventuresome Ed (Jon Voight) Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) agree to canoe down an uncharted section of the river before a dam project ruins the region. After warnings from the grimy impoverished locals and Drew's tuneful yet ominous "Dueling Banjos" encounter with a mute inbred boy the four men embark on their trip exulting in the beauty of nature and the initial thrill of the rapids. The next day however things begin to take a turn for the worse when Bobby and Ed decide to rest on shore after becoming separated from Lewis and Drew. Two rifle-wielding mountain men (Bill McKinney and Herbert \"Cowboy\" Coward) emerge from the woods tying up Ed while one of them rapes Bobby and makes him "squeal like a pig." Lewis and Drew rescue them but the attack irrevocably changes the tenor of the journey. As the river gets rougher and rougher the men come to nightmarish grips with what it means to survive outside the safety net of "civilization."</DIV><DIV class="tc">1972</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0009</DIV><DIV class="tc">Steven Soderbergh kickstarted the independent film movement of the 1990s with this landmark drama about the tangled relationships among four people and a video camera. John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships. Together with Quentin Tarantino's very different Pulp Fiction (1994) sex lies and videotape was one of the most influential movies for independent filmmaking of the 1990s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">99</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0032</DIV><DIV class="tc">Though he made allusions to his own life in all of his films Fanny and Alexander was the first overtly autobiographical film by Ingmar Bergman. Taking his time throughout (188 minutes to be exact) Bergman recreates several episodes from his youth using as conduits the fictional Ekdahl family. Alexander the director's alter ego is first seen at age 10 at a joyous and informal Christmas gathering of relatives and servants. Fanny is Alexander's sister; both suffer an emotional shakedown when their recently-widowed mother (Ewa Froling) marries a cold and distant minister. Stripped of their creature comforts and relaxed family atmosphere Fanny and Alexander suddenly find their childhood unendurable. The kids' grandmother (Gunn Wallgren) "kidnaps" Fanny and Alexander for the purpose of showering them with the first kindness and affection that they've had since their father's death. This "purge" of the darker elements of Fanny and Alexander's existence is accomplished at the unintentional (but applaudable) cost of the hated stepfather's life. Ingmar Bergman insisted that Fanny and Alexander originally a multipart television series pared down to feature-film length represented his final theatrical film though within a year after its release he was busy with several additional Swedish TV projects and his final work the 2003 Saraband (also produced for Swedish television) eventually received global theatrical distribution. Oscars went to Fanny and Alexander for Best Foreign Film Best Cinematography (Sven Nykvist) Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration.</DIV><DIV class="tc">188</DIV></DIV>

H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed" short for Edwina (Holly Hunter) the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts and they move to the Arizona desert where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that as Hi puts it "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores has become the father of quintuplets and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you helps me" situation Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden.</DIV><DIV class="tc">94</DIV></DIV>

He creates an extremely resilient flying rubber dubbed "Flubber" and manages to make his old Model-T bounce all the way to Washington DC where it is mistaken for a UFO as well as helping the college basketball team win the big game with Flubber-powered sneakers. MacMurray is a lot of fun in the title role ably supported by a cast including Tommy Kirk Keenan Wynn and Leon Ames although the central romance between MacMurray and huffy bride-to-be Nancy Olson gets a bit annoying in its repetitiveness. In all however this is one of the best children's films of the '60s and is highly recommended. A sequel Son of Flubber followed with a remake simply titled Flubber appearing in 1997.</DIV><DIV class="tc">97</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0134</DIV><DIV class="tc">Arguably Luchino Visconti's best film and certainly the most personal of his historical epics The Leopard chronicles the fortunes of Prince Fabrizio Salina and his family during the unification of Italy in the 1860s. Based on the acclaimed novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa published posthumously in 1958 and subsequently translated into all European languages the picture opens as Salina (Burt Lancaster) learns that Garibaldi's troops have embarked in Sicily. While the Prince sees the event as an obvious threat to his current social status his opportunistic nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) becomes an officer in Garibaldi's army and returns home a war hero. Tancredi starts courting the beautiful Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) a daughter of the town's newly appointed Mayor Don Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa). Though the Prince despises Don Calogero as an upstart who made a fortune on land speculation during the recent social upheaval he reluctantly agrees to his nephew's marriage understanding how much this alliance would mean for the impecunious Tancredi. Painfully realizing the aristocracy's obsolescence in the wake of the new class of bourgeoisie the Prince later declines an offer from a governmental emissary to become a senator in the new Parliament in Turin. The closing section an almost hour-long ball is often cited as one of the most spectacular sequences in film history. Burt Lancaster is magnificent in the first of his patriarchal roles and the rest of the cast especially Delon and Cardinale become almost perfect incarnations of the novel's characters. Filmed in glorious Techniscope and rich in period detail the film is a remarkable cinematic achievement in all departments. The version that won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival ran 205 minutes. Inexplicably the picture was subsequently distributed by 20th Century Fox in a poorly dubbed 165-min.

Filmed in New England and Puerto Rico the 152-minute drama opens with a pre-credit sequence showing Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) and the other Africans in a violent takeover of the Amistad. Captured they are imprisoned in New England where former slave Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) viewing the rebels as "freedom fighters" approaches property lawyer Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) who attempts to prove the Africans were "stolen goods" because they were kidnapped. Running for re-election President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) overturns the lower court's decision in favor of the Africans. Former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is reluctant to become involved but when the case moves on to the Supreme Court Adams stirs emotions with a powerful defense. The storyline occasionally cuts away to Spain where the young Queen Isabella (Anna Paquin) plays with dolls; she later debated the Amistad case with seven U.S. presidents. The character portrayed by Morgan Freeman is a fictional composite of several historical figures. For authentic speech the Africans speak the Mende language subtitled during some scenes but not others.</DIV><DIV class="tc">152</DIV></DIV>

When we first see him he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936 running a booby-trapped gauntlet (complete with an over-sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman) who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes snakes. The next time we see Jones he's a soft-spoken bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis it seems are already searching for the Ark which the mystical-minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy's old friend Abner Ravenwood whose daughter Marion (Karen Allen) evidently has a "history" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences Indy and Marion become partners in one action-packed adventure after another ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman among others Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate) Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) as well as a short-lived TV-series "prequel."</DIV><DIV class="tc">115</DIV></DIV>

Spanning four decades the film tells the story of David "Noodles" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his Jewish pals chronicling their childhoods on New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s through their gangster careers in the 1930s and culminating in Noodles' 1968 return to New York from self-imposed exile at which time he learns the truth about the fate of his friends and again confronts the nightmare of his past. The acting the re-creation of the time period the cinematography and the music are all superb. However even more important is Leone's ability to make the film work on so many different levels: it's both a criticism of gangster-film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history. Strange as it may seem the violence and gore in the first half of the film turn into a sad elegy about wasted lives and lost love. The film's strengths emerge only in its full 229-minute version -- the 139-minute and other edited versions don't make nearly the same impact.</DIV><DIV class="tc">229</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0251</DIV><DIV class="tc">"He wanted to die with me and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms." A young couple goes on a Midwest crime spree in Terrence Malick's hypnotically assured debut feature based on the 1950s Starkweather-Fugate murders. Fancying himself a rebel like James Dean twentysomething Kit (Martin Sheen) takes off with teen baton-twirler Holly (Sissy Spacek) after shooting her father (Warren Oates) when he tries to split the pair up. Once bounty hunters discover their riverside hiding place Kit and Holly head toward Saskatchewan leaving dead bodies in their wake. As the law closes in however Holly gives herself up -- but Kit doesn't hold it against her as he basks in his new status as a momentary folk hero. Inaugurating the use of voice-over narration that he would continue in Days of Heaven (1978) and The Thin Red Line (1998) Malick juxtaposes Holly's flat readings of her flowery romance-novel diary prose with the banal and surreal details of their journey. Singularly inarticulate with each other Kit and Holly are more intrigued by mythic celebrity gestures as Holly peruses her fan magazines and Kit commemorates key moments before orchestrating a properly dramatic capture for himself (complete with the right hat). The sublime visuals lend a dreamlike beauty to the couple's trip even as their actions are treated casually; Malick neither glamorizes Kit and Holly nor consigns them to the bloody end of their fame-fixated predecessors in Bonnie and Clyde (1967). With the couple's opaque dialogue and Holly's fanzine dream narration Malick further denies an easy explanation for their crimes. Made for under 500000 dollars Badlands debuted at the 1973 New York Film Festival along with Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and was released within months of two other outlaw-couple road movies Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express and Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us. Although Badlands did not make an impression at the box office its pictorial splendor and cool yet disquieting narrative established Malick as one of the most compelling artists to come out of early-'70s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">95</DIV></DIV>

Ben Gazzara plays Cosmo Vitelli the owner of a sleazy Los Angeles strip joint who loses $20000 at a mob gambling club owned by a small time gangster (Seymour Cassel). Since Cosmo doesn't have the $20000 he is forced to murder a Chinese bookie in order to clear his debt to the mob. What Cosmo doesn't know is he's part of a set-up. The bookie is actually a West Coast mob boss protected around the clock by bodyguards. The mobsters figure that Cosmo will be killed in an impossible hit and they can take over his nightclub. But Cosmo proves luckier than the mobsters think -- he manages to kill his target and now the mobsters have to track down Cosmo and kill him. Initially at 133 minutes the movie was subsequently re-edited by Cassavetes to 109 minutes.</DIV><DIV class="tc">109</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:31 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0305</DIV><DIV class="tc">ased on the Holy Scriptures with additional dialogue by several other hands The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out "in solid" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids dispensing such construction-site advice as "Blood makes poor mortar") but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner) Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. "Where's your Moses now?" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film--and who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like "Oh Moses Moses you splendid stubborn adorable fool"?</DIV><DIV class="tc">219</DIV></DIV>

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is a nun and teacher living in rural Louisiana. One day she receives a letter from Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is scheduled to be executed soon for the rape and murder of two teenagers. After meeting Matthew Sister Helen agrees to serve as spiritual counselor and see what she can do to stay the execution. However Matthew's claims of innocence seem shaky at best and it's clear he's a reprehensible amoral racist. When it becomes obvious that Matthew's sentence will be carried out Sister Helen offers what comfort she can to Matthew but also tries to guide him to an open admission of the extent of his crimes and an acceptance of divine forgiveness telling him "I want the last face you see to be the face of love." Susan Sarandon won an Oscar for her performance as Sister Prejean and Sean Penn was similarly nominated for Best Actor as Matthew.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) a mute who has willed herself not to speak and her strong-willed young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) find themselves in the New Zealand wilderness with Ada the imported bride of dullard land-grabber Stewart (Sam Neill). Ada immediately takes a dislike to Stewart when he refuses to carry her beloved piano home with them. But Stewart makes a deal with his overseer George Baines (Harvey Keitel) to take the piano off his hands. Attracted to Ada Baines agrees to return the piano in exchange for a series of piano lessons that become a series of increasingly charged sexual encounters. As pent-up emotions of rage and desire swirl around all three characters the savage wilderness begins to consume the tiny European enclave. Campion imbues her tale with an over-ripe tactility and a murky poetic undertow that betray the characters' confined yet overpowering emotions: Ada's buried sensuality Baines' hidden tenderness and Stewart's suppressed anger and violence. The story unfolds like a Greek tragedy of the Outback complete with a Greek chorus of Maori tribesmen and a blithely uncaring natural environment that envelops the characters like an additional player. Campion directs with discreet detachment observing one character through the glances and squints of another as they peer through wooden slats airy curtains and the spaces between a character's fingers. She makes the film immediate and urgent by implicating the audience in characters' gazes. And she guides Hunter to a revelatory performance of silent film majesty. Relying on expressive glances and using body language to convey her soulful depths Hunter became a modern Lillian Gish and won an Oscar for her performance as did Paquin and Campion for her screenplay. Campion achieved something rare in contemporary cinema: a poetry of expression told in the form of an off-center melodrama.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti a mother of three whose husband Nick (Peter Falk) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous extroverted and fragile while he's controlling distant and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence. Like its title heroine the film threatens to veer out of control at any time its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship from seismic bursts of high drama to small even trivial moments of domestic tedium its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly illuminating and frustrating and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Travolta plays Tony Manero a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including "Stayin' Alive") we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978 when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970s disco culture. Two versions of this film exist: the original R-rated version and a PG version edited down to more "family-friendly" fare and fed to the public with the tagline "Because we want everyone to see John Travolta's performance."</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act the film flashes back to 1940s New York when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob however will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) but success does nothing to exorcise his demons even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey and disastrously gaining weight Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom however Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: "I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody." Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations it underperformed at the box office as audiences increasingly turned away from "difficult" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar as did the film's editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">R</DIV></DIV>

He gets swindled by gimpy tubercular grifter Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) but when Joe falls in the direst of straits Ratso takes Joe into his condemned apartment so that they can help each other survive. Things start to look up when Joe finally lands his first legit female customer (Brenda Vaccaro) at a Warhol-esque party; Ratso's health however fails. Joe turns a final trick to get the money for one selfless goal: taking Ratso out of New York to his dream life in Miami. One of the first major studio films given the newly minted X rating for its then-frank portrayal of New York decadence Midnight Cowboy was critically praised for Schlesinger's insight into American lives with the intercut mosaic of Joe's memories and Ratso's dreams lending their characters and actions greater psychological complexity. While they may have been drawn by the seamy content (tame by current standards) the young late '60s audience responded to Joe's and Ratso's confusion amidst turbulent times and to the connection they make with each other despite their alienation from the surrounding culture. Midnight Cowboy became one of the major financial and artistic hits of 1969 winning Oscars for Best Picture (the first for an X-rated film) Best Director and former blacklistee Waldo Salt's screenplay. Though the one-two punch of Midnight Cowboy and The Graduate (1967) proved Hoffman's range and Voight's Joe Buck made him a star both lost Best Actor to classical cowboy John Wayne for True Grit.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0004</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Hong Kong fast food restaurant acts as the link between two unusual stories of police officers in love in this eccentric stylish comedy-drama. Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Hong Kong</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0010</DIV><DIV class="tc">Originally released in India as Apur Sansar The World of Apu was the last of Satyajit Ray's "Apu Trilogy." Pather Panchali (1955) covered Apu's early years in his native village while Aparajito (1956) detailed his school years and the tragedy that temporarily brought him back home. Now Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) having abandoned college due to lack of money hopes to find success as a writer. He is sidetracked from this goal when he meets Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) whose impending wedding is canceled when the groom turns out to be mentally unstable. To save Aparna from a custom-dictated life of spinsterhood Apu marries her himself. When she dies giving birth the grieving Apu cannot bring himself to meet his son and in fact deserts the boy for five years before learning how to gracefully accept his lot in life. Like the other entries in the trilogy The World of Apu was based on Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhaya's semi-autobiographical novel Aparajito. In the manner typical of his earlier works director Ray adopts a straightforward realistic approach avoiding any sort of attention-getting directorial techniques the better to simply tell his story.</DIV><DIV class="tc">India</DIV></DIV>

After gauzily-photographed nicely underplayed scenes of the girls' budding sexuality being restrained in Victorian corsets the uptight headmistress (Rachel Roberts) takes them on a Valentine's Day picnic into the countryside and several of the girls led by the lovely Miranda (Anne Lambert) decide to explore a nearby volcanic rock formation. It's a desolate primitive vaguely menacing place where one can almost feel the presence of ancient pagan spirits. Something -- and there is an unspoken but palpable emphasis on the inherent carnality of the place -- draws four of the girls to explore the rock. Three never return. No one ever finds out why. The repercussions for the school are tragic and of course Roberts reacts with near-crazed anger but what really happened? Weir gives enough clues to suggest any number of explanations both physical and supernatural.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australia</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0021</DIV><DIV class="tc">Pather Panchali (Father Panchali) Indian director Satyajit Ray's first feature film relates the story of an impoverished Bengalese family. When the father (Karuna Bannerjee) leaves for the city to pursue a writing career the mother (Karuna Banerji) is left with the responsibility of caring for the rest of the brood. Gradually the film's true central character emerges: Apu (Subir Banerji) the family's son. Though excruciatingly realistic at times Pather Panchali takes an occasional timeout to dwell on the purely cinematic. For example when the mother receives a postcard bearing good news Ray dissolves to a pond where a pair of water skates scamper about. The music by Ravi Shankar at first seems to be at odds with the action; soon however we come to accept the music as a logical outgrowth of the events at hand. A multiple award winner Pather Panchali was the first of Ray's celebrated "Apu Trilogy" (the other two entries were 1956's Aparajito and 1959's The World of Apu). The film was also released as The Song of the Road and The Lament of the Path.</DIV><DIV class="tc">India</DIV></DIV>

The film opens with a freak hailstorm in Australia's outback. Cut to David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) a well-to-do Sydney corporate lawyer plagued by visions of impending doom who is assigned to defend five accused of murdering a fellow Aborigine. The case itself proves to be mysterious -- no exact cause of death can be determined by the pathologist and the accused remain strangely tight-lipped about the whole affair. As his visions grow increasingly weird and intense Burton sees in his dream one of the five Aborigines Chris (David Gulpili of Walkabout fame) who is drenched and clutching a sacred rock. Burton's interest in the case slides into complete obsession and he comes to believe that not only was the murder related to an underground urban tribe of Aborigines but that Australia is about to be decimated by a massive apocalyptic tidal wave.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australia</DIV></DIV>

Tsutomu Yamazaki plays Goro a truck driver who helps a young widow named Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) improve her noodle restaurant. Over the course of the film the story drifts around not only following the stories of Tampopo her son and Goro but also a number of customers who come through the diner including an old woman (Izumi Hara) who insists on squeezing the cheese at a market and a criminal (Ken Watanabe) with a food-based kink. Tampopo was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1988 Independent Spirit Awards.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Japan</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0086</DIV><DIV class="tc">A young pig fights convention to become a sheep dog -- or rather sheep pig -- in this charming Australian family film which became an unexpected international success due to superior special effects and an intelligent script. The title refers to the name bestowed on a piglet soon after his separation from his family when he finds himself on a strange farm. Confused and sad Babe is adopted by a friendly dog and slowly adjusts to his new home. Discovering that the fate of most pigs is the dinner table Babe devotes himself to becoming a useful member of the farm by trying to learn how to herd sheep despite the skepticism of the other animals and the kindly but conventional Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). Because technically impeccable animatronics and computer graphics allow the farm animals to converse easily among themselves first-time director Chris Noonan can treat the film's menagerie as actual characters playing scene not for cuteness but for real emotions. The result is often surprisingly touching with Noonan and George Miller's script based on Dick King-Smith's children's book and indirectly a true story seamlessly combining gentle whimsy and sincere feeling. These same qualities are embodied by in Cromwell's beautifully understated performance as Farmer Hoggett which anchors the film. Despite its unlikely premise and low profile Babe's inspirational story was embraced by audiences and critics and the movie became an international sleeper that won an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It was followed in 1999 by the less successful Babe: Pig in the City.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australia</DIV></DIV>

Upon badgering her mother into giving her a 500-toman banknote Razieh heads off to the marketplace alone; it is her first real experience away from her parents' watchful eyes and the excitement and wonder she feels is palpable. Told in real time the film's sensitive portrayal of Razieh's wide-eyed misadventures superbly conveys the impact which an otherwise unremarkable chain of events can indelibly leave upon the life of a child. Her struggle to prove her independence is dramatically undercut when she loses the banknote not once but twice but her spirit and ingenuity nevertheless remain indefatigable.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Iran</DIV></DIV>

The story centers on the exploits of Master Wong Fei-hung (a familiar figure in Hong Kong cinema) a 19th-century doctor Confucian and exceptional martial artist. As the film begins he has just opened a new clinic in Canton Province. To help him with patients he hires a few apprentices including Porky Lang (the comic relief) and Buck Teeth Sol who was raised outside China and barely can speak the language. Wong is platonically involved with the lovely worldly Aunt Yee who has been abroad most of her life. Wong soon gets in trouble when he begins using his skills to protect and assist the poor and helpless in his community. As a result someone torches his clinic forcing Wong and his compadres to set off and get spectacularly staged revenge. They also try vainly to stop Western culture from changing traditional Chinese ways but they soon find that they may as well be shoveling sand against a rising tide.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Hong Kong</DIV></DIV>

Opposing them is various groups of blackguards and mercenaries along with Adolf (Aldo Sanbrell) -- the last surviving soldier from the original company -- who is hell-bent on getting the gold himself. Soon two of Jackie's companions find themselves sold into slavery while Jackie battles the baddies in a massive WWII-era wind tunnel.

For example when the mother receives a postcard bearing good news Ray dissolves to a pond where a pair of water skates scamper about. The music by Ravi Shankar at first seems to be at odds with the action; soon however we come to accept the music as a logical outgrowth of the events at hand. A multiple award winner Pather Panchali was the first of Ray's celebrated "Apu Trilogy" (the other two entries were 1956's Aparajito and 1959's The World of Apu).

The film opens with a freak hailstorm in Australia's outback. Cut to David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) a well-to-do Sydney corporate lawyer plagued by visions of impending doom who is assigned to defend five accused of murdering a fellow Aborigine. The case itself proves to be mysterious -- no exact cause of death can be determined by the pathologist and the accused remain strangely tight-lipped about the whole affair. As his visions grow increasingly weird and intense Burton sees in his dream one of the five Aborigines Chris (David Gulpili of Walkabout fame) who is drenched and clutching a sacred rock. Burton's interest in the case slides into complete obsession and he comes to believe that not only was the murder related to an underground urban tribe of Aborigines but that Australia is about to be decimated by a massive apocalyptic tidal wave.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australia</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0086</DIV><DIV class="tc">A young pig fights convention to become a sheep dog -- or rather sheep pig -- in this charming Australian family film which became an unexpected international success due to superior special effects and an intelligent script. The title refers to the name bestowed on a piglet soon after his separation from his family when he finds himself on a strange farm. Confused and sad Babe is adopted by a friendly dog and slowly adjusts to his new home. Discovering that the fate of most pigs is the dinner table Babe devotes himself to becoming a useful member of the farm by trying to learn how to herd sheep despite the skepticism of the other animals and the kindly but conventional Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). Because technically impeccable animatronics and computer graphics allow the farm animals to converse easily among themselves first-time director Chris Noonan can treat the film's menagerie as actual characters playing scene not for cuteness but for real emotions. The result is often surprisingly touching with Noonan and George Miller's script based on Dick King-Smith's children's book and indirectly a true story seamlessly combining gentle whimsy and sincere feeling. These same qualities are embodied by in Cromwell's beautifully understated performance as Farmer Hoggett which anchors the film. Despite its unlikely premise and low profile Babe's inspirational story was embraced by audiences and critics and the movie became an international sleeper that won an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It was followed in 1999 by the less successful Babe: Pig in the City.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australia</DIV></DIV>

Upon badgering her mother into giving her a 500-toman banknote Razieh heads off to the marketplace alone; it is her first real experience away from her parents' watchful eyes and the excitement and wonder she feels is palpable. Told in real time the film's sensitive portrayal of Razieh's wide-eyed misadventures superbly conveys the impact which an otherwise unremarkable chain of events can indelibly leave upon the life of a child.

The story centers on the exploits of Master Wong Fei-hung (a familiar figure in Hong Kong cinema) a 19th-century doctor Confucian and exceptional martial artist. As the film begins he has just opened a new clinic in Canton Province. To help him with patients he hires a few apprentices including Porky Lang (the comic relief) and Buck Teeth Sol who was raised outside China and barely can speak the language. Wong is platonically involved with the lovely worldly Aunt Yee who has been abroad most of her life. Wong soon gets in trouble when he begins using his skills to protect and assist the poor and helpless in his community. As a result someone torches his clinic forcing Wong and his compadres to set off and get spectacularly staged revenge. They also try vainly to stop Western culture from changing traditional Chinese ways but they soon find that they may as well be shoveling sand against a rising tide.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Hong Kong</DIV></DIV>

Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Hong Kong</DIV></DIV>

After gauzily-photographed nicely underplayed scenes of the girls' budding sexuality being restrained in Victorian corsets the uptight headmistress (Rachel Roberts) takes them on a Valentine's Day picnic into the countryside and several of the girls led by the lovely Miranda (Anne Lambert) decide to explore a nearby volcanic rock formation. It's a desolate primitive vaguely menacing place where one can almost feel the presence of ancient pagan spirits. Something -- and there is an unspoken but palpable emphasis on the inherent carnality of the place -- draws four of the girls to explore the rock. Three never return. No one ever finds out why. The repercussions for the school are tragic and of course Roberts reacts with near-crazed anger but what really happened?

National Lampoon's Animal House is set in 1962 on the campus of Faber College in Faber PA. The first glimpse we get of the campus is the statue of its founder Emil Faber on the base of which is inscribed the motto "Knowledge Is Good." Incoming freshmen Larry "Pinto" Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent "Flounder" Dorfman (Stephen Furst) find themselves rejected by the pretentious Omega fraternity and instead pledge to Delta House. The Deltas are a motley fraternity of rejects and maladjusted undergraduates (some approaching their late twenties) whose main goal -- seemingly accomplished in part by their mere presence on campus -- is disrupting the staid peaceful rigidly orthodox and totally hypocritical social order of the school as represented by the Omegas and the college's dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon). Dean Wormer decides that this is the year he's going to get the Deltas expelled and their chapter decertified; he places the fraternity on "double secret probation" and with help from Omega president Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) and hard-nosed member Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf) starts looking for any pretext on which to bring the members of the Delta fraternity up on charges. The Deltas oblivious to the danger they're in are having a great time steeped in irreverence mild debauchery and occasional drunkenness led by seniors Otter (Tim Matheson) Hoover (James Widdoes) D-Day (Bruce McGill) Boon (Peter Riegert) and pledge master John "Bluto" Blutarsky (John Belushi). They're given enough rope to hang themselves but even then manage to get into comical misadventures on a road trip (where they arrange an assignation with a group of young ladies from Emily Dickinson University). Finally they are thrown out of school and as a result stripped of their student deferments (and thus eligible for the draft). They decide to commit one last utterly senseless (and screamingly funny) slapstick act of rebellion making a shambles of the university's annual homecoming parade and in the process getting revenge on the dean the Omegas and everyone else who has ever gone against them.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Animal House</DIV></DIV>

The "group" started as an informal skiffle band eventually maturing into an R&amp;B act called the Thamesmen (their hit was "Gimme Some Money").

Late in the Third Century B.C. when China was comprised of seven rival kingdoms Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian) was the leader of Qin. Ying Zheng had a dream in which he joined together the seven kingdoms into a single utopian state and taking this as a mandate from God he invaded the nearby state of Han as the first step toward this goal. However not everyone in the neighboring states was happy with Ying Zheng's crusade which seemed to indicate a lengthy war with many casualties. Lady Zhao (Gong Li) Ying's lover devised a scheme to help Ying Zheng take over the nearby and uncooperative state of Yan; she fabricated a fake assassination plot against him and framed the leader of Yan once Ying Zheng's childhood friend as the man behind the murderous plot. However Lady Zhao did not choose the would-be assassin wisely; while Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi) loved her and was willing to do her bidding Jing Ke's previous assassination assignment caused the unintended death of an innocent blind girl which left him full of regret and a bit unstable. When Jing Ke learned a closely guarded secret about Ying Zheng's past he became blindly determined to kill the would-be emperor whatever the cost. Produced on a lavish budget by Chinese standards ($15 million) Jing Ke Ci Qin Wang/The Emperor and the Assassin was directed by Chen Kaige best known to Western audiences for the international success Farewell My Concubine.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Jing Ke Ci Qin Wang</DIV></DIV>

During the period of the Black Death Hamish believes that he can rescue his fellow villagers by leading them into an abandoned mine. The fugitives tunnel their way through the darkness and emerge on the other side--into a bustling New Zealand metropolis in the year 1988. The phenomenon is seen from the point of view of the "aliens" to whom every modern convenience and invention is a miracle comparable to the Resurrection. The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey successfully creates and sustains its own logic framing the story in the linear form of an ancient legend and never treating the bedazzled time-travellers in a condescending manner.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Navigator</DIV></DIV>

Colonel Iceal Hambleton (Gene Hackman) whose plane is shot down over enemy territory while on reconnaissance behind enemy lines in Vietnam. Because Hambleton used to call the shots from behind a desk he lacks combat survival experience and is forced to adapt while the enemy surrounds him on all sides. As the Air Force plans a risky rescue mission he is befriended by pilot Bartholomew Clark (Danny Glover) who can't land to pick up Hambleton due to the enemy activity but keeps him company by radio. Hambleton's plight takes a turn for the worse once the brass decide to execute an intensive bombing mission in the area whether or not they can rescue Hambleton. The colonel meanwhile confronted for the first time by the horrors of war begins to reassess his role in the bloodshed. An overlooked film at the time of its release Bat 21 is a smaller war picture that focuses on an ordinary man in an excruciating situation and how it ultimately changes his life.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Bat*21</DIV></DIV>

The story for the tiny number of people not familiar with it concerns a farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who discovers that the used robot recently purchased by his family plays back a message from one Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) begging for help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke asks his father's friend Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) about this and he discovers that Ben and Obi-Wan are one and the same. Kenobi tells Luke of the battle of the rebels against the ruling Empire and the spiritual energy called "The Force." Soon Luke Kenobi and a mercenary named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) join forces to rescue Princess Leia from the Empire's mammoth warship the Death Star controlled by evil genius Darth Vader (David Prowse with the voice of James Earl Jones). George Lucas has frequently cited the influence of several films on Star Wars particularly Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo and John Ford's The Searchers as well as the original Flash Gordon serials. After Star Wars became a success Lucas announced his intention to turn the film into a series originally totalling nine films (later pared back to six). Consequently most reissue prints now feature the title Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope with The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) serving as Episodes Five and Six in the serial and Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace (1999) going back to the myth's beginnings.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Star Wars : Episode IV - A New Hope</DIV></DIV>

One such unfortunate survivor is young Arthur who remains in Paris after his recovery to work in the hospital unaware (at first) of the circumstances which brought him there. Although there are many amusingly weird moments this black comedy is a bit too deadpan for its own good and may be too talky and meandering for horror fans.

Mathilda doesn't much care for her parents but she has a close bond with her four-year-old brother. One day she returns from running an errand to discover that most of her family including her brother have been killed in a raid by corrupt DEA agents led by the psychotic Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Mathilda takes refuge in the apartment of her secretive neighbor Leon (Jean Reno) who takes her in with a certain reluctance. She discovers that Leon is a professional assassin working for Tony (Danny Aiello) a mob kingpin based in Little Italy. Wanting to avenge the death of her brother Mathilda makes a deal with Leon to become his protégée in exchange for work as a domestic servant hoping to learn the hitman's trade and take out the men who took her brother's life. However an affection develops between Leon and Mathilda that changes his outlook on his life and career. Besson's first American film boasted a strong performance from Jean Reno a striking debut by Natalie Portman and a love-it-or-hate-it over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman.

As Georgian mayor Varlam Aravidze Makharadze is a strutting arbitrarily cruel dictator something of a composite Stalin and Hitler. Visually he very closely resembles Lavrentiy Beriya Stalin's right hander and one-time KGB chief. As Abel the mayor's son Makharadze finds himself in the middle of an ideological squabble when his father dies. Zeinab Botsvadze a local woman who had suffered mightily under the mayor's regime refuses to allow the old man's corpse to be interred. Despite the son's Herculean efforts Botsvadze continues digging up the late mayor's body a symbolic gesture to prevent the dead man's villainy from being forgotten. Repentance was the first Soviet film that openly denounced the horrors of Stalinism though the Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze (known for his poetic and surrealist films) chose to make it allegorical deliberately using anachronisms and making the leading character look like a combination of Stalin's henchman Lavrenti Beriya Hitler and Mussolini. An interesting point -- the last name chosen for the leading character is totally fictional there is no such name as Aravidze in Georgia. In fact "aravi" means "nobody" in Georgian. The filmmakers opted for such a name in order not to offend any real person in the Republic of Georgia. Filmed in 1984 Repentance fell victim to Soviet censorship from the moment it left the editing room. When it was finally released in 1987 the film was deservedly garlanded with several awards including the Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize.</DIV><DIV class="tc">title )</DIV></DIV>

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery.

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Lars von Trier</DIV></DIV>

Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Wong Kar - Wai</DIV></DIV>

Ada immediately takes a dislike to Stewart when he refuses to carry her beloved piano home with them. But Stewart makes a deal with his overseer George Baines (Harvey Keitel) to take the piano off his hands. Attracted to Ada Baines agrees to return the piano in exchange for a series of piano lessons that become a series of increasingly charged sexual encounters. As pent-up emotions of rage and desire swirl around all three characters the savage wilderness begins to consume the tiny European enclave. Campion imbues her tale with an over-ripe tactility and a murky poetic undertow that betray the characters' confined yet overpowering emotions: Ada's buried sensuality Baines' hidden tenderness and Stewart's suppressed anger and violence. The story unfolds like a Greek tragedy of the Outback complete with a Greek chorus of Maori tribesmen and a blithely uncaring natural environment that envelops the characters like an additional player. Campion directs with discreet detachment observing one character through the glances and squints of another as they peer through wooden slats airy curtains and the spaces between a character's fingers. She makes the film immediate and urgent by implicating the audience in characters' gazes. And she guides Hunter to a revelatory performance of silent film majesty. Relying on expressive glances and using body language to convey her soulful depths Hunter became a modern Lillian Gish and won an Oscar for her performance as did Paquin and Campion for her screenplay. Campion achieved something rare in contemporary cinema: a poetry of expression told in the form of an off-center melodrama.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Jane Campion</DIV></DIV>

Catherine Deneuve stars as a wealthy but bored newlywed eager to taste life to the fullest. She seemingly gets her wish early in the film when she is kidnapped tied to a tree and gang-raped. It turns out that this is only a daydream but her subsequent visits to a neighboring brothel where she offers her services certainly seem to be real. This illusion/reality dichotomy extends to the final scenes in which we are offered two possible endings. Thanks to a question of copyright and ownership Belle de Jour disappeared from view shortly after its 1967 release not even resurfacing on videotape. When it was reissued theatrically in 1994 many critics placed the perplexing but mesmerizing film on their lists of that year's best films.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Luis Buñuel</DIV></DIV>

John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships. Together with Quentin Tarantino's very different Pulp Fiction (1994) sex lies and videotape was one of the most influential movies for independent filmmaking of the 1990s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Steven Soderbergh</DIV></DIV>

Pather Panchali (1955) covered Apu's early years in his native village while Aparajito (1956) detailed his school years and the tragedy that temporarily brought him back home. Now Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) having abandoned college due to lack of money hopes to find success as a writer. He is sidetracked from this goal when he meets Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) whose impending wedding is canceled when the groom turns out to be mentally unstable. To save Aparna from a custom-dictated life of spinsterhood Apu marries her himself. When she dies giving birth the grieving Apu cannot bring himself to meet his son and in fact deserts the boy for five years before learning how to gracefully accept his lot in life. Like the other entries in the trilogy The World of Apu was based on Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhaya's semi-autobiographical novel Aparajito. In the manner typical of his earlier works director Ray adopts a straightforward realistic approach avoiding any sort of attention-getting directorial techniques the better to simply tell his story.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Satyajit Ray</DIV></DIV>

Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti a mother of three whose husband Nick (Peter Falk) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous extroverted and fragile while he's controlling distant and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence. Like its title heroine the film threatens to veer out of control at any time its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship from seismic bursts of high drama to small even trivial moments of domestic tedium its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly illuminating and frustrating and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.</DIV><DIV class="tc">John Cassavetes</DIV></DIV>

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Martin Scorsese</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0404</DIV><DIV class="tc">Das Boot is one of the most gripping and authentic war movies ever made. Based on an autobiographical novel by German World War II photographer Lothar-Guenther Buchheim the film follows the lives of a fearless U-Boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and his inexperienced crew as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean in search of Allied vessels taking turns as hunter and prey. There's very little plot so the movie's power comes from both its riveting epic battle scenes and its details of the boring hours spent waiting for orders or signs of the enemy. With the exception of one staunch Hitler Youth lieutenant none of the crew is particularly loyal to the Nazis and some are openly hostile toward their Fuhrer; this allows viewer sympathy with the men as they perform their laborious monotonous duties in cramped filthy quarters or await death as depth charges explode all around the sub. Prochnow is excellent as the nerves-of-steel commander and many of the supporting actors -- all German -- are solid as well although the characterizations border on war movie clichés (the young crewman who has left behind his pregnant girlfriend the Chief Engineer whose wife is seriously ill). The real star however is cinematographer Jost Vacano who makes the sub's grimy claustrophobic interior come to vivid life as his camera follows the crew through hatches up ladders into bunks and under pipes creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia while injecting it with movement. Originally edited by writer/director Wolfgang Petersen as both a two-and-a-half hour theatrical release and a six-hour German miniseries Das Boot was re-released in a restored version in 1997 with nearly one hour of added footage which made it even more suspenseful than before.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Sergeant Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster) enters into an affair with Karen (Deborah Kerr) the wife of his commanding officer. Private Robert E. Lee "Prew" Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) is a loner who lives by his own code of ethics and communicates better with his bugle than he does with words. Prew's best friend is wisecracking Maggio (Frank Sinatra in an Oscar-winning performance that revived his flagging career) who has been targeted for persecution by sadistic stockade sergeant Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine). Rounding out the principals is Alma Lorene (Donna Reed) a "hostess" at the euphemistically named whorehouse The New Congress Club. All these melodramatic joys and sufferings are swept away by the Japanese attack on the morning of December 7. No words could do justice to the film's most famous scene: the nocturnal romantic rendezvous on the beach with Burt Lancaster's and Deborah Kerr's bodies intertwining as the waves crash over them. If you're able to take your eyes off the principals for a moment or two keep an eye out for George Reeves; his supporting role was shaved down when during previews audiences yelled "There's Superman!" and began to laugh.

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) already on the edge is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to "Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all." Coppola himself was not certain either and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press the Palme d'Or-winning "work-in-progress" shown at Cannes and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself have been superbly captured in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0408</DIV><DIV class="tc">Francis Coppola had more than his share of production difficulties while shooting his epic-scale Vietnam War drama Apocalypse Now including disastrous weather conditions problems with his leading men (Harvey Keitel was fired after less than two weeks on the project and was replaced by Martin Sheen who suffered a heart attack midway through production) and a schedule and budget that quickly spiraled out of control (originally budgeted at $10 million the film's final cost was over $30 million). But Coppola's troubles didn't end when he got his footage into the editing room and he tinkered with a number of different structures and endings before settling on the film's 153-minute final cut in time for its initial theatrical release in 1979. Twenty-two years later Francis Coppola returned to the material and created Apocalypse Now Redux an expanded and re-edited version of the film that adds 53 minutes of footage excised from the film's original release. In addition to adding a number of smaller moments that even out the film's rhythms Apocalypse Now Redux restores two much-discussed sequences that Coppola chose not to include in his original edition of the film -- an encounter in the jungle between Willard (Martin Sheen) his crewmates Chief (Albert Hall) Clean (Larry Fishburne) Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) and a trio of stranded Playboy models on a U.S.O. tour as well as a stopover at a plantation operated by French colonists De Marais (Christian Marquand) and Roxanne (Aurore Clement). Apocalypse Now Redux received a limited theatrical release in August of 2001 after a well-received screening at the Cannes Film Festival -- the same month that the film finally reached theaters in 1979 after a rough cut received a Golden Palm award at the Cannes Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

James Caviezel stars as Private Witt a deserter living in peace and harmony with the natives of a Pacific island paradise. Captured by the Navy Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt goes ashore in the company of his fellow soldiers they meet diverse fates. Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson) is killed by an exploding grenade. Captain John Gaff (John Cusack) is an intelligent sober leader facing the destruction of his command because his commanding officer Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) is bucking for a general's star. Sergeant McCron (John Savage) loses his mind. Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) gets a "Dear John" letter from his beloved wife. However as the U.S. troops advance up grassy slopes toward entrenched Japanese positions it is Witt's voiced-over ruminations on life death and nature that are the real heart and soul of The Thin Red Line (1998). Adrien Brody appears as Private Fife the major character of Jones' novel and the author's alter-ego although Fife has been relegated to a minor supporting role by Malick's filmed adaptation.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Lt. Col. Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) was the commander of a unit during Operation Desert Storm who mistakenly ordered the destruction of what he believed to be an enemy tank only to discover that it actually held U.S. soldiers including a close friend. Since then Serling has been an emotional wreck drinking heavily and allowing his marriage to teeter on the brink of collapse. As a means of redeeming himself Serling is given a new assignment by his superior Gen. Hershberg (Michael Moriarty). Capt. Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) was a helicopter pilot who died in battle during the Iraqi conflict and the White House has proposed that Walden be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Serling is asked to investigate Walden's actions on the field of battle but he quickly discovers that no two stories about her are quite the same; Ilario (Matt Damon) says Walden acted heroically and sacrificed herself to save the others in her company while Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillps) claims she was a coward who was attempting to surrender to enemy troops. Meanwhile reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) is hounding Serling trying to get the inside story on Walden and on Serling's own difficulties. Matt Damon lost 40 pounds to prepare for his role in Courage Under Fire which resulted in a potentially life-threatening illness for the young actor.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Paratroops led by British major general Robert Urquhart (Sean Connery) and American brigadier general James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal) will seize a thin road and five bridges through Holland into Germany with paratroops led by Lieutenant Col.

Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin a schlemiel's schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior in honor of Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks or rather commands: "Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!" Before long the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective a sadistic dentist and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile Mr. Mushnik who has stumbled onto Seymour's secret has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith who also wrote the script and supplied the plant's voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s. By the mid-1970s it had attained classic status spawning a big-budget Broadway musical (and followup feature film) in the 1980s and a Saturday morning cartoon series in the 1990s. Enhancing the original Little Shop's reputation was the brief appearance by star-in-the-making Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (Nicholson is often incorrectly referred to as the star of the film though in fact he barely receives billing). Much as we love Nicholson our vote for the most memorable Little Shop cast member goes to the ubiquitous Dick Miller ("No thanks I'll eat it here").</DIV><DIV class="tc">Horror</DIV></DIV>

Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to "Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all." Coppola himself was not certain either and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press the Palme d'Or-winning "work-in-progress" shown at Cannes and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself have been superbly captured in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0408</DIV><DIV class="tc">Francis Coppola had more than his share of production difficulties while shooting his epic-scale Vietnam War drama Apocalypse Now including disastrous weather conditions problems with his leading men (Harvey Keitel was fired after less than two weeks on the project and was replaced by Martin Sheen who suffered a heart attack midway through production) and a schedule and budget that quickly spiraled out of control (originally budgeted at $10 million the film's final cost was over $30 million). But Coppola's troubles didn't end when he got his footage into the editing room and he tinkered with a number of different structures and endings before settling on the film's 153-minute final cut in time for its initial theatrical release in 1979. Twenty-two years later Francis Coppola returned to the material and created Apocalypse Now Redux an expanded and re-edited version of the film that adds 53 minutes of footage excised from the film's original release. In addition to adding a number of smaller moments that even out the film's rhythms Apocalypse Now Redux restores two much-discussed sequences that Coppola chose not to include in his original edition of the film -- an encounter in the jungle between Willard (Martin Sheen) his crewmates Chief (Albert Hall) Clean (Larry Fishburne) Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) and a trio of stranded Playboy models on a U.S.O. tour as well as a stopover at a plantation operated by French colonists De Marais (Christian Marquand) and Roxanne (Aurore Clement). Apocalypse Now Redux received a limited theatrical release in August of 2001 after a well-received screening at the Cannes Film Festival -- the same month that the film finally reached theaters in 1979 after a rough cut received a Golden Palm award at the Cannes Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0411</DIV><DIV class="tc">The return of director Terrence Malick to feature filmmaking after a twenty year sabbatical this World War II drama is an elegiac rumination on man's destruction of nature and himself based on James Jones' semi-autobiographical novel his follow-up to From Here to Eternity. James Caviezel stars as Private Witt a deserter living in peace and harmony with the natives of a Pacific island paradise. Captured by the Navy Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt goes ashore in the company of his fellow soldiers they meet diverse fates. Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson) is killed by an exploding grenade. Captain John Gaff (John Cusack) is an intelligent sober leader facing the destruction of his command because his commanding officer Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) is bucking for a general's star. Sergeant McCron (John Savage) loses his mind. Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) gets a "Dear John" letter from his beloved wife. However as the U.S. troops advance up grassy slopes toward entrenched Japanese positions it is Witt's voiced-over ruminations on life death and nature that are the real heart and soul of The Thin Red Line (1998). Adrien Brody appears as Private Fife the major character of Jones' novel and the author's alter-ego although Fife has been relegated to a minor supporting role by Malick's filmed adaptation.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Rutger Hauer stars as Erik Lanshof an aristocratic Dutch student one of six carefree friends who don't care much for politics. When the Nazis invade Holland however the group is drawn inevitably into the conflict. While Alex (Derek de Lint) joins the German army the suave Gus (Jeroen Krabbe) becomes a resistance leader eventually escaping with Erik to England where they become pawns in a much larger underground movement to restore their country's Queen Wilhelmina (Andrea Domburg) to her rightful throne. Based on an autobiographical novel by Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema Soldaat van Oranje (1978) also features early work by another Dutch master who went on to success as a director of big budget Hollywood films cinematographer Jan De Bont.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

The first half of the film documents the lives of the young men in Australia detailing their personalities and beliefs. The second half of the movie chronicles the ill-fated and ill-planned battle where the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps is hopelessly outmatched by the enemy forces. Gallipoli was the recipient of eight prizes at the 1981 Australian Film Institute Awards.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Part two takes place in Nam as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines.

Lt. Col. Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) was the commander of a unit during Operation Desert Storm who mistakenly ordered the destruction of what he believed to be an enemy tank only to discover that it actually held U.S. soldiers including a close friend. Since then Serling has been an emotional wreck drinking heavily and allowing his marriage to teeter on the brink of collapse. As a means of redeeming himself Serling is given a new assignment by his superior Gen. Hershberg (Michael Moriarty). Capt. Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) was a helicopter pilot who died in battle during the Iraqi conflict and the White House has proposed that Walden be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Serling is asked to investigate Walden's actions on the field of battle but he quickly discovers that no two stories about her are quite the same; Ilario (Matt Damon) says Walden acted heroically and sacrificed herself to save the others in her company while Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillps) claims she was a coward who was attempting to surrender to enemy troops. Meanwhile reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) is hounding Serling trying to get the inside story on Walden and on Serling's own difficulties. Matt Damon lost 40 pounds to prepare for his role in Courage Under Fire which resulted in a potentially life-threatening illness for the young actor.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

What's needed says British general Bernard Law Montgomery is a knockout punch a bold strike through Holland where German troops are spread thin that will put the Allies into Germany. Paratroops led by British major general Robert Urquhart (Sean Connery) and American brigadier general James Gavin (Ryan O'Neal) will seize a thin road and five bridges through Holland into Germany with paratroops led by Lieutenant Col. John Frost (Sir Anthony Hopkins) holding the most critical bridge at a small town called Arnhem. Over this road shall pass combined forces led by British Lieutenant Gen. Brian Horrocks (Edward Fox) and British Lieutenant Col. Joe Vandeleur (Michael Caine). The plan requires precise timing so much so that one planner tells Lieutenant Gen. Frederick Browning (Dirk Bogarde) "Sir I think we may be going a bridge too far." The plan also has one critical flaw: Instead of a smattering of German soldiers the area around Arnhem is loaded with crack SS troops. Disaster ensues. Based on a book by historian Cornelius Ryan A Bridge Too Far is reminiscent of another movie based on a Ryan book The Longest Day. Like that movie it is loaded with more than 15 international stars including Sir Laurence Olivier Robert Redford Hardy Krueger Gene Hackman Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullman.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin a schlemiel's schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior in honor of Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks or rather commands: "Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!" Before long the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective a sadistic dentist and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile Mr. Mushnik who has stumbled onto Seymour's secret has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith who also wrote the script and supplied the plant's voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s. By the mid-1970s it had attained classic status spawning a big-budget Broadway musical (and followup feature film) in the 1980s and a Saturday morning cartoon series in the 1990s. Enhancing the original Little Shop's reputation was the brief appearance by star-in-the-making Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (Nicholson is often incorrectly referred to as the star of the film though in fact he barely receives billing). Much as we love Nicholson our vote for the most memorable Little Shop cast member goes to the ubiquitous Dick Miller ("No thanks I'll eat it here").</DIV><DIV class="tc">Horror</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0404</DIV><DIV class="tc">Das Boot is one of the most gripping and authentic war movies ever made. Based on an autobiographical novel by German World War II photographer Lothar-Guenther Buchheim the film follows the lives of a fearless U-Boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and his inexperienced crew as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean in search of Allied vessels taking turns as hunter and prey. There's very little plot so the movie's power comes from both its riveting epic battle scenes and its details of the boring hours spent waiting for orders or signs of the enemy. With the exception of one staunch Hitler Youth lieutenant none of the crew is particularly loyal to the Nazis and some are openly hostile toward their Fuhrer; this allows viewer sympathy with the men as they perform their laborious monotonous duties in cramped filthy quarters or await death as depth charges explode all around the sub. Prochnow is excellent as the nerves-of-steel commander and many of the supporting actors -- all German -- are solid as well although the characterizations border on war movie clichés (the young crewman who has left behind his pregnant girlfriend the Chief Engineer whose wife is seriously ill). The real star however is cinematographer Jost Vacano who makes the sub's grimy claustrophobic interior come to vivid life as his camera follows the crew through hatches up ladders into bunks and under pipes creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia while injecting it with movement. Originally edited by writer/director Wolfgang Petersen as both a two-and-a-half hour theatrical release and a six-hour German miniseries Das Boot was re-released in a restored version in 1997 with nearly one hour of added footage which made it even more suspenseful than before.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:32 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0405</DIV><DIV class="tc">The scene is Schofield Army Barracks in Honolulu in the languid days before the attack on Pearl Harbor where James Jones' acclaimed war novel From Here to Eternity brought the aspirations and frustrations of several people sharply into focus. Sergeant Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster) enters into an affair with Karen (Deborah Kerr) the wife of his commanding officer. Private Robert E. Lee "Prew" Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) is a loner who lives by his own code of ethics and communicates better with his bugle than he does with words. Prew's best friend is wisecracking Maggio (Frank Sinatra in an Oscar-winning performance that revived his flagging career) who has been targeted for persecution by sadistic stockade sergeant Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine). Rounding out the principals is Alma Lorene (Donna Reed) a "hostess" at the euphemistically named whorehouse The New Congress Club. All these melodramatic joys and sufferings are swept away by the Japanese attack on the morning of December 7. No words could do justice to the film's most famous scene: the nocturnal romantic rendezvous on the beach with Burt Lancaster's and Deborah Kerr's bodies intertwining as the waves crash over them. If you're able to take your eyes off the principals for a moment or two keep an eye out for George Reeves; his supporting role was shaved down when during previews audiences yelled "There's Superman!" and began to laugh. From Here to Eternity won eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay and supporting awards to Sinatra and Reed.</DIV><DIV class="tc">War</DIV></DIV>

True the film does star spaghetti Western star Lee Van Cleef as the tight-lipped hero of the title but it has a very different feel from the genre's traditional Sergio Leone-derived style. Director/co-writer Gianfranco Parolini (alias Frank Kramer) takes things in a direction that seems to fall halfway between The Wild Wild West TV series and a James Bond movie; the film is packed with colorful characters exotic weapons and the action scenes that mix wild stunts with pyrotechnics. Parolini appropriately gives the film a light touch playing up the colorful and humorous aspects while delivering the action. The end result is a little too long for this sort of light material causing it to drag a bit in the middle but it is too good-natured and entertaining to dislike. In short Sabata is likely to make fun viewing for Euro-cult fans and anyone interested in an offbeat Western.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Spaghetti Western</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">1105</DIV><DIV class="tc">Gods and Monsters was promoted from the outset as an artistic drama but the publicity tended to play coyly on the possibility of a homosexual romance between the retired film director James Whale played by Ian McKellen and his hunky gardener Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser). While the film does involve romance the central relationship between the director and his gardener is about the development of a genuine friendship between two outwardly dissimilar but inwardly kindred spirits. In the story Whale has been living for many years in peaceful if not entirely contented retirement under the loving and watchful eye of his contentious and argumentative Hungarian housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave). His earlier celebrity as the director of the original Frankenstein movie and its sequel The Bride of Frankenstein results in his being visited occasionally by disagreeable young men who have come to bask in the reminiscences of this creator of two "camp" classics. His reputation as a fairly outrageous homosexual comes into play here when one particularly unpleasant and effeminate young man comes by seeking cinematic tidbits: the director challenges the boy to a game of stripping off one article of clothing for every revelation he shares about his moviemaking past. He had gotten the boy down to his briefs when he is stricken with one of his ever-recurring bouts of epilepsy the result of a series of strokes. By way of contrast while he is clearly interested in his gardener as a sex-object gradually luring him into ever closer association the openness and vulnerability of this awkwardly aggressive heterosexual boy inspires him to reveal the history of his heart. It turns out that like the young man who is modeling for his supposed artworks he came from a poor and difficult background. By the time naïve gardener learns of the director's homosexuality from the housekeeper he has been drawn too deeply under the man's spell to stay away from their meetings for long. While the tension between the men never departs a genuine relationship of caring develops between them. Meanwhile Whale has been clearly observing the progressive deterioration of his mental faculties and is increasingly being overwhelmed by vivid memories and visions.</DIV><DIV class="tc">director</DIV></DIV>

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart his son is a junkie and his health is failing which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however the longer he plays the role of the gangster the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny Lefty's boss and Bruno Kirby as Nicky one of Sonny's henchmen. The real-life Joe Pistone today lives under an assumed name with a 500000-dollar contract on his life still in effect.</DIV><DIV class="tc">organized - crime</DIV></DIV>

Adapted by Karl Tunberg and a raft of uncredited writers including Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson the film once more recounts the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who lives in Judea with his family during the time that Jesus Christ was becoming known for his "radical" teachings. Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) is now an ambitious Roman tribune; when Ben-Hur refuses to help Messala round up local dissidents on behalf of the emperor Messala pounces on the first opportunity to exact revenge on his onetime friend. Tried on a trumped-up charge of attempting to kill the provincial governor (whose head was accidentally hit by a falling tile) Ben-Hur is condemned to the Roman galleys while his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) are imprisoned. But during a sea battle Ben-Hur saves the life of commander Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who in gratitude adopts Ben-Hur as his son and gives him full control over his stable of racing horses. Ben-Hur never gives up trying to find his family or exact revenge on Messala. At crucial junctures in his life he also crosses the path of Jesus and each time he benefits from it. The highlight of the film's 212 minutes is its now-legendary chariot race staged largely by stunt expert Yakima Canutt. Ben-Hur's Oscar haul included Best Picture Best Director for the legendary William Wyler Best Actor for Heston and Best Supporting Actor for Welsh actor Hugh Griffith as an Arab sheik.</DIV><DIV class="tc">revenge</DIV></DIV>

The semi-autobiographical story is based on the life of the director's mother. Lena (Isabelle Huppert) is a Jewish refugee from Belgium living in occupied France during WWII. In order to avoid being sent to a German concentration camp she agrees to marry the discharged military officer Michel (Guy Marchand). He tries to provide a decent life for her by running an auto repair business. They have two children together but Lena is unhappy and stifled by her domestic life. Michel doesn't offer her the sensitivity and affection that she requires. Meanwhile in Paris the extroverted artist Madeleine (Miou-Miou) mourns the accidental death of her husband. After the liberation of France she marries actor Costa (Jean-Pierre Bacri) and has children of her own. In 1952 Lena and Madeleine meet by chance in Lyons. The two women develop an emotional relationship that borders on romantic involvement. Their bond is only strengthened by a mutual dissatisfaction with their husbands children and home life in general. Entre Nous was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1983.</DIV><DIV class="tc">France</DIV></DIV>

Jeannette (Ariane Ascaride) is a single mother living in a working-class community in Marseilles; she tries to support herself and her two kids on her salary as a check-out girl at a supermarket and lives in an apartment complex where everyone is thrown into close proximity with everyone else (thankfully they all get along). Marius (Gerard Meylan) is working as a security guard at a cement factory that has gone out of business; he's also squatting in the building since the plant is soon to be demolished and he'll be needing his money later on. One day Jeannette happens by the factory and spotting several cans of paint tries to take two of them home with her. Marius spots her and tries to chase her away while she rails at him with curses against the capitalist system. The next day an apologetic Marius appears at her doorstep cans of paint in hand; the two soon become friendly and a romance begins to bloom though it quickly becomes obvious that Jeannette's romance novel fantasies about passionate embraces in the sunset are a bit off the mark from what the more pragmatic Marius has in mind. Ariane Ascaride won a Cesar Award (the French Oscar) for her performance in Marius Et Jeannette: Un Conte De L'Estaque; she's married to the film's director Robert Guediguian.</DIV><DIV class="tc">France</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">1398</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Ballad of Little Jo is based on a true story -- several true stories in fact. Suzy Amis plays demure young Josephine Monagan who in 1866 is run out of her home town after bearing an illegitimate child. Fleeing westward Josephine is terrified by stories of how treacherous the frontier can be for a woman alone. As a result upon arriving in the muddy burg of Ruby City she disguises herself as a man going so far as to scar her face to suggest that she's been in a few scrapes. In this guise "Little Jo" does just fine by herself for nearly 30 years! Almost as good as Suzy Amis is Bo Hopkins as gunslinger Frank Badger Little Jo's best buddy (if only he knew....) Written and directed by Maggie Greenwald The Ballad of Little Jo does a marvelous job conveying the people and places of its period; and unlike Bad Girls (which was released around the same time) we aren't bludgeoned to death by feminist revisionism. Unfortunately ignored when it went out to theatres in the fall of 1993 The Ballad of Little Jo has fared rather better on video.</DIV><DIV class="tc">disguise</DIV></DIV>

Presley plays a young buck who accidentally kills a man while protecting the honor of a woman. Thrown into prison Elvis strikes up a friendship with visionary fellow-con Mickey Shaughnessy. Shaughnessy suggests that Elvis perform in the upcoming prison show. Ol' swivel-hips scores a hit and decides to stay in showbiz after his release. Together with pretty Judy Tyler (the former Princess Summerfall Winterspring on Howdy Doody who would die in a horrible traffic accident shortly after completing this film) Elvis sets up his own record company. Alas success goes to his head and soon Elvis plans to ditch Tyler in favor of signing with a big-time label. Shaughnessy shows up long enough to punch out Elvis for his disloyalty; as a result Elvis' vocal chords are damaged and he is unable to sing. Deserted by his flunkeys and hangers-on Elvis learns the value of friendship and fidelity when Tyler and Shaughnessy stay by his side in his darkest hours. His voice restored Elvis climbs back up the charts--but this time he's a much nicer fellow and a lot more committed to Tyler. Usually the musical numbers in a Presley picture (this one has a doozy complete with chorus boys dressed as convicts!) are more compelling than the plot. Jailhouse Rock is a perfect balance of song and story from beginning to end; seldom would Elvis be so well showcased in the future.</DIV><DIV class="tc">convict</DIV></DIV>

John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships. Together with Quentin Tarantino's very different Pulp Fiction (1994) sex lies and videotape was one of the most influential movies for independent filmmaking of the 1990s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">husband</DIV></DIV>

Fergus (Stephen Rea) is an IRA "volunteer" who despite personal misgivings takes part in the kidnapping of a black British soldier Jody (Forest Whitaker) stationed in Northern Ireland. The IRA hopes to use Jody as a bargaining chip to win the release of IRA operatives behind bars but while guarding Jody Fergus becomes fast friends with his prisoner. Jody makes Fergus promise him that if he dies Fegus will look in on his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson) and see if she's all right. Jody escapes and Fergus doesn't have the heart to shoot him; as fate would have it Jody runs from the woods into a street only to be run over by a British police vehicle which then flushes out the IRA compound. Fergus escapes to London where he's wanted by the law for Jody's kidnapping and also by his former girlfriend IRA operative Jude (Miranda Richardson) who thinks he knows too much to fall into the hands of the British authorities. Good to his word Fergus tracks down Dil and soon the two outcasts find themselves entering into a love affair although Fergus discovers that Dil is not the sort of woman he thought she was. Writer/director Neil Jordan won an Academy Award for his screenplay; the title song which was a U.K. hit for Dave Berry in 1965 was re-recorded for the film by one-time Culture Club vocalist Boy George with backing by the Pet Shop Boys.</DIV><DIV class="tc">kidnap</DIV></DIV>

Marcello agrees to kill a political refugee on orders from the Fascist government even though the victim-to-be is his college mentor. The film is a character study of the kind of person who willingly "conforms" to the ideological fashions of his day. In this case director Bernardo Bertolucci suggests that Marcello's desire to conform is rooted in his latent homosexuality. In addition to its strong storyline the film is critically revered for the astonishing production design by Nedo Azzini which together with Vittorio Storaro's camerawork recreates the atmosphere of Fascist Italy with some of the most complex visual compositions ever seen on film filled with highly stylized uses of angles shapes and shadows. The Conformist was cut by five crucial minutes when first released in the US; those missing moments were restored in the 1994 reissue.</DIV><DIV class="tc">homosexual</DIV></DIV>

He finally returns to his home village to attend the funeral of the town's former film projectionist Alfredo and in so doing embarks upon a journey into his boyhood just after WWII when he became the man's official son. In the dark confines of the Cinema Paradiso the boy and the other townsfolk try to escape from the grim realities of post-war Italy. The town censor is also there to insure nothing untoward appears onscreen invariably demanding that all kissing scenes be edited out. One day Salvatore saves Alfredo's life after a fire and then becomes the new projectionist. A few years later Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful girl who breaks his heart after he is inducted into the military. Thirty years later Salvatore has come to say goodbye to his life-long friend who has left him a little gift in a film can.

The center of this ensemble film is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy Hamilton. She is a young innocent high-school student who as the film opens is asking for advice from her friend the sexually outspoken Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates). Stacy takes a liking to nebbish Mark Ratner (Brian Backer) but he is too afraid to make a move even after Stacy all but throws herself at him. She eventually hooks up with Mark's more confident best friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus). When not concerning itself with these four characters the film spends time with stoned surfer dude Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) and his ongoing feud with history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston).

That's the wish he makes at an odd-looking amusement pier fortunetelling machine. The next morning Josh wakes up-only to discover that he's grown to manhood overnight! (At this point the part is taken over by Tom Hanks). Still a 13-year-old mentally and emotionally Josh decides to hide out in New York City until he can figure out what to do next. He lucks into a job with a major toy company run by kid-at-heart McMillan (Robert Loggia). By cannily bringing a child's eye view to McMillan's business Josh rises to the top-and in process he falls in love with fellow employee Susan (Elizabeth Perkins). But he's still a kid and he'd like to go back to his own world and own body. Written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg Big proved a crucial success for budding director Penny Marshall who'd work harmoniously with Hanks again on the radically different A League of Their Own. The cinematography was by Barry Sonenfeld who went on to become a director himself with The Addams Family. That Big was heavily reliant upon the input of Tom Hanks and Penny Marshall was proven by the failed attempt to turn the property into a Broadway musical.</DIV><DIV class="tc">toy</DIV></DIV>

Marcello agrees to kill a political refugee on orders from the Fascist government even though the victim-to-be is his college mentor. The film is a character study of the kind of person who willingly "conforms" to the ideological fashions of his day. In this case director Bernardo Bertolucci suggests that Marcello's desire to conform is rooted in his latent homosexuality. In addition to its strong storyline the film is critically revered for the astonishing production design by Nedo Azzini which together with Vittorio Storaro's camerawork recreates the atmosphere of Fascist Italy with some of the most complex visual compositions ever seen on film filled with highly stylized uses of angles shapes and shadows. The Conformist was cut by five crucial minutes when first released in the US; those missing moments were restored in the 1994 reissue.</DIV><DIV class="tc">kill</DIV></DIV>

The story begins in the present as a Sicilian mother pines for her estranged son Salvatore who left many years ago and has since become a prominent Roman film director who has taken the advice of his mentor too literally. He finally returns to his home village to attend the funeral of the town's former film projectionist Alfredo and in so doing embarks upon a journey into his boyhood just after WWII when he became the man's official son. In the dark confines of the Cinema Paradiso the boy and the other townsfolk try to escape from the grim realities of post-war Italy. The town censor is also there to insure nothing untoward appears onscreen invariably demanding that all kissing scenes be edited out. One day Salvatore saves Alfredo's life after a fire and then becomes the new projectionist. A few years later Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful girl who breaks his heart after he is inducted into the military. Thirty years later Salvatore has come to say goodbye to his life-long friend who has left him a little gift in a film can. In 2002 over a decade after the film's original release Tornatore brought the original 170-minute director's cut to American screens for the first time.</DIV><DIV class="tc">projectionist</DIV></DIV>

Grant) is an unsuccessful pill-popping actor; "I" or Marwood (Paul McGann) is Withnail's roommate and another equally underemployed actor. The time is 1969: Withnail is fast becoming a burned-out relic of the '60s while Marwood is trying to reassimilate into society. The two take a trip to the country in hopes of rejuvenating themselves but things go from worse to even worse. Given the intimacy and insight of the screenplay and dialogue one shouldn't be surprised that Bruce Robinson (who adapted the film from his own novel) based Withnail &amp; I on his own experiences. The film proves that certain "Age of Aquarius" types were just as bollixed-up in Britain as they were in America.</DIV><DIV class="tc">roommate</DIV></DIV>

While travelling back to the United States by ship Alec discovers a wild beautiful Arabian stallion being brought along in the cargo hold. When disaster strikes at sea the ship sinks and Alec and the stallion are the only survivors. Alone together on a nearby island the boy and the horse develop a relationship; wary of each other at first they learn to trust each other and they become close friends. When a rescue party finally finds Alec he refuses to leave the island without the stallion and the horse goes with Alec to the small town that is his home. Alec's mother (Teri Garr) is at a loss about what to do with this remarkable but difficult animal. Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) an elderly horse trainer who lives in the neighborhood senses a special connection between the boy and his horse; he's soon convinced that with the right training and the boy as his jockey the horse could be a champion on the race course. First-time director Carroll Ballard captures the mysterious relationship between humans and animals treating the stallion with the same intelligence and respect as the rest of his cast; he also draws fine understated performances from Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney and Caleb Deschanel's photography makes this a feast for the eyes. The Black Stallion is that rare contemporary family film that will fascinate adults as much as their kids if not more so.</DIV><DIV class="tc">rescue</DIV></DIV>

Upon badgering her mother into giving her a 500-toman banknote Razieh heads off to the marketplace alone; it is her first real experience away from her parents' watchful eyes and the excitement and wonder she feels is palpable. Told in real time the film's sensitive portrayal of Razieh's wide-eyed misadventures superbly conveys the impact which an otherwise unremarkable chain of events can indelibly leave upon the life of a child. Her struggle to prove her independence is dramatically undercut when she loses the banknote not once but twice but her spirit and ingenuity nevertheless remain indefatigable.</DIV><DIV class="tc">girl</DIV></DIV>

Adapting a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett also the author of The Secret Garden the film shifts the story's setting to World War I. 10 year-old Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) has been left in a respected New York City boarding school while her British father heads overseas to fight. Filled with wild stories and a playful attitude the unconventional Sara becomes popular amongst her classmates but quickly comes into conflict with the harsh headmistress Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron) who attempts to quash the child's individuality. The young girl's situation takes a serious turn for the worse when she unexpectedly receives word of her father's death and suddenly impoverished is forced into life as a servant. Treated as a lesser class of person by her former companions Sara instead befriends her fellow servants and turns to the power of imagination in order to maintain hope for the future. In addition to changing the story's setting screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler add a layer of Indian mythology to the tale allowing director Alfonso Cuaron the chance to punctuate the riches-to-rags fable with a series of lush imaginative fantasy sequences. Though A Little Princess had difficulty attracting audiences during its initial run its visual splendor and touching storytelling were praised by many critics several of whom proclaimed the film one of the best family-oriented productions of its time.</DIV><DIV class="tc">imagination</DIV></DIV>

He is rescued by Japanese janitor Miyagi (Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita) who agrees to teach Daniel how to harness karate for good instead of brutality. The film culminates in a championship karate bout pitting Daniel against his sworn enemy Johnny (William Zabka) -- the cruel and thuggish boyfriend of Ali (Elisabeth Shue) with whom Daniel has fallen in love (and vice versa). Real-life karate champ Chuck Norris was offered the role of Kreese the sadistic coach who goads Johnny into fighting dirty but Norris turned down the role refusing to be shown utilizing his skills negatively onscreen. Vastly popular The Karate Kid spawned three sequels of rapidly descending merit as well as a Saturday-morning cartoon series.</DIV><DIV class="tc">karate</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0196</DIV><DIV class="tc">Director Bob Rafelson fulfilled a lifelong dream when he finally received backing to complete Mountains of the Moon. The film recreates the exploratory adventures of 19th century visionaries Sir Richard Burton (Patrick Bergin) and John Henning Speke (Iain Glen). The heart of the film is the effort by Burton and Speke to discover the true source of the Nile river. This occurs well into the film after several torturous scenes involving the injuries sustained by the protagonists during other expeditions and their growing friendship (which the film intimates goes far beyond friendship). Rafaelson's fascination with this story and his insistence upon painstaking historical accuracy unfortunately compromises his ability to make an interesting film. There are so many starts and stops during the first half that we sincerely hope Burton and Speke will chuck it all and set up a pub in Bristol or something. What saves Mountains of the Moon is the rapport between its stars and the brilliant epic-like cinematography of Roger Deakins.</DIV><DIV class="tc">river</DIV></DIV>

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart his son is a junkie and his health is failing which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however the longer he plays the role of the gangster the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny Lefty's boss and Bruno Kirby as Nicky one of Sonny's henchmen.

At the behest of Iron John-esque Lewis (Burt Reynolds) the less adventuresome Ed (Jon Voight) Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) agree to canoe down an uncharted section of the river before a dam project ruins the region. After warnings from the grimy impoverished locals and Drew's tuneful yet ominous "Dueling Banjos" encounter with a mute inbred boy the four men embark on their trip exulting in the beauty of nature and the initial thrill of the rapids. The next day however things begin to take a turn for the worse when Bobby and Ed decide to rest on shore after becoming separated from Lewis and Drew. Two rifle-wielding mountain men (Bill McKinney and Herbert \"Cowboy\" Coward) emerge from the woods tying up Ed while one of them rapes Bobby and makes him "squeal like a pig." Lewis and Drew rescue them but the attack irrevocably changes the tenor of the journey. As the river gets rougher and rougher the men come to nightmarish grips with what it means to survive outside the safety net of "civilization."</DIV><DIV class="tc">trip</DIV></DIV>

In 1926 as China teeters on the edge of political revolution in the midst of a civil war the USS San Pablo is ordered to patrol the Yangtze River to represent and protect American interests. While the San Pablo may be an American ship much of the labor is actually performed by Chinese locals willing to work for American money while stern but inexperienced commanding officer Captain Collins (Richard Crenna) frequently drills his charges unsure what else to do. A machinist's mate with just under a decade of navy service behind him Jake Holman (Steve McQueen) is assigned to the San Pablo and immediately makes enemies among the crew -- he prefers to do his own work rather than farm it out to others and the one Chinese man who works by his side Po Han (Mako) is treated as an apprentice rather than a servant. Holman also falls in love with an idealistic American missionary (Candice Bergen) while his shipmate Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) falls for a Chinese girl and - with marriage plans in mind - kidnaps her to prevent her from being auctioned off. As Holman's methods and attitudes continue to anger his comrades they find themselves increasingly at odds with the Chinese especially after Frenchy's girlfriend becomes pregnant and Po Han is captured by revolutionary forces and branded a traitor.</DIV><DIV class="tc">love</DIV></DIV>

Adapted by Karl Tunberg and a raft of uncredited writers including Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson the film once more recounts the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who lives in Judea with his family during the time that Jesus Christ was becoming known for his "radical" teachings. Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) is now an ambitious Roman tribune; when Ben-Hur refuses to help Messala round up local dissidents on behalf of the emperor Messala pounces on the first opportunity to exact revenge on his onetime friend. Tried on a trumped-up charge of attempting to kill the provincial governor (whose head was accidentally hit by a falling tile) Ben-Hur is condemned to the Roman galleys while his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) are imprisoned. But during a sea battle Ben-Hur saves the life of commander Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who in gratitude adopts Ben-Hur as his son and gives him full control over his stable of racing horses. Ben-Hur never gives up trying to find his family or exact revenge on Messala. At crucial junctures in his life he also crosses the path of Jesus and each time he benefits from it. The highlight of the film's 212 minutes is its now-legendary chariot race staged largely by stunt expert Yakima Canutt. Ben-Hur's Oscar haul included Best Picture Best Director for the legendary William Wyler Best Actor for Heston and Best Supporting Actor for Welsh actor Hugh Griffith as an Arab sheik.</DIV><DIV class="tc">mother</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0094</DIV><DIV class="tc">This beautifully mounted adaptation of Walter Farley's story for children tells the tale of Alec (Kelly Reno) a young boy touring the world with his adventurous salesman father (Hoyt Axton). While travelling back to the United States by ship Alec discovers a wild beautiful Arabian stallion being brought along in the cargo hold. When disaster strikes at sea the ship sinks and Alec and the stallion are the only survivors. Alone together on a nearby island the boy and the horse develop a relationship; wary of each other at first they learn to trust each other and they become close friends. When a rescue party finally finds Alec he refuses to leave the island without the stallion and the horse goes with Alec to the small town that is his home. Alec's mother (Teri Garr) is at a loss about what to do with this remarkable but difficult animal. Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) an elderly horse trainer who lives in the neighborhood senses a special connection between the boy and his horse; he's soon convinced that with the right training and the boy as his jockey the horse could be a champion on the race course. First-time director Carroll Ballard captures the mysterious relationship between humans and animals treating the stallion with the same intelligence and respect as the rest of his cast; he also draws fine understated performances from Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney and Caleb Deschanel's photography makes this a feast for the eyes. The Black Stallion is that rare contemporary family film that will fascinate adults as much as their kids if not more so.</DIV><DIV class="tc">training</DIV></DIV>

In 1926 as China teeters on the edge of political revolution in the midst of a civil war the USS San Pablo is ordered to patrol the Yangtze River to represent and protect American interests. While the San Pablo may be an American ship much of the labor is actually performed by Chinese locals willing to work for American money while stern but inexperienced commanding officer Captain Collins (Richard Crenna) frequently drills his charges unsure what else to do. A machinist's mate with just under a decade of navy service behind him Jake Holman (Steve McQueen) is assigned to the San Pablo and immediately makes enemies among the crew -- he prefers to do his own work rather than farm it out to others and the one Chinese man who works by his side Po Han (Mako) is treated as an apprentice rather than a servant. Holman also falls in love with an idealistic American missionary (Candice Bergen) while his shipmate Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) falls for a Chinese girl and - with marriage plans in mind - kidnaps her to prevent her from being auctioned off. As Holman's methods and attitudes continue to anger his comrades they find themselves increasingly at odds with the Chinese especially after Frenchy's girlfriend becomes pregnant and Po Han is captured by revolutionary forces and branded a traitor.</DIV><DIV class="tc">missionary</DIV></DIV>

Structured in five sections contrasting home and war the film opens in Clairton PA as Mike (Robert De Niro) Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stan (John Cazale in his last film) celebrate the wedding of their friend Steve (John Savage) and go on a final deer hunt before the men leave for Vietnam. Mike treats hunting as a test of skill lecturing Stan about the value of "one shot" deer slaying and brushing off Nick's urgings to appreciate nature's beauty. As Mike ruminates post-hunt the film cuts to the horror of Vietnam where the men are captured by Vietcong soldiers who force Mike and Nick to play Russian roulette for the V.C.'s amusement. Mike turns the game to his advantage so they can escape captivity but the men are permanently scarred by the episode. Steve loses his legs; Nick vanishes in the Saigon Russian roulette parlors. Mike returns alone to Clairton a changed man as he rejects the killing of the deer hunt and finds solace with Nick's old girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). Disgusted by the antics of his male cohorts at home Mike decides to bring Steve back from a veterans' hospital and he returns to Saigon to find Nick. As Saigon falls Mike discovers how far gone Nick is; the survivors gather in Clairton for a funeral breakfast singing an impromptu rendition of "God Bless America."</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vietcong</DIV></DIV>

Here he vies with Tom Kasansky (Val Kilmer) for the coveted "Top Gun" award. When not so occupied Mitchell carries on a romance with civilian consultant Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). Shaken up by the death of a friend Mitchell loses the Top Gun honor to Kasansky. Worried that he may have lost his nerve Mitchell is given a chance to redeem himself during a tense international crisis involving a crippled US vessel and a flock of predatory enemy planes. The story wasn't new in 1986 but Top Gun scored with audiences on the strength of its visuals especially the vertigo-inducing aerial sequences. The film made more money than any other film in 1986 and even spawned a 1989 takeoff Hot Shots. An Academy Award went to the Giogio Moroder-Tom Whitlock song "Take My Breath Away."</DIV><DIV class="tc">training</DIV></DIV>

The most outwardly upscale member of the gang Jules (Demi Moore) hides a plethora of emotional baggage behind a chic wardrobe an expensive apartment a fashionable drug habit and lots of meaningless casual sex. Her friend Wendy (Mare Winningham) has the opposite problem; a trust-fund baby with body-image issues and little sexual experience she's hung up on Billy (Rob Lowe) a no-good sax-playing drunkard who can't face up to his responsibilities in the job market or at home with his wife and young child. Such open infidelity is anathema to Alex (Judd Nelson) who must maintain a sense of propriety even while engaging in compulsive womanizing; after all the Democrat-turned-Republican's nascent political career requires the sort of picture-perfect relationship he shares with girlfriend Leslie (Ally Sheedy). That doesn't sit too well with tortured writer Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) who toils away at a newspaper job and pines away for the unattainable Leslie. Unrequited love also dogs Kirby (Emilio Estevez) a law-school student whose greatest wish is to romance classy doctor Dale Biberman (Andie MacDowell) who is alas way out of his league. Co-written by director Joel Schumacher and his studio intern Carl Kurlander St. Elmo's Fire spawned the number one pop hit "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)" which was credited to John Parr but co-written by music producer David Foster.</DIV><DIV class="tc">coming - of - age</DIV></DIV>

The center of this ensemble film is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy Hamilton. She is a young innocent high-school student who as the film opens is asking for advice from her friend the sexually outspoken Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates). Stacy takes a liking to nebbish Mark Ratner (Brian Backer) but he is too afraid to make a move even after Stacy all but throws herself at him. She eventually hooks up with Mark's more confident best friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus). When not concerning itself with these four characters the film spends time with stoned surfer dude Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) and his ongoing feud with history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston).

Kermit the Frog has just put together a successful variety show at Danhurst college (probably somewhere between Amherst and Dartmouth) and although he would like to mount it on Broadway so he would have a hit and be able to marry Miss Piggy he cannot find backers. The Muppets are then forced to take jobs to support themselves and it is while working as a waiter that Kermit meets the friendly Jennie (Juliana Donald). Jennie is the daughter of the owner of the restaurant and a source of great jealousy for Miss Piggy who does not like competition. With stunning musical numbers involving a hundred or so Muppets and on-scene locations in New York City the film is impressive in its merging of technical achievements and acting.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Muppets</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0149</DIV><DIV class="tc">Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington) respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner SC charging a fortification manned by some 1000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording.</DIV><DIV class="tc">soldier</DIV></DIV>

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart his son is a junkie and his health is failing which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however the longer he plays the role of the gangster the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family.

Both sisters have already had brushes with death: Ullman has had an affair which prompted her husband's suicide while Thulin has long wanted to do away with herself at one point mutilating her own vagina out of self-hatred. As for Andersson she has been in pain so long that she feels as though she's in the midst of death-in-life. With her two sisters wrapped up in their own problems Harriet turns to her housekeeper Kari Sylwan for comfort; Sylwan has herself suffered the death of a child and has developed a philosophical attitude towards impending doom. One of the most influential moments of the film -- when two of the sisters share the innermost thoughts that they'd kept from one another for so many years -- is filmed without benefit of dialogue with the music of Chopin (enhanced by cinematographer Sven Nykvist's carefully selected camera angles) "speaking" for the ladies.

Among them are Steve (Ron Howard) and Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) college-bound with mixed feelings about leaving home; nerdy Terry "The Toad" (Charles Martin Smith) who scores a dream date with blonde Debbie (Candy Clark); and John (Paul Le Mat ) a 22-year-old drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with 13-year-old Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) in his deuce coupe. As D. J. Wolfman Jack spins 41 vintage tunes on the radio throughout the night Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) Curt chases a mystery blonde Terry tries to act cool and Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) but nothing can stop the next day from coming and with it the vastly different future ushered in by the 1960s. Fresh off The Godfather (1972) producer Francis Ford Coppola had the clout to get his friend George Lucas's project made but only for $750000 on a 28-day shooting schedule. Despite technical obstacles and having to shoot at night cinematographer Haskell Wexler gave the film the neon-lit aura that Lucas wanted evoking the authentic look of a suburban strip to go with the authentic sound of rock-n-roll. Universal which wanted to call the film Another Slow Night in Modesto thought it was unreleasable. But Lucas' period detail co-writers Willard Huyck's and Gloria Katz's realistic dialogue and the film's nostalgia for the pre-Vietnam years apparently appealed to a 1973 audience embroiled in cultural chaos: American Graffiti became the third most popular movie of 1973 (after The Exorcist and The Sting) establishing the reputations of Lucas (whose next film would be Star Wars) and his young cast and furthering the onset of soundtrack-driven youth-oriented movies. Although the film helped spark 1970s nostalgia for the 1950s nothing else would capture the flavor of the era with the same humorous candor and latent sense of foreboding.</DIV><DIV class="tc">teenagers</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0063</DIV><DIV class="tc">This acclaimed British comedy centers on the intermittent romance between a charming (if slightly bumbling) Englishman and a beautiful American woman who seem to always run into each other at weddings. Indeed it is at the first of the title's four weddings that Charles (Hugh Grant) and Carrie (Andie McDowell) meet enjoying a brief but fleeting connection. The spark is rekindled several months later when they unexpectedly meet at another wedding. Unfortunately however Carrie has become engaged to another a fact that complicates matters for them both. The story may seem simple but the film is elevated by screenwriter Richard Curtis' ear for witty dialogue and a colorful supporting cast. Director Mike Newell's sympathetic attention to character keeps the proceedings believable and prevents the film's more serious moments from seeming mawkish. These elements along with Grant's star-making performance as Charles helped the film achieve unexpected international success including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.</DIV><DIV class="tc">romance</DIV></DIV>

During the Depression Natty's father (Ray Wise) takes a job in a Northwestern lumber camp leaving his daughter behind in Chicago with the promise that he'll send for her when he's put together enough money. Unwilling to wait that long Natty runs away from her guardian (Lainie Kazan) and hops a freight bound for her dad's camp. In addition to the human friends she accrues along the way including vagabond John Cusack and tough-but-nice juvenile delinquent Barry Miller Natty is protected on her journey by a friendly wolf (actually a dog but you try training a wolf).

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart his son is a junkie and his health is failing which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however the longer he plays the role of the gangster the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny Lefty's boss and Bruno Kirby as Nicky one of Sonny's henchmen. The real-life Joe Pistone today lives under an assumed name with a 500000-dollar contract on his life still in effect.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Mafia</DIV></DIV>

Adapted by Karl Tunberg and a raft of uncredited writers including Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson the film once more recounts the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who lives in Judea with his family during the time that Jesus Christ was becoming known for his "radical" teachings. Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) is now an ambitious Roman tribune; when Ben-Hur refuses to help Messala round up local dissidents on behalf of the emperor Messala pounces on the first opportunity to exact revenge on his onetime friend. Tried on a trumped-up charge of attempting to kill the provincial governor (whose head was accidentally hit by a falling tile) Ben-Hur is condemned to the Roman galleys while his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) are imprisoned. But during a sea battle Ben-Hur saves the life of commander Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who in gratitude adopts Ben-Hur as his son and gives him full control over his stable of racing horses. Ben-Hur never gives up trying to find his family or exact revenge on Messala. At crucial junctures in his life he also crosses the path of Jesus and each time he benefits from it. The highlight of the film's 212 minutes is its now-legendary chariot race staged largely by stunt expert Yakima Canutt. Ben-Hur's Oscar haul included Best Picture Best Director for the legendary William Wyler Best Actor for Heston and Best Supporting Actor for Welsh actor Hugh Griffith as an Arab sheik.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Roman</DIV></DIV>

A predecessor of the well-paced character-driven films in Sayles' future Secaucus Seven also looks ahead to the 1980s ensemble movies that it inspired most notably Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill which arrived in theaters three years later. As each friend arrives at the house (or travels to the house) characterizations build dialogue expands and the house (and film) are full of people getting reacquainted and re-examining themselves and each other. Sayles builds the plot by testing the characters' connections: Will these former radicals accept the uptight boyfriend of the well-loved politico? What happens when a couple splits up? How does the educated set treat the local blue-collars? Many critics cited Secaucus Seven in their decade-end list of the best films of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">weekend</DIV></DIV>

Saxophonist Dexter Gordon portrays Dale Turner a fictional musician inspired by a number of famed jazz figures including Bud Powell and Lester Young. Largely forgotten in his home country Turner has moved to Paris in search of a more appreciative audience. He finds it in the form of Francis Borler (Francois Cluzet) a bebop aficionado who befriends the expatriate player. Borler soon becomes familiar with Turner's darker side including his struggles with alcoholism drug addiction and depression. Fearing for the musician's life the fan becomes his caretaker an arrangement that leads to a brief improvement in Turner's health and fortunes but places great emotional strain upon them both. Director Bertrand Tavernier pays great attention to the visual and aural details of the jazz world with outstanding musical supervision provided by Herbie Hancock. 'Round Midnight's greatest asset however is Gordon's Academy Award-nominated performance informed by his own life experiences. His naturally fascinating presence combines with the film's obvious love of the music and its milieu to provide what many have hailed as one of the more authentic and affectionate presentations of the jazz world on the silver screen.</DIV><DIV class="tc">love</DIV></DIV>

Arthur Parker (Steve Martin) is a sheet music salesman who believes that he can spot a hit a mile away and wants to open his own store. But he can't get a bank loan and his wife Joan (Jessica Harper) who has savings left to her by her father refuses to give him the money. Also while Arthur has a fierce sexual appetite Joan generally refuses his advances. While on the road Arthur meets Eileen (Bernadette Peters) a shy schoolteacher as desperate for affection as Arthur is hungry for sex. They begin an affair which leads to tragedy for both. Punctuating the drama of Pennies from Heaven are elaborate musical numbers in which the characters lip-synch to popular songs of the day which at once lift their hopes and reflect their fears. Arthur's buoyant tap number to "My Baby Said Yes" and Eileen's saucy rendition of "Love is Good for Anything That Ails You" are reflections of their needs for money and love and their pas de deux on "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is at once an escape and an acknowledgement of their hopelessness.</DIV><DIV class="tc">teacher</DIV></DIV>

Young Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger); at war's end Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier (Patrick Magee). Instead Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) however despises the upstart Barry and regardless of how his mother may feel sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy. Coming after Kubrick's esteemed hits 2001 (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) Barry Lyndon opened with high expectations and met with decidedly mixed responses to its restrained tone. Even with Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director (and wins for Cinematography Art Direction Costumes and Adapted Score) Barry Lyndon was a box office failure as mid-'70s audiences increasingly turned away from such narrative challenges as its epic length and muffled emotions. Since then Barry Lyndon has gained in stature taking its place among the formidable artistic achievements of Kubrick's career.</DIV><DIV class="tc">18th century</DIV></DIV>

Adapting a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett also the author of The Secret Garden the film shifts the story's setting to World War I. 10 year-old Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) has been left in a respected New York City boarding school while her British father heads overseas to fight. Filled with wild stories and a playful attitude the unconventional Sara becomes popular amongst her classmates but quickly comes into conflict with the harsh headmistress Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron) who attempts to quash the child's individuality. The young girl's situation takes a serious turn for the worse when she unexpectedly receives word of her father's death and suddenly impoverished is forced into life as a servant. Treated as a lesser class of person by her former companions Sara instead befriends her fellow servants and turns to the power of imagination in order to maintain hope for the future. In addition to changing the story's setting screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler add a layer of Indian mythology to the tale allowing director Alfonso Cuaron the chance to punctuate the riches-to-rags fable with a series of lush imaginative fantasy sequences. Though A Little Princess had difficulty attracting audiences during its initial run its visual splendor and touching storytelling were praised by many critics several of whom proclaimed the film one of the best family-oriented productions of its time.</DIV><DIV class="tc">World War I</DIV></DIV>

A young couple goes on a Midwest crime spree in Terrence Malick's hypnotically assured debut feature based on the 1950s Starkweather-Fugate murders. Fancying himself a rebel like James Dean twentysomething Kit (Martin Sheen) takes off with teen baton-twirler Holly (Sissy Spacek) after shooting her father (Warren Oates) when he tries to split the pair up. Once bounty hunters discover their riverside hiding place Kit and Holly head toward Saskatchewan leaving dead bodies in their wake. As the law closes in however Holly gives herself up -- but Kit doesn't hold it against her as he basks in his new status as a momentary folk hero. Inaugurating the use of voice-over narration that he would continue in Days of Heaven (1978) and The Thin Red Line (1998) Malick juxtaposes Holly's flat readings of her flowery romance-novel diary prose with the banal and surreal details of their journey. Singularly inarticulate with each other Kit and Holly are more intrigued by mythic celebrity gestures as Holly peruses her fan magazines and Kit commemorates key moments before orchestrating a properly dramatic capture for himself (complete with the right hat). The sublime visuals lend a dreamlike beauty to the couple's trip even as their actions are treated casually; Malick neither glamorizes Kit and Holly nor consigns them to the bloody end of their fame-fixated predecessors in Bonnie and Clyde (1967). With the couple's opaque dialogue and Holly's fanzine dream narration Malick further denies an easy explanation for their crimes. Made for under 500000 dollars Badlands debuted at the 1973 New York Film Festival along with Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and was released within months of two other outlaw-couple road movies Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express and Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us. Although Badlands did not make an impression at the box office its pictorial splendor and cool yet disquieting narrative established Malick as one of the most compelling artists to come out of early-'70s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1950s</DIV></DIV>

Lili Smith (Andrews) is a popular British music hall singer who is regarded as a femme fatale and has been known to throw a bit of striptease into her act. However Lili has a secret: she's actually a German spy and the uncle she dotes upon is really Von Ruger (Jeremy Kemp) a fellow espionage agent and her contact for the Huns. In hopes of gaining valuable information Lili begins using her feminine wiles on Maj. William Larrabee (Rock Hudson) a top American pilot. However Lili soon discovers that she's falling in love with Larrabee and can't find the courage to betray him; Larrabee discovers Lili's secret but he refuses to turn her in. Darling Lili was a notorious box-office disappointment grossing a mere $5 million on a budget that rose to $25 million due to a variety of production mishaps. Director Blake Edwards (Andrews' husband) was stung by the poor reception and he later trimmed the 136-minute film to 114 minutes downplaying its comic elements in favor of a more serious tone.</DIV><DIV class="tc">World War I</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0404</DIV><DIV class="tc">Das Boot is one of the most gripping and authentic war movies ever made. Based on an autobiographical novel by German World War II photographer Lothar-Guenther Buchheim the film follows the lives of a fearless U-Boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and his inexperienced crew as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean in search of Allied vessels taking turns as hunter and prey. There's very little plot so the movie's power comes from both its riveting epic battle scenes and its details of the boring hours spent waiting for orders or signs of the enemy. With the exception of one staunch Hitler Youth lieutenant none of the crew is particularly loyal to the Nazis and some are openly hostile toward their Fuhrer; this allows viewer sympathy with the men as they perform their laborious monotonous duties in cramped filthy quarters or await death as depth charges explode all around the sub. Prochnow is excellent as the nerves-of-steel commander and many of the supporting actors -- all German -- are solid as well although the characterizations border on war movie clichés (the young crewman who has left behind his pregnant girlfriend the Chief Engineer whose wife is seriously ill). The real star however is cinematographer Jost Vacano who makes the sub's grimy claustrophobic interior come to vivid life as his camera follows the crew through hatches up ladders into bunks and under pipes creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia while injecting it with movement. Originally edited by writer/director Wolfgang Petersen as both a two-and-a-half hour theatrical release and a six-hour German miniseries Das Boot was re-released in a restored version in 1997 with nearly one hour of added footage which made it even more suspenseful than before.</DIV><DIV class="tc">World War II</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:33 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0405</DIV><DIV class="tc">The scene is Schofield Army Barracks in Honolulu in the languid days before the attack on Pearl Harbor where James Jones' acclaimed war novel From Here to Eternity brought the aspirations and frustrations of several people sharply into focus. Sergeant Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster) enters into an affair with Karen (Deborah Kerr) the wife of his commanding officer. Private Robert E. Lee "Prew" Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) is a loner who lives by his own code of ethics and communicates better with his bugle than he does with words. Prew's best friend is wisecracking Maggio (Frank Sinatra in an Oscar-winning performance that revived his flagging career) who has been targeted for persecution by sadistic stockade sergeant Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine). Rounding out the principals is Alma Lorene (Donna Reed) a "hostess" at the euphemistically named whorehouse The New Congress Club. All these melodramatic joys and sufferings are swept away by the Japanese attack on the morning of December 7. No words could do justice to the film's most famous scene: the nocturnal romantic rendezvous on the beach with Burt Lancaster's and Deborah Kerr's bodies intertwining as the waves crash over them. If you're able to take your eyes off the principals for a moment or two keep an eye out for George Reeves; his supporting role was shaved down when during previews audiences yelled "There's Superman!" and began to laugh. From Here to Eternity won eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay and supporting awards to Sinatra and Reed.</DIV><DIV class="tc">war</DIV></DIV>

The similarities to the original end there as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them they recruit nine other men each with his own criminal specialty to assist in the mission: moneyman Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) card dealer Frank (Bernie Mac) pickpocket Linus (Matt Damon) aging con artist Saul (Carl Reiner) British explosives pro Basher (Don Cheadle) techie Dell (Eddie Jemison) rude-boy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) and professional acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin). What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts). Ocean's Eleven was updated by scribe Ted Griffin and marked the third feature shot by director Steven Soderbergh under the alias Peter Andrews.</DIV><DIV class="tc">casino</DIV></DIV>

But Coppola's troubles didn't end when he got his footage into the editing room and he tinkered with a number of different structures and endings before settling on the film's 153-minute final cut in time for its initial theatrical release in 1979. Twenty-two years later Francis Coppola returned to the material and created Apocalypse Now Redux an expanded and re-edited version of the film that adds 53 minutes of footage excised from the film's original release. In addition to adding a number of smaller moments that even out the film's rhythms Apocalypse Now Redux restores two much-discussed sequences that Coppola chose not to include in his original edition of the film -- an encounter in the jungle between Willard (Martin Sheen) his crewmates Chief (Albert Hall) Clean (Larry Fishburne) Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) and a trio of stranded Playboy models on a U.S.O. tour as well as a stopover at a plantation operated by French colonists De Marais (Christian Marquand) and Roxanne (Aurore Clement). Apocalypse Now Redux received a limited theatrical release in August of 2001 after a well-received screening at the Cannes Film Festival -- the same month that the film finally reached theaters in 1979 after a rough cut received a Golden Palm award at the Cannes Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vietnam</DIV></DIV>

In 1991 as the Gulf War winds to a close three American servicemen find themselves happy to have achieved victory but wondering about the ultimate importance of what they've done (especially since Saddam Hussein is still in power). Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is a decorated Vietnam veteran and special forces officer with two weeks to go before he retires; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) has a new baby at home; and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) is probably just going to end up back in Detroit. So when one of them comes across a map that seems to point out where Saddam's forces have stashed a large cache of gold they stole from Kuwait they decide to follow the trail and take some of the war booty for themselves. However the deeper they journey into Iraq the more they see of the consequences of America's policies in the Middle East. Although President George Bush and the American military urged Iraqi citizens to rise up against Saddam Hussein and pledged their support to a people's movement against the leader Iraqis found that when they took to the streets against Saddam the United States did not back them up and the loss of Iraqi lives was fearsome. When Gates Barlow and Elgin become aware of what's happening they're torn between their desire to grab the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the people they came to liberate. Three Kings was directed by David O. Russell and marked a significant change of direction after his dark-humored relationship comedies Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Iraq</DIV></DIV>

Captured by the Navy Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal.

In 1925 a band of adventurers seeking fame and fortune - led by Rick O'Connel (Brendan Fraser) an American expatriate who has joined the foreign legion and Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz) an amateur archeologist - find a previously unknown burial site in Egypt. The team starts to dig hoping to find lost riches but instead they disturb the tomb of Imhotep and soon the cursed priest rises from his grave to wreck vengeance on humanity.

The similarities to the original end there as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos.

What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts). Ocean's Eleven was updated by scribe Ted Griffin and marked the third feature shot by director Steven Soderbergh under the alias Peter Andrews.</DIV><DIV class="tc">casino</DIV></DIV>

But Coppola's troubles didn't end when he got his footage into the editing room and he tinkered with a number of different structures and endings before settling on the film's 153-minute final cut in time for its initial theatrical release in 1979. Twenty-two years later Francis Coppola returned to the material and created Apocalypse Now Redux an expanded and re-edited version of the film that adds 53 minutes of footage excised from the film's original release. In addition to adding a number of smaller moments that even out the film's rhythms Apocalypse Now Redux restores two much-discussed sequences that Coppola chose not to include in his original edition of the film -- an encounter in the jungle between Willard (Martin Sheen) his crewmates Chief (Albert Hall) Clean (Larry Fishburne) Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) and a trio of stranded Playboy models on a U.S.O. tour as well as a stopover at a plantation operated by French colonists De Marais (Christian Marquand) and Roxanne (Aurore Clement). Apocalypse Now Redux received a limited theatrical release in August of 2001 after a well-received screening at the Cannes Film Festival -- the same month that the film finally reached theaters in 1979 after a rough cut received a Golden Palm award at the Cannes Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vietnam</DIV></DIV>

In 1991 as the Gulf War winds to a close three American servicemen find themselves happy to have achieved victory but wondering about the ultimate importance of what they've done (especially since Saddam Hussein is still in power). Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is a decorated Vietnam veteran and special forces officer with two weeks to go before he retires; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) has a new baby at home; and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) is probably just going to end up back in Detroit. So when one of them comes across a map that seems to point out where Saddam's forces have stashed a large cache of gold they stole from Kuwait they decide to follow the trail and take some of the war booty for themselves. However the deeper they journey into Iraq the more they see of the consequences of America's policies in the Middle East. Although President George Bush and the American military urged Iraqi citizens to rise up against Saddam Hussein and pledged their support to a people's movement against the leader Iraqis found that when they took to the streets against Saddam the United States did not back them up and the loss of Iraqi lives was fearsome. When Gates Barlow and Elgin become aware of what's happening they're torn between their desire to grab the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the people they came to liberate.

Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a popular and well-respected instructor at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha Nebraska but lately he's been unhappy in both his personal and professional life and his anxieties finally come to a head with the school's student elections. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is running for student body president and she certainly seems like the sort of girl who would win a high school election -- she's pretty popular and takes part in all the right extra-curricular activities. In fact she seems so perfect she's running unopposed which offends McAllister's sense of democracy (not to mention the fact he doesn't like her very much). So Jim intervenes and persuades Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against Tracy. Paul is not terribly bright and is entirely unqualified to be student president but as a star of the school's football team (before a leg injury sidelined him) he's popular enough to at least give Tracy a run for her money. Just as the race begins to heat up a spanner is truly thrown into the works when Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) announces she's also running for office. Publicly Tammy's platform is that the student elections are ultimately pointless and if she's elected she'll eliminate them altogether.

In 1917 there is little to be happy about in the Wright household in West Yorkshire England. Polly (Phoebe Nicholls) and her 12-year-old daughter Elsie (Florence Hoath) are still grieving over the death of Elsie's younger brother and Polly's niece Frances (Elizabeth Earl) has come to stay with them after her father was declared missing in action during World War I. Polly longs for some sort of proof that there is a life beyond our own while the two girls ardently believe in fairies and enthusiastically study legend and lore. One day Elsie and Frances produce photographs of fairies that they claim were playing in their garden; Polly believes that they are real and soon the snapshots attract international attention. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and a confirmed spiritualist declares the photos "as genuine as the King's beard" while illusionist Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) who has devoted much time and energy to exposing phony mediums and psychics takes a more skeptical view. While Fairy Tale: A True Story presents the appearance of the fairies as fact analysis of the photographs proved them to be fakes (especially after the same fairies were discovered as illustrations in a children's book published before the photos were taken). The real-life Elsie Wright admitted late in life that the fairy photos were a hoax performed as a "little joke" and that she was always surprised that so many people believed them.</DIV><DIV class="tc">World War I</DIV></DIV>

Isabelle Adjani stars as Marguerite de Valois better known as Margot daughter of scheming Catholic power player Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi). Margot is an heiress to the throne during the late 16th century reign of the neurotic hypochondriac King Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade) a time when Protestants and Catholics are vying for political control of France. Catherine decides to make an overture of good will by offering up Margot in marriage to prominent Protestant Huguenot Henri of Navarre (Daniel Auteuil) although she also schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572 when tens of thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot doesn't love Henri and takes a lover the soldier La Mole (Vincent Perez) also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow as court intrigues multiply and Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son Anjou (Pascal Greggory) on the throne threatens the lives of La Mole Margot and Henri.

In 1917 there is little to be happy about in the Wright household in West Yorkshire England. Polly (Phoebe Nicholls) and her 12-year-old daughter Elsie (Florence Hoath) are still grieving over the death of Elsie's younger brother and Polly's niece Frances (Elizabeth Earl) has come to stay with them after her father was declared missing in action during World War I. Polly longs for some sort of proof that there is a life beyond our own while the two girls ardently believe in fairies and enthusiastically study legend and lore. One day Elsie and Frances produce photographs of fairies that they claim were playing in their garden; Polly believes that they are real and soon the snapshots attract international attention. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and a confirmed spiritualist declares the photos "as genuine as the King's beard" while illusionist Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) who has devoted much time and energy to exposing phony mediums and psychics takes a more skeptical view. While Fairy Tale: A True Story presents the appearance of the fairies as fact analysis of the photographs proved them to be fakes (especially after the same fairies were discovered as illustrations in a children's book published before the photos were taken). The real-life Elsie Wright admitted late in life that the fairy photos were a hoax performed as a "little joke" and that she was always surprised that so many people believed them.</DIV><DIV class="tc">World War I</DIV></DIV>

The marriage goes forward but Margot doesn't love Henri and takes a lover the soldier La Mole (Vincent Perez) also a Protestant from a well-to-do family.

As with its predecessor Ocean's Eleven opens with its titular hero Danny Ocean (George Clooney stepping into the Frank Sinatra role) eager for a new challenge. The similarities to the original end there as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them they recruit nine other men each with his own criminal specialty to assist in the mission: moneyman Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) card dealer Frank (Bernie Mac) pickpocket Linus (Matt Damon) aging con artist Saul (Carl Reiner) British explosives pro Basher (Don Cheadle) techie Dell (Eddie Jemison) rude-boy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) and professional acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin). What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts). Ocean's Eleven was updated by scribe Ted Griffin and marked the third feature shot by director Steven Soderbergh under the alias Peter Andrews.</DIV><DIV class="tc">casino</DIV></DIV>

But Coppola's troubles didn't end when he got his footage into the editing room and he tinkered with a number of different structures and endings before settling on the film's 153-minute final cut in time for its initial theatrical release in 1979. Twenty-two years later Francis Coppola returned to the material and created Apocalypse Now Redux an expanded and re-edited version of the film that adds 53 minutes of footage excised from the film's original release. In addition to adding a number of smaller moments that even out the film's rhythms Apocalypse Now Redux restores two much-discussed sequences that Coppola chose not to include in his original edition of the film -- an encounter in the jungle between Willard (Martin Sheen) his crewmates Chief (Albert Hall) Clean (Larry Fishburne) Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) and a trio of stranded Playboy models on a U.S.O. tour as well as a stopover at a plantation operated by French colonists De Marais (Christian Marquand) and Roxanne (Aurore Clement). Apocalypse Now Redux received a limited theatrical release in August of 2001 after a well-received screening at the Cannes Film Festival -- the same month that the film finally reached theaters in 1979 after a rough cut received a Golden Palm award at the Cannes Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vietnam</DIV></DIV>

In 1991 as the Gulf War winds to a close three American servicemen find themselves happy to have achieved victory but wondering about the ultimate importance of what they've done (especially since Saddam Hussein is still in power). Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is a decorated Vietnam veteran and special forces officer with two weeks to go before he retires; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) has a new baby at home; and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) is probably just going to end up back in Detroit. So when one of them comes across a map that seems to point out where Saddam's forces have stashed a large cache of gold they stole from Kuwait they decide to follow the trail and take some of the war booty for themselves. However the deeper they journey into Iraq the more they see of the consequences of America's policies in the Middle East. Although President George Bush and the American military urged Iraqi citizens to rise up against Saddam Hussein and pledged their support to a people's movement against the leader Iraqis found that when they took to the streets against Saddam the United States did not back them up and the loss of Iraqi lives was fearsome. When Gates Barlow and Elgin become aware of what's happening they're torn between their desire to grab the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the people they came to liberate. Three Kings was directed by David O. Russell and marked a significant change of direction after his dark-humored relationship comedies Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Iraq</DIV></DIV>

Though the film was the topic of great political controversy in China upon its release it received armfuls of awards from Belgium Italy the United Kingdom and a nomination for an Academy Award. This sumptuously photographed drama set in Northern China in the 1920s and based on the novel Wives and Concubines by Su Tong stars Gong Li as Songlian the fourth wife of an elderly landlord. Songlian is a college student who has been married off by her stepmother so it is with tremendous frustration that this woman who had hopes of using her education to broaden her horizons now finds herself reduced to a small enclosure at the beck and call of her husband. Despite being given a maid (Kong Lin) and luxurious surroundings she feels trapped inside the cheerless walls. Upon her arrival Songlian realizes that she must keep one step ahead of her rivals the three other wives. She also learns of her husband's tradition of lighting a lantern outside of the house of the wife with whom he intends to spend the night. During the first night together with her husband she finds he is called away to tend to his spoiled third wife (He Caifei). Songlian then becomes acquainted with his other wives -- his first wife (Jin Shuyuan) an elderly woman who ignores Songlian; the third wife an ex-opera singer; and the second wife (Cao Cuifeng) who offers Songlian friendship and helpful advice. But it turns out that the second wife's motives are not exactly innocent--she is conspiring with Songlian's maid to undermine both the third wife and Songlian. Raise the Red Lantern is a moving exploration of power in a suffocating world of ossified tradition and naked ambition-a masterpiece of 1990s world cinema.</DIV><DIV class="tc">China</DIV></DIV>

Wong Fei Hong (Chan) is a young master of the martial art of "drunken boxing" in which fighters use alcohol to blind themselves to pain and release the angry brawler within; with the right amount of drinks under his belt Hong can become a furious one-man army. Hong accompanies his father (Ti Lung) on a voyage to China where they purchase a precious supply of ginseng. When Hong discovers thugs stealing from their luggage he leaps into action to get their belongings back.

Hong sets out to fight the gangsters and give the artifacts back to their rightful owners but while his stepmother (Anita Mui) encourages him to use his drunken boxing skills his father feels his boozy antics bring shame to the family.

Andrew Bovell freely adapted his play Speaking in Tongues opening up the action as the geography and topography of Sydney and its suburbs become major characters as well. The film opens with a shot of what looks like a corpse entangled in a thick stand of branches -- the title plant which grows in profusion in Australia. Bovell and director Ray Lawrence take their time in explaining whose body that is and then slowly reveal with no help from a number of red herrings how it happened to be there. The principal players are Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) a psychiatrist with issues over her child a murder victim; her husband John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) an aloof professor whom she suspects of infidelity; Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) a police detective cheating on his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) who is a patient of Valerie's. Zat's mistress Jane O'May (Rachael Blake) is someone he met at a dancing class his wife dragged him to; she is estranged from her husband Pete (Glenn L. Robbins). Their neighbors Paula (Daniela Farinacci) and Nik D'Amato (Vince Colosimo) try to stay neutral in the O'Mays' split; she works days as a nurse and he's unemployed and minds their children. Suspicion around the disappearance of one character manages to enmesh all of the others. Bovell's stories are about secrets real and imagined and how they can poison relationships. The film virtually swept all the major awards at the Australian Film Institute's annual ceremony though its reception in the States was mildly respectful.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Australian</DIV></DIV>

When the film's narrative begins moments later it jumps back to World War II-era Boston where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult he turned to a life of crime which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners) he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman Jr.) upon exiting prison and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam.

Fergus (Stephen Rea) is an IRA "volunteer" who despite personal misgivings takes part in the kidnapping of a black British soldier Jody (Forest Whitaker) stationed in Northern Ireland. The IRA hopes to use Jody as a bargaining chip to win the release of IRA operatives behind bars but while guarding Jody Fergus becomes fast friends with his prisoner. Jody makes Fergus promise him that if he dies Fegus will look in on his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson) and see if she's all right. Jody escapes and Fergus doesn't have the heart to shoot him; as fate would have it Jody runs from the woods into a street only to be run over by a British police vehicle which then flushes out the IRA compound. Fergus escapes to London where he's wanted by the law for Jody's kidnapping and also by his former girlfriend IRA operative Jude (Miranda Richardson) who thinks he knows too much to fall into the hands of the British authorities. Good to his word Fergus tracks down Dil and soon the two outcasts find themselves entering into a love affair although Fergus discovers that Dil is not the sort of woman he thought she was. Writer/director Neil Jordan won an Academy Award for his screenplay; the title song which was a U.K. hit for Dave Berry in 1965 was re-recorded for the film by one-time Culture Club vocalist Boy George with backing by the Pet Shop Boys.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

Dr. Strangelove's jet-black satire (from a script by director Stanley Kubrick Peter George and Terry Southern) and a host of superb comic performances (including three from Peter Sellers) have kept the film fresh and entertaining even as its issues have become (slightly) less timely. Loaded with thermonuclear weapons a U.S. bomber piloted by Maj. T.J. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens) is on a routine flight pattern near the Soviet Union when they receive orders to commence Wing Attack Plan R best summarized by Maj. Kong as "Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!" On the ground at Burpleson Air Force Base Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) notices nothing on the news about America being at war. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) calmly informs him that he gave the command to attack the Soviet Union because it was high time someone did something about fluoridation which is sapping Americans' bodily fluids (and apparently has something to do with Ripper's sexual dysfunction). Meanwhile President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) meets with his top Pentagon advisors including super-hawk Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However the ante is upped considerably when Soviet ambassador de Sadesky (Peter Bull) informs Muffley and his staff of the latest innovation in Soviet weapons technology: a "Doomsday Machine" that will destroy the entire world if the Russians are attacked.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

Grant) is an unsuccessful pill-popping actor; "I" or Marwood (Paul McGann) is Withnail's roommate and another equally underemployed actor. The time is 1969: Withnail is fast becoming a burned-out relic of the '60s while Marwood is trying to reassimilate into society. The two take a trip to the country in hopes of rejuvenating themselves but things go from worse to even worse. Given the intimacy and insight of the screenplay and dialogue one shouldn't be surprised that Bruce Robinson (who adapted the film from his own novel) based Withnail &amp; I on his own experiences. The film proves that certain "Age of Aquarius" types were just as bollixed-up in Britain as they were in America.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

The film opens with the two strangers both newly graduated from the University of Chicago share a car trip from Chicago to New York where they are both going to make their way. During the trip they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be "just friends." They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends (played by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby) meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. The soundtrack consists primarily of Harry Connick Jr. crooning standards like "It Had to Be You."</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

Set over the course of a 24-hour period the film is a collection of short unconnected glimpses into the dropout subculture touching base with a variety of musicians students street people and general eccentrics. While there's no real plot to speak of Linklater's eye for nuance and gift for dialogue are superb and the portrait he paints is so uncannily accurate that the term "slacker" was almost immediately co-opted as a media buzzword one interchangeable with the similarly-overused "Generation X." Regardless the film is an evocative reflection of a community and its culture and remains a definitive artifact of its time and place.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed" short for Edwina (Holly Hunter) the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts and they move to the Arizona desert where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that as Hi puts it "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores has become the father of quintuplets and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you helps me" situation Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

First Loretta agrees to marry a man she does not love Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) simply because he knows how to propose properly. Before the wedding can take place Cammareri must visit his dying mother in Sicily. In his absence Loretta is supposed to try to patch up the differences between Johnny and his brother bakery operator Ronny Cammareri (Nicolas Cage). Having never forgiven Johnny for indirectly causing the accident that crippled him Ronny flies into a rage whenever his brother's name is mentioned. He does however fall for Loretta like a ton of bricks. After a torrid affair Loretta tries to avoid Ronny out of respect to Johnny but he's just too fascinating to resist. Meanwhile Loretta's father (Vincent Gardenia) is fooling around with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette) while Loretta's mother (Olympia Dukakis) is wooed by a college professor (John Mahoney). These brief flings are forgiven and forgotten but there's still the delicate situation of Loretta being in love with her future brother-in-law.

Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a popular and well-respected instructor at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha Nebraska but lately he's been unhappy in both his personal and professional life and his anxieties finally come to a head with the school's student elections. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is running for student body president and she certainly seems like the sort of girl who would win a high school election -- she's pretty popular and takes part in all the right extra-curricular activities. In fact she seems so perfect she's running unopposed which offends McAllister's sense of democracy (not to mention the fact he doesn't like her very much). So Jim intervenes and persuades Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against Tracy. Paul is not terribly bright and is entirely unqualified to be student president but as a star of the school's football team (before a leg injury sidelined him) he's popular enough to at least give Tracy a run for her money. Just as the race begins to heat up a spanner is truly thrown into the works when Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) announces she's also running for office. Publicly Tammy's platform is that the student elections are ultimately pointless and if she's elected she'll eliminate them altogether. Privately Tammy is out for revenge against her brother; it seems Tammy is experimenting with her sexuality and a recent fling with a bisexual classmate named Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia) ended when Lisa dumped her to start going out with Paul. Based on the novel by Tom Perrotta Election was directed by Alexander Payne who won enthusiastic reviews for his debut feature Citizen Ruth; Payne also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:34 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0065</DIV><DIV class="tc">In Robert Zemeckis's trailblazing combination of animation and live-action Hollywood's 1940s cartoon stars are a subjugated minority living in the ghettolike "Toontown" where their movements are sharply monitored by the human power establishment. The Toons are permitted to perform in a Cotton Club-style nightspot but are forbidden to patronize the joint. One of Toontown's leading citizens whacked-out Roger Rabbit is framed for the murder of human nightclub owner Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) whose prejudice against Toons stems from the time that his brother was killed by a falling cartoon piano reluctantly agrees to clear Roger of the accusation. Most of the sociopolitical undertones of the original novel were weeded out out of the 1988 film version with emphasis shifted to its basic "evil land developer" plotline --and more enjoyably to a stream of eye-popping special effects. With the combined facilities of animator Richard Williams Disney Warner Bros. Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic the film allows us to believe (at least for 90 minutes) that "toons" exist and that they are capable of interacting with 3-dimensional human beings. Virtually every major cartoon character of the late 1940s shows up with the exceptions of Felix the Cat and Popeye the Sailor whose licensees couldn't come to terms with the producers. Of the film's newly minted Toons the most memorable is Roger Rabbit's curvaceous bride Jessica (voiced uncredited by Kathleen Turner). The human element is well-represented by Hoskins Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy; also watch for action-film producer Joel Silver as Roger Rabbit's Tex Avery-style director.</DIV><DIV class="tc">)</DIV></DIV>

Among them are Steve (Ron Howard) and Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) college-bound with mixed feelings about leaving home; nerdy Terry "The Toad" (Charles Martin Smith) who scores a dream date with blonde Debbie (Candy Clark); and John (Paul Le Mat ) a 22-year-old drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with 13-year-old Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) in his deuce coupe. As D. J. Wolfman Jack spins 41 vintage tunes on the radio throughout the night Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) Curt chases a mystery blonde Terry tries to act cool and Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) but nothing can stop the next day from coming and with it the vastly different future ushered in by the 1960s. Fresh off The Godfather (1972) producer Francis Ford Coppola had the clout to get his friend George Lucas's project made but only for $750000 on a 28-day shooting schedule. Despite technical obstacles and having to shoot at night cinematographer Haskell Wexler gave the film the neon-lit aura that Lucas wanted evoking the authentic look of a suburban strip to go with the authentic sound of rock-n-roll. Universal which wanted to call the film Another Slow Night in Modesto thought it was unreleasable. But Lucas' period detail co-writers Willard Huyck's and Gloria Katz's realistic dialogue and the film's nostalgia for the pre-Vietnam years apparently appealed to a 1973 audience embroiled in cultural chaos: American Graffiti became the third most popular movie of 1973 (after The Exorcist and The Sting) establishing the reputations of Lucas (whose next film would be Star Wars) and his young cast and furthering the onset of soundtrack-driven youth-oriented movies. Although the film helped spark 1970s nostalgia for the 1950s nothing else would capture the flavor of the era with the same humorous candor and latent sense of foreboding.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Universal</DIV></DIV>

And that she's been sent on a holy mission with two minor characters from Clerks and Mallrats as her guides? Prepare to suspend any and all disbelief as you watch the religious satire Dogma the fourth film from writer/director Kevin Smith. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) has been disappointed in life and has found her faith severely tested after her husband leaves her when she discovers she cannot have children. So Bethany is all the more puzzled when she's approached by Metatron (Alan Rickman) a grumpy angel. Metatron wants her to help him stop Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) two fallen angels who were ejected from paradise have escaped from exile and are heading to New Jersey. If they are able to pass through the arc of a certain church it will prove God is fallible and the world will come to a swift end. Bethany has no idea what to do or why she's been given this project but she heads out anyway with her assigned assistants Jay (Jason Mewes) an appallingly rude former dope dealer and self-styled ladies man and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Along the way Bethany picks up more helpers including a celestial muse named Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and Rufus (Chris Rock) who claims to have been the 13th apostle and that Jesus owes him 12 dollars. Boasting a huge supporting cast -- including George Carlin Jason Lee Janeane Garofalo Bud Cort and Alanis Morissette (as God) -- Dogma proved to be highly controversial even before its release. Miramax Pictures owned by Disney financed the film but several weeks before Dogma's world premier at the Cannes Film Festival they announced they would not release the picture and intended to sell it to another distributor (which would turn out to be Lions Gate Films). Director Smith however has always contended that Dogma is a film about the importance of faith if not organized religion.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Lions Gate Films</DIV></DIV>

Russ Tamblyn stars as the teeny-tiny titular protagonist while veteran musicomedy favorite Jessie Mathews and stellar character actor Bernard Miles portray Tom's normal-sized parents. Journeying to the Village Tom is pounced upon by villains Ivan (Terry-Thomas) and Tony (a corpulent Peter Sellers) who intend to exploit our 5 1/2-inch-tall hero. In-between his misadventures with the villains Tom helps to expedite the romance between young forester Woody (Alan Young) and the magical Forest Queen (June Thorburn). Throughout the special effects and oversized sets are first-rate as are the "puppetoons" sequences featuring such delightful characters as The Yawning Man (voice by Stan Freberg). Written by several hands the film's songs are hummable if not particularly memorable. It is said that some children in the audience in 1958 were genuinely frightened by the more horrific aspects of the story (including the threatened execution of Tom's parents); it may be however that the adults were more scared than the kids. Incidentally while most of Tom Thumb was filmed in MGM's London facilities the special effects were produced in Hollywood requiring Russ Tamblyn to do a lot of travelling.</DIV><DIV class="tc">MGM</DIV></DIV>

Handsomely mounted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who replaced Rouben Mamoulian as director after six days of shooting) the drama follows the eighteen tumultuous years that led to the founding of the Roman Empire. Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) meets up with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and plans to lure Caesar to her boudoir in order to forge an alliance with Rome so that she may hold on to her Egyptian empire. When Caesar is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate Cleopatra is left without an ally and Egypt is up for grabs. When Roman general Mark Antony (Richard Burton) comes along she seduces him in order to make him over into her new protector. But under the charms of Cleopatra Mark Antony is reduced from a an awesome and dominating general to a sniveling drunken wimp. At the Battle of Actium Mark Antony is defeated and Cleopatra withdraws her troops dooming Mark Antony and his army. With Egypt in peril Antony and Cleopatra the doomed lovers meet each other for the last time as the enemy forces close in.</DIV><DIV class="tc">20th Century Fox</DIV></DIV>

Zanuck. Whenever possible the original locations were utilized and an all-star international cast impersonates the people involved from high-ranking officials to ordinary GIs. Each actor speaks in his or her native language with subtitles translating for the benefit of the audience (alternate "takes" were made of each scene with the foreign actors speaking English but these were seen only during the first network telecast of the film in 1972). The stars are listed alphabetically with the exception of John Wayne who as Lt. Colonel Vandervoort gets separate billing. Others in the huge cast include Eddie Albert Jean-Louis Barrault Richard Burton Red Buttons Sean Connery Henry Fonda Gert Frobe Curt Jurgens Peter Lawford Robert Mitchum Kenneth More Edmond O'Brien Robert Ryan Jean Servais Rod Steiger and Robert Wagner. Paul Anka who wrote the film's title song shows up as an Army private. Scenes include the Allies parachuting into Ste. Mere Englise where the paratroopers were mowed down by German bullets; a real-life sequence wherein the German and Allied troops unwittingly march side by side in the dark of night; and a spectacular three-minute overhead shot of the troops fighting and dying in the streets of Quistreham.

Among them are Steve (Ron Howard) and Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) college-bound with mixed feelings about leaving home; nerdy Terry "The Toad" (Charles Martin Smith) who scores a dream date with blonde Debbie (Candy Clark); and John (Paul Le Mat ) a 22-year-old drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with 13-year-old Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) in his deuce coupe. As D. J. Wolfman Jack spins 41 vintage tunes on the radio throughout the night Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) Curt chases a mystery blonde Terry tries to act cool and Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) but nothing can stop the next day from coming and with it the vastly different future ushered in by the 1960s. Fresh off The Godfather (1972) producer Francis Ford Coppola had the clout to get his friend George Lucas's project made but only for $750000 on a 28-day shooting schedule. Despite technical obstacles and having to shoot at night cinematographer Haskell Wexler gave the film the neon-lit aura that Lucas wanted evoking the authentic look of a suburban strip to go with the authentic sound of rock-n-roll. Universal which wanted to call the film Another Slow Night in Modesto thought it was unreleasable. But Lucas' period detail co-writers Willard Huyck's and Gloria Katz's realistic dialogue and the film's nostalgia for the pre-Vietnam years apparently appealed to a 1973 audience embroiled in cultural chaos: American Graffiti became the third most popular movie of 1973 (after The Exorcist and The Sting) establishing the reputations of Lucas (whose next film would be Star Wars) and his young cast and furthering the onset of soundtrack-driven youth-oriented movies. Although the film helped spark 1970s nostalgia for the 1950s nothing else would capture the flavor of the era with the same humorous candor and latent sense of foreboding.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Universal</DIV></DIV>

And that she's been sent on a holy mission with two minor characters from Clerks and Mallrats as her guides? Prepare to suspend any and all disbelief as you watch the religious satire Dogma the fourth film from writer/director Kevin Smith. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) has been disappointed in life and has found her faith severely tested after her husband leaves her when she discovers she cannot have children. So Bethany is all the more puzzled when she's approached by Metatron (Alan Rickman) a grumpy angel. Metatron wants her to help him stop Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) two fallen angels who were ejected from paradise have escaped from exile and are heading to New Jersey. If they are able to pass through the arc of a certain church it will prove God is fallible and the world will come to a swift end. Bethany has no idea what to do or why she's been given this project but she heads out anyway with her assigned assistants Jay (Jason Mewes) an appallingly rude former dope dealer and self-styled ladies man and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Along the way Bethany picks up more helpers including a celestial muse named Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and Rufus (Chris Rock) who claims to have been the 13th apostle and that Jesus owes him 12 dollars. Boasting a huge supporting cast -- including George Carlin Jason Lee Janeane Garofalo Bud Cort and Alanis Morissette (as God) -- Dogma proved to be highly controversial even before its release. Miramax Pictures owned by Disney financed the film but several weeks before Dogma's world premier at the Cannes Film Festival they announced they would not release the picture and intended to sell it to another distributor (which would turn out to be Lions Gate Films). Director Smith however has always contended that Dogma is a film about the importance of faith if not organized religion.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Lions Gate Films</DIV></DIV>

The film's story begins nearly three decades into George's reign in 1788 as the unstable king (Nigel Hawthorne reprising his stage role) begins to show signs of increasing dementia from violent fits of foul language to bouts of forgetfulness. This weakness seems like the perfect chance to overthrow the unpopular George whom many blamed for the loss of the American colonies in favor of the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett) but the king's prime minister William Pitt (Julian Wadham) and his wife Queen Charlotte (Helen Mirren) are determined to protect the throne. Doctors are brought in but the archaic treatments of the time prove of little value. In desperation they turn to Dr. Willis (Ian Holm) a harsh unconventional specialist whose unusual methods recall modern psychiatry. Willis struggles to break through to the mad king treating him with an anger and haughtiness George has never before experienced. Stressing the absurdity of the entire situation Bennett's witty screenplay emphasizes dry humor over tragedy even utilizing references to King Lear for comic effect.

Running over three hours and made with the combined contributions of two major studios (20th Century-Fox Paramount) at a cost of more than $200 million Titanic ranked as the most expensive film in Hollywood history at the time of its release and became the most successful. Writer-director James Cameron employed state-of-the-art digital special effects for this production realized on a monumental scale and spanning eight decades. Inspired by the 1985 discovery of the Titanic in the North Atlantic the contemporary storyline involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals she's the person in the portrait she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiance Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. Cameron launched the project after seeing Robert Ballard's 1987 National Geographic documentary on the wreckage. Blueprints of the real Titanic were followed during construction at Fox's custom-built Rosarito Mexico studio where a hydraulics system moved an immense model in a 17-million-gallon water tank. During three weeks aboard the Russian ship Academik Keldysh underwater sequences were filmed with a 35mm camera in a titanium case mounted on the Russian submersible Mir 1. When the submersible neared the wreck a video camera inside a remote-operated vehicle was sent into the Titanic's 400-foot bow bringing back footage of staterooms furniture and chandeliers. On November 1 1997 the film had its world premiere at the 10th Tokyo International Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">to :   </DIV></DIV>

E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole in the role that made him a star). After a prologue showing us Lawrence's ultimate fate we flash back to Cairo in 1917. A bored general staffer Lawrence talks his way into a transfer to Arabia. Once in the desert he befriends Sherif Ali Ben El Kharish (Omar Sharif making one of the most spectacular entrances in movie history) and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrence's motives in this matter: Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) dismisses him as yet another "desert-loving Englishman" and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). After successfully completing his mission Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden (Claude Rains) who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer). In the heat of the next battle a wild-eyed Lawrence screams "No prisoners!" and fights more ruthlessly than ever. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson used T. E. Lawrence's own self-published memoir The Seven Pillars of Wisdom as their principal source although some of the characters are composites and many of the "historical" incidents are of unconfirmed origin. Two years in the making (you can see O'Toole's weight fluctuate from scene to scene) the movie lensed in Spain and Jordan ended up costing a then-staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. The 1962 Royal Premiere in London was virtually the last time that David Lean's director's cut was seen: 20 minutes were edited from the film's general release and 15 more from the 1971 reissue. This abbreviated version was all that was available for public exhibition until a massive 1989 restoration at 216 minutes that returned several of Lean's favorite scenes while removing others with which he had never been satisfied.</DIV><DIV class="tc">to :   </DIV></DIV>

Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into the Bramford an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated she begins to suspect that the Castevets' circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth and the baby is taken away from her. Polanski's camerawork and Richard Sylbert's production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemary's fears chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewer's imagination. This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-'60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle Rosemary's Baby became a critically praised hit winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Inspiring a wave of satanic horror from The Exorcist (1973) to The Omen (1976) Rosemary's Baby helped usher in the genre's modern era by combining a supernatural story with Alfred Hitchcock's propensity for finding normality horrific.</DIV><DIV class="tc">to :   </DIV></DIV>

Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin a schlemiel's schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior in honor of Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks or rather commands: "Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!" Before long the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective a sadistic dentist and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile Mr. Mushnik who has stumbled onto Seymour's secret has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith who also wrote the script and supplied the plant's voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s. By the mid-1970s it had attained classic status spawning a big-budget Broadway musical (and followup feature film) in the 1980s and a Saturday morning cartoon series in the 1990s. Enhancing the original Little Shop's reputation was the brief appearance by star-in-the-making Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (Nicholson is often incorrectly referred to as the star of the film though in fact he barely receives billing). Much as we love Nicholson our vote for the most memorable Little Shop cast member goes to the ubiquitous Dick Miller ("No thanks I'll eat it here").</DIV><DIV class="tc">to :   </DIV></DIV>

In 1937 frizzy-haired Red co-ed Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) briefly captures the attention of preppy jock Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford) with her passionate pacifism while the writing talent beneath his privileged exterior entrances her. Almost eight years later the two are reunited in New York when well-coiffed leftist radio worker Katie spies military officer Hubbell snoozing in a nightclub. Through her force of will and in spite of his smug rich friends the two opposites fall in love sparring over Katie's activist zeal and Hubbell's writerly ambivalence after a failed first novel. They head to Hollywood so that Hubbell can write a screenplay for his buddy-turned-producer J.J. (Bradford Dillman). But the House Committee on Un-American Activities' Communist witch hunt in 1947 tears the pair apart as a pregnant Katie refuses to keep silent about the jailing of the Hollywood Ten while a faithless Hubbell decides to save his career. When the two meet again at the dawn of the '60s TV hack Hubbell and A-bomb protestor Katie feel the old pull but they have to decide if it's worth the grief. Although blacklisted writers had returned to Hollywood -- and won Oscars -- by the early 1970s the HUAC sections of Arthur Laurents's screenplay were still considered dicey resulting in substantial cuts; Laurents reportedly blamed star Redford for not fighting them hard enough. Regardless of the edits and critics' complaints about the film's schlockiness 1973 audiences went for the well-executed and still politically tinged weepie turning The Way We Were into one of the most popular films of 1973 and Redford into a major heartthrob. Streisand won an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the Streisand-sung title tune won for Best Song. Despite the eviscerated politics The Way We Were poignantly captures the insoluble dilemma of reconciling private desires with public awareness.</DIV><DIV class="tc">to :   </DIV></DIV>

Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals she's the person in the portrait she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiance Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. Cameron launched the project after seeing Robert Ballard's 1987 National Geographic documentary on the wreckage. Blueprints of the real Titanic were followed during construction at Fox's custom-built Rosarito Mexico studio where a hydraulics system moved an immense model in a 17-million-gallon water tank. During three weeks aboard the Russian ship Academik Keldysh underwater sequences were filmed with a 35mm camera in a titanium case mounted on the Russian submersible Mir 1. When the submersible neared the wreck a video camera inside a remote-operated vehicle was sent into the Titanic's 400-foot bow bringing back footage of staterooms furniture and chandeliers. On November 1 1997 the film had its world premiere at the 10th Tokyo International Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0307</DIV><DIV class="tc">This sweeping highly literate historical epic covers the Allies' mideastern campaign during World War I as seen through the eyes of the enigmatic T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole in the role that made him a star). After a prologue showing us Lawrence's ultimate fate we flash back to Cairo in 1917. A bored general staffer Lawrence talks his way into a transfer to Arabia. Once in the desert he befriends Sherif Ali Ben El Kharish (Omar Sharif making one of the most spectacular entrances in movie history) and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrence's motives in this matter: Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) dismisses him as yet another "desert-loving Englishman" and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). After successfully completing his mission Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden (Claude Rains) who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer). In the heat of the next battle a wild-eyed Lawrence screams "No prisoners!" and fights more ruthlessly than ever. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson used T. E. Lawrence's own self-published memoir The Seven Pillars of Wisdom as their principal source although some of the characters are composites and many of the "historical" incidents are of unconfirmed origin. Two years in the making (you can see O'Toole's weight fluctuate from scene to scene) the movie lensed in Spain and Jordan ended up costing a then-staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. The 1962 Royal Premiere in London was virtually the last time that David Lean's director's cut was seen: 20 minutes were edited from the film's general release and 15 more from the 1971 reissue. This abbreviated version was all that was available for public exhibition until a massive 1989 restoration at 216 minutes that returned several of Lean's favorite scenes while removing others with which he had never been satisfied.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>

Sim plays Ebenezer Scrooge a London miser who despite his wealth refuses to make charitable contributions and treats his sole employee Bob Cratchit as an indentured servant. On Christmas Eve Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his late business partner Jacob Marley who was as selfish as Scrooge in life and has been condemned to an eternity of wandering the Earth in shackles. Marley informs Scrooge that he's to receive a trio of spirits that night who will take him on a journey through Christmases Past Present and Yet to Come. As Scrooge encounters each apparition he is taken on a tour of his life and realizes what a wretch he is transformed by greed from an idealistic youth into an embittered ogre.

One day while plunking dejectedly on the piano Nina looks up to discover Jamie in ghostly form lively as ever and just as loving. With a few new wrinkles (such as parties which include Jamie's newfound ghost friends) they resume living their relationship almost as before. Nina's friends are puzzled at her change from suicidal despondency to giddy cheefulness but Jamie has pledged Nina to secrecy about their renewed relationship.

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) already on the edge is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to "Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all." Coppola himself was not certain either and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press the Palme d'Or-winning "work-in-progress" shown at Cannes and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself have been superbly captured in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:    Hearts of Darkness :</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0442</DIV><DIV class="tc">In Roman Polanski's first American film adapted from Ira Levin's horror bestseller a young wife comes to believe that her offspring is not of this world. Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into the Bramford an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated she begins to suspect that the Castevets' circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth and the baby is taken away from her. Polanski's camerawork and Richard Sylbert's production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemary's fears chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewer's imagination. This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-'60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle Rosemary's Baby became a critically praised hit winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Inspiring a wave of satanic horror from The Exorcist (1973) to The Omen (1976) Rosemary's Baby helped usher in the genre's modern era by combining a supernatural story with Alfred Hitchcock's propensity for finding normality horrific.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0476</DIV><DIV class="tc">Perhaps the greatest movie ever shot in two days Little Shop of Horrors was originally conceived as a followup to Roger Corman's black comedy A Bucket of Blood (1959). Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin a schlemiel's schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior in honor of Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks or rather commands: "Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!" Before long the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective a sadistic dentist and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile Mr. Mushnik who has stumbled onto Seymour's secret has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith who also wrote the script and supplied the plant's voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s. By the mid-1970s it had attained classic status spawning a big-budget Broadway musical (and followup feature film) in the 1980s and a Saturday morning cartoon series in the 1990s. Enhancing the original Little Shop's reputation was the brief appearance by star-in-the-making Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (Nicholson is often incorrectly referred to as the star of the film though in fact he barely receives billing). Much as we love Nicholson our vote for the most memorable Little Shop cast member goes to the ubiquitous Dick Miller ("No thanks I'll eat it here").</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>

In 1937 frizzy-haired Red co-ed Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) briefly captures the attention of preppy jock Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford) with her passionate pacifism while the writing talent beneath his privileged exterior entrances her. Almost eight years later the two are reunited in New York when well-coiffed leftist radio worker Katie spies military officer Hubbell snoozing in a nightclub. Through her force of will and in spite of his smug rich friends the two opposites fall in love sparring over Katie's activist zeal and Hubbell's writerly ambivalence after a failed first novel. They head to Hollywood so that Hubbell can write a screenplay for his buddy-turned-producer J.J. (Bradford Dillman). But the House Committee on Un-American Activities' Communist witch hunt in 1947 tears the pair apart as a pregnant Katie refuses to keep silent about the jailing of the Hollywood Ten while a faithless Hubbell decides to save his career. When the two meet again at the dawn of the '60s TV hack Hubbell and A-bomb protestor Katie feel the old pull but they have to decide if it's worth the grief. Although blacklisted writers had returned to Hollywood -- and won Oscars -- by the early 1970s the HUAC sections of Arthur Laurents's screenplay were still considered dicey resulting in substantial cuts; Laurents reportedly blamed star Redford for not fighting them hard enough. Regardless of the edits and critics' complaints about the film's schlockiness 1973 audiences went for the well-executed and still politically tinged weepie turning The Way We Were into one of the most popular films of 1973 and Redford into a major heartthrob. Streisand won an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the Streisand-sung title tune won for Best Song. Despite the eviscerated politics The Way We Were poignantly captures the insoluble dilemma of reconciling private desires with public awareness.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>

As the title suggests Gould's life is explored through a series of thirty-two self-contained but interrelated vignettes a structure inspired by Bach's "Goldberg Variations" the compositions that were the basis for one of Gould's most famous recordings. Fictional recreations many starring an excellent Colm Feore as Gould follow the musician from his precocious childhood to his early death at the age of fifty. Juicy biographical details like a surprising early retirement from public performance and an addiction to prescription drugs are featured prominently but equal attention is paid to Gould's challenging theoretical ideas. Director Francois Girard refuses to provide easy explanations for the pianist's quirks instead using his unconventional structure to provide great insight while suggesting the real Gould remains essentially unknowable. Especially interesting is the film's mix of dramatization and documentary as it juxtaposes its fictional recreations with actual interviews with Gould's friends and associates.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:    Glenn Gould :</DIV></DIV>

Chow Yun-Fat Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung portray a trio of orphans who have grown to become art thieves. When their foster father (Kenneth Tsang) a powerful crime boss forces them into stealing a painting they pull off the job but are double-crossed. To get even the trio plans a heist to steal the painting back. The three lead characters are funny and romantic; they're daring art thieves in the tradition of "The Cat" from To Catch a Thief or The Pink Panther and the film evokes the same cosmopolitan feel. Once a Thief is far less bloody than Woo's gangster pictures but in this film the burglary sequences possess all the astounding grace of his other films' gunfights.</DIV><DIV class="tc">:   </DIV></DIV>

An aging king (Dakin Matthews) and a widowed queen (Sandy Duncan) arrange a marriage between his only daughter and her only son despite the two children's initial dislike of one another. Eventually they fall in love but the evil sorcerer Rothbart (Jack Palance) desiring the throne for himself enchants the princess Odette (Michelle Nicastro). She is a swan by day and becomes a woman only when the moon rises. Prince Derek (Howard McGillin) refuses to accept another bride and continues to search for his lost love. When he finds her Derek must fight the sorcerer to free her from the spell. Winner of the Film Advisory Board Award of Excellence and the Parent's Choice Award this adventure exhibits high quality animation and a blend of romantic and humorous musical numbers.

This is because Zeffirelli broke the long-standing tradition of casting over-aged sometimes grey-haired players in the title roles. Seventeen-year-old Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey as Juliet. The youthfulness and inexperience of the leading players works beautifully in the more passionate sequences (some of these breaking further ground by being played in the nude). Among the younger players are Michael York as Tybalt and John McEnery as Mercutio. The duel between Romeo and Tybalt starts out as a harmless frat-boy exchange of insults then escalates into tragedy before any of the participants are fully aware of what has happened. Photographed by Pasqualino DeSantis on various locations in Italy Romeo and Juliet was one of the most profitable film adaptations of Shakespeare ever produced. Its most lasting legacy is its popular main theme music composed by Nino Rota.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Franco Zeffirelli</DIV></DIV>

Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D &amp; D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened but didn't Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission. Featuring Brando's famous "I coulda been a contendah" speech On the Waterfront has often been seen as an allegory of "naming names" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s. Director Elia Kazan famously informed on suspected Communists before a government committee -- unlike many of his colleagues some of whom went to prison for refusing to "name names" and many more of whom were blacklisted from working in the film industry for many years to come -- and Budd Schulberg's screenplay has often been read as an elaborate defense of the informer's position. On the Waterfront won Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actor for Brando and Best Supporting Actress for Saint.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Marlon Brando</DIV></DIV>

When the film's narrative begins moments later it jumps back to World War II-era Boston where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult he turned to a life of crime which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners) he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman Jr.) upon exiting prison and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Marriage to a Muslim nurse named Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) follows after which X spearheads a well-attended march on a Harlem hospital housing a Muslim recovering from an episode of police brutality. The march's success helps elevate X to the position of Islam's national spokesperson. There is dissension in the ranks however and soon X is targeted for assassination by other Nation leaders; even Elijah Mohammed fears Malcolm's growing influence. After getting wind of the murder plot X leaves the Nation of Islam embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca that proves revelatory; renouncing his separatist beliefs his oratories begin embracing all races and cultures. During a 1965 speech Malcolm X is shot and killed reportedly by Nation of Islam members.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Spike Lee</DIV></DIV>

Based on Farley Mowat's autobiographical novel of the same name Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) is a normal biologist until he gets up into the Arctic winter in order to prove that the caribou herds are not being decimated by wolves; then he becomes a semi-klutz unable to instinctively adapt to the deep freeze around him. After he sets up his first stake-out a native Inuit named Oolek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) comes along to help him out and gets him better established in an isolated hut where Tyler is left to fend for himself again. That he does but not because he can see in advance what his needs or problems are going to be -- he just comes up against the worst when it happens and works from there. At the same time Tyler gets to carefully and closely observe a wolf family he has already dubbed as George Angeline and the three pups and he has several comic interactions with his distant "pets." Oolek and his friend Mike (Samson Jorah) drop by to keep Tyler company for awhile sharing their observations on nature and life in an easy-going non-committal manner. With Tyler's perseverance and the knowledge gained from experience and through these conversations the real culprit in the decimation of the caribou turns out not to have four legs at all.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Carroll Ballard</DIV></DIV>

Burroughs's novel of the same name with elements of the author's biography and plenty of the cerebral alienation and biomorphic special effects fans of creepy cult director David Cronenberg have come to expect. Bill Lee (Peter Weller) wants to write but he exterminates bugs to pay the bills. His wife Joan (Judy Davis) becomes addicted to Bill's bug powder dust and soon he joins her in a world of unorthodox hallucinogens; he visits the kindly yet sinister Dr. Benway (Roy Scheider) and walks away with his first dose of the black meat -- a narcotic made from the flesh of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede. Soon monstrous beetles are whispering conspiracy theories in Bill's ears and his nebbish writer friends Hank (Nicholas Campbell) and Martin (Michael Zelniker) are sleeping with Joan under his nose. When a party trick involving a liquor glass and a gun goes awry killing Joan Bill flees to Interzone a Mediterranean city full of talking insectoid typewriters double agents offbeat aesthetes and plots within plots. As he navigates this paranoid landscape Bill begins ingesting another drug called mugwump jism and writes fragments that Hank and Martin soon assemble into a novel under the title Naked Lunch. As beat literature aficionados know Interzone is based on Tangiers -- the city where Burroughs wrote Naked Lunch. The incident in the film in which Hank and Martin appropriate Bill's writing and have it published closely approximates the real-life circumstances of the novel's publication although it was Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac who helped out the real-life Burroughs. The William Tell incident that kills Bill's wife is also drawn from the author's real life. "William Lee" is both Burroughs' literary stand-in and the name under which he published his first autobiographical novel Junky. Ian Holm who plays Joan Frost's husband Tom would appear in Cronenberg's similarly experimental eXistenZ several years later.</DIV><DIV class="tc">David Cronenberg</DIV></DIV>

Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam where he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers under two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both personal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks "in country" Taylor begins to see the naïveté of his views of the war especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves into a round of murder and rape. Unlike Hollywood's first wave of Vietnam movies (including The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Now and Coming Home) Platoon is a grunt's-eye view of the war touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the battles and suffered the wounds. In this sense it resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers as it mixes familiar elements of onscreen battle with small realistic details: bugs jungle rot exhaustion C-rations marijuana and counting the days before you go home. This mix of traditional war movie elements with a contemporary sensibility won Platoon four Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director and a reputation as one of the definitive modern war films.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Oliver Stone</DIV></DIV>

When Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) hears that the Texas cemetery where her grandfather is buried has been vandalized she gathers her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) and several other friends together to see if grandpa's remains are still in one piece. While in the area Sally and her friends decide to visit grandfather's old farmhouse. Unfortunately a family of homicidal slaughterhouse workers who take their job home with them have taken over the house next door. Included amongst the brood is Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) a chainsaw-wielding human horror show who wears a face mask made out of human skin. Sally's friends are rapidly exterminated one-by-one by the next-door neighbors leaving only Sally left to fight off Leatherface and his clan.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Tobe Hooper</DIV></DIV>

This is the credo of the aptly named Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) the antihero of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Gekko a high-rolling corporate raider is idolized by young-and-hungry broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Inveigling himself into Gekko's inner circle Fox quickly learns to rape murder and bury his sense of ethics. Only when Gekko's wheeling and dealing causes a near-tragedy on a personal level does Fox "reform"-though his means of destroying Gekko are every bit as underhanded as his previous activities on the trading floor. Director Stone who cowrote Wall Street with Stanley Weiser has claimed that the film was prompted by the callous treatment afforded his stockbroker father after 50 years in the business; this may be why the film's most compelling scenes are those between Bud Fox and his airline mechanic father (played by Charlie Sheen's real-life dad Martin). Ironically Wall Street was released just before the October 1987 stock market crash.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Oliver Stone</DIV></DIV>

Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series "Bluntman and Chronic" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith) two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship much to the consternation of Banky whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past however Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his "New Jersey series" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Kevin Smith</DIV></DIV>

The actors have only slight physical changes to suggest animal characteristics plus tails protruding from their Edwardian-style costumes. In pre-WW I England fascist Weasels prowl the countryside forcing modest Mole (Steve Coogan) from his underground home after the Weasels acquire the meadow from wealthy waddling Mr. Toad (Jones). Toad's inheritance is leaking away because of his fascination with the recently invented motorcar. After Mole takes shelter with refined Rat (Idle) the two set out for Toad's cavernous mansion. Toad crashes into another vehicle but unfortunately his attorney (Cleese) has nothing nice to say in Toad's defense. Toad's behavior in court prompts the judge (Stephen Fry) to give him a century-long jail sentence. Rat and Mole plan to spring Toad with the help of the hibernating Badger (Nicol Williamson) but Toad simultaneously puts his own escape plan into motion. Back at Toad Hall the Weasels construct a dog-food factory and intend to destroy the main house by blowing it up-so the threatened animals make plans to retake Toad Hall. Crew members who worked on past Python films include James Acheson (production/costume design) and John Du Prez (original music and songs). Lawrence Van Gelder (New York Times) reviewed "The Wind in the Willows brimming with verbal and visual wit and imagination driven by high adventure reveling in English eccentricity enlivened by bursts of song unafraid of ideas and filled with color and splendid performances exposes most other movies intended to attract children as out-and-out pap."

James Caviezel stars as Private Witt a deserter living in peace and harmony with the natives of a Pacific island paradise. Captured by the Navy Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt goes ashore in the company of his fellow soldiers they meet diverse fates. Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson) is killed by an exploding grenade. Captain John Gaff (John Cusack) is an intelligent sober leader facing the destruction of his command because his commanding officer Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) is bucking for a general's star. Sergeant McCron (John Savage) loses his mind. Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) gets a "Dear John" letter from his beloved wife. However as the U.S. troops advance up grassy slopes toward entrenched Japanese positions it is Witt's voiced-over ruminations on life death and nature that are the real heart and soul of The Thin Red Line (1998). Adrien Brody appears as Private Fife the major character of Jones' novel and the author's alter-ego although Fife has been relegated to a minor supporting role by Malick's filmed adaptation.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1998</DIV></DIV>

Wells's War of the Worlds had been on the Paramount Pictures docket since the silent era when it was optioned as a potential Cecil B. DeMille production. When Paramount finally got around to a filming the Wells novel the property was firmly in the hands of special-effects maestro George Pal. Like Orson Welles's infamous 1938 radio adaptation the film eschews Wells's original Victorian England setting for a contemporary American locale in this case Southern California. A meteorlike object crash-lands near the small town of Linda Rosa. Among the crowd of curious onlookers is Pacific Tech scientist Gene Barry who strikes up a friendship with Ann Robinson the niece of local minister Lewis Martin. Because the meteor is too hot to approach at present Barry decides to wait a few days to investigate leaving three townsmen to guard the strange glowing object. Left alone the three men decide to approach the meterorite and are evaporated for their trouble. It turns out that this is no meteorite but an invading spaceship from the planet Mars. The hideous-looking Martians utilize huge mushroomlike flying ships equipped with heat rays to pursue the helpless earthlings. When the military is called in the Martians demonstrate their ruthlessness by "zapping" Ann's minister uncle who'd hoped to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the standoff. As Barry and Ann seek shelter the Martians go on a destructive rampage. Nothing-not even an atom-bomb blast-can halt the Martian death machines. The film's climax occurs in a besieged Los Angeles where Barry fights through a crowd of refugees and looters so that he may be reunited with Ann in Earth's last moments of existence. In the end the Martians are defeated not by science or the military but by bacteria germs-or to quote H.G. Wells "the humblest things that God in his wisdom has put upon the earth." Forty years' worth of progressively improving special effects have not dimmed the brilliance of George Pal's War of the Worlds. Even on television Pal's Oscar-winning camera trickery is awesome to behold. So indelible an impression has this film made on modern-day sci-fi mavens that when a 1988 TV version of War of the Worlds was put together it was conceived as a direct sequel to the 1953 film rather than a derivation of the Wells novel or the Welles radio production.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1953</DIV></DIV>

The actors have only slight physical changes to suggest animal characteristics plus tails protruding from their Edwardian-style costumes. In pre-WW I England fascist Weasels prowl the countryside forcing modest Mole (Steve Coogan) from his underground home after the Weasels acquire the meadow from wealthy waddling Mr. Toad (Jones). Toad's inheritance is leaking away because of his fascination with the recently invented motorcar. After Mole takes shelter with refined Rat (Idle) the two set out for Toad's cavernous mansion. Toad crashes into another vehicle but unfortunately his attorney (Cleese) has nothing nice to say in Toad's defense. Toad's behavior in court prompts the judge (Stephen Fry) to give him a century-long jail sentence. Rat and Mole plan to spring Toad with the help of the hibernating Badger (Nicol Williamson) but Toad simultaneously puts his own escape plan into motion. Back at Toad Hall the Weasels construct a dog-food factory and intend to destroy the main house by blowing it up-so the threatened animals make plans to retake Toad Hall. Crew members who worked on past Python films include James Acheson (production/costume design) and John Du Prez (original music and songs). Lawrence Van Gelder (New York Times) reviewed "The Wind in the Willows brimming with verbal and visual wit and imagination driven by high adventure reveling in English eccentricity enlivened by bursts of song unafraid of ideas and filled with color and splendid performances exposes most other movies intended to attract children as out-and-out pap." This film should not be confused with the 1996 animated adaptation which also has Michael Palin in the cast. Filmed at Burnham Beeches (in Buckinghamshire England). Other earlier versions: the second half of Disney's animated The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949); live-action by the Minneapolis Children's Theatre (1983); stop-motion animation for British TV (1983); 1982 stop-motion animation by John Semper (Spider-Man); and Rankin-Bass animation for U.S. TV (1987).</DIV><DIV class="tc">1983</DIV></DIV>

Adapted by Karl Tunberg and a raft of uncredited writers including Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson the film once more recounts the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who lives in Judea with his family during the time that Jesus Christ was becoming known for his "radical" teachings. Ben-Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) is now an ambitious Roman tribune; when Ben-Hur refuses to help Messala round up local dissidents on behalf of the emperor Messala pounces on the first opportunity to exact revenge on his onetime friend. Tried on a trumped-up charge of attempting to kill the provincial governor (whose head was accidentally hit by a falling tile) Ben-Hur is condemned to the Roman galleys while his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) are imprisoned. But during a sea battle Ben-Hur saves the life of commander Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who in gratitude adopts Ben-Hur as his son and gives him full control over his stable of racing horses. Ben-Hur never gives up trying to find his family or exact revenge on Messala. At crucial junctures in his life he also crosses the path of Jesus and each time he benefits from it. The highlight of the film's 212 minutes is its now-legendary chariot race staged largely by stunt expert Yakima Canutt. Ben-Hur's Oscar haul included Best Picture Best Director for the legendary William Wyler Best Actor for Heston and Best Supporting Actor for Welsh actor Hugh Griffith as an Arab sheik.</DIV><DIV class="tc">   Ben - Hur :</DIV></DIV>

Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D &amp; D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened but didn't Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission. Featuring Brando's famous "I coulda been a contendah" speech On the Waterfront has often been seen as an allegory of "naming names" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s. Director Elia Kazan famously informed on suspected Communists before a government committee -- unlike many of his colleagues some of whom went to prison for refusing to "name names" and many more of whom were blacklisted from working in the film industry for many years to come -- and Budd Schulberg's screenplay has often been read as an elaborate defense of the informer's position. On the Waterfront won Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actor for Brando and Best Supporting Actress for Saint.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Elia Kazan</DIV></DIV>

The "group" started as an informal skiffle band eventually maturing into an R&amp;B act called the Thamesmen (their hit was "Gimme Some Money"). After going through a psychedelic period with "Listen to the Flower People" the band mutated into Spinal Tap a hard rock outfit responsible for such albums as "Intravenous DeMilo" "The Sun Never Sweats" and "Bent for the Rent." This Is Spinal Tap finds them in the midst of their first American tour in years as they support their new LP Smell the Glove with filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) who specializes in TV commercials on hand to document the occasion. Just about anything that can go wrong does: shows get canceled stage props go wrong wireless guitar pickups start broadcasting air-traffic reports no one shows up for in-store appearances David's girlfriend tries to take over the band they wind up billed second to a puppet show at an amusement park and the group teeters on the verge of breakup.

Chow Yun-Fat Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung portray a trio of orphans who have grown to become art thieves. When their foster father (Kenneth Tsang) a powerful crime boss forces them into stealing a painting they pull off the job but are double-crossed. To get even the trio plans a heist to steal the painting back. The three lead characters are funny and romantic; they're daring art thieves in the tradition of "The Cat" from To Catch a Thief or The Pink Panther and the film evokes the same cosmopolitan feel. Once a Thief is far less bloody than Woo's gangster pictures but in this film the burglary sequences possess all the astounding grace of his other films' gunfights.</DIV><DIV class="tc">John Woo</DIV></DIV>

It also got him into the hospital after performing a stunt in which he fell through a glass canopy -- and stopped breathing. The story itself is not particularly profound. Kevin (Ga-kui) (Chan) is an honest self-effacing cop who manages to capture drug lord Cho (Cho Leung) almost single-handedly. A reluctant Kevin is then assigned the job of protecting Cho's secretary Selena (Brigitte Lin) who is going to testify against him. Sure enough the trial date comes and Selena disappears while Cho has to be set free for lack of evidence. The next thing he knows Kevin is framed by Cho for the murder of a fellow (dirty) cop and is running like heck from the bad guys as well as the police. Some incredible stunts in this film include Chan being dragged behind a double-decker bus. One of Jackie Chan's trademarks are hilarious outtakes shown during the end credits and they are among the best here. This feature is repeated to great advantage at the end of his 1998 hit Rush Hour as well. Police Story picked up "Best Picture" and "Best Action Choreography" at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Festival and was nominated for several other awards that year.

Every ingredient of the quintessential Woo thriller is present including his ever-present anti-hero (Chow Yun-Fat). Yun-Fat portrays a maverick clarinet-playing cop nicknamed "Tequila" whose partner is killed in the dizzying chaos of a restaurant gunfight with a small army of gangsters. It is soon revealed that one of the mob's high-ranking assassins is Tony (Tony Leung) an undercover cop who despite his badge is dangerously close to the edge. Tequila and Tony must team up in a tense partnership and their common pursuit of a vicious crime lord results in a brilliantly elaborate climax in a hospital where the heroes must rescue newborn babies from the maternity ward while fighting off dozens of mob soldiers. The characters Tequila and Tony are two sides of the same coin another trademark theme of Woo's films that would later be most fully realized with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta in the American hit Face/Off.</DIV><DIV class="tc">John Woo</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0791</DIV><DIV class="tc">Jackie Chan returns in one of his greatest roles in this action-comedy sequel to his 1978 Hong Kong blockbuster Drunken Master. Wong Fei Hong (Chan) is a young master of the martial art of "drunken boxing" in which fighters use alcohol to blind themselves to pain and release the angry brawler within; with the right amount of drinks under his belt Hong can become a furious one-man army. Hong accompanies his father (Ti Lung) on a voyage to China where they purchase a precious supply of ginseng. When Hong discovers thugs stealing from their luggage he leaps into action to get their belongings back. Instead he winds up with a box of valuable Chinese artifacts which criminals are hoping to smuggle to England at a tremendous profit. Hong sets out to fight the gangsters and give the artifacts back to their rightful owners but while his stepmother (Anita Mui) encourages him to use his drunken boxing skills his father feels his boozy antics bring shame to the family. Jackie Chan brought some of his most elaborate stunt work to Drunken Master 2 including a remarkable fight on a bed of hot coals; Chan also directed part of the film after Lau Kar Leung was fired after a number of disagreements with his star. Six years after it became a box office hit in Asia Drunken Master 2 earned a theatrical release in the United States; the film was re-titled Legend Of The Drunken Master (in part because the original Drunken Master never had a proper theatrical release in America) re-edited and dubbed into English with a new score by Michael Wandmacher.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Jackie Chan</DIV></DIV>

Haley Joel Osment stars as David a "mecha" or robot of the future when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. The first mecha designed to experience love David is the "son" of Henry (Sam Robards) an employee of the company that built the boy and the grief-stricken Monica (Frances O'Connor). David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son but when their natural child recovers David is abandoned and sets out to become "a real boy" worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way David is mentored by a pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a talking "super toy" bear named Teddy. His adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style "Flesh Fair" where mechas are destroyed for the amusement of humans; Rouge City where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and finally a submerged New York City where David's creator Professor Hobby (William Hurt) reveals the secrets of the boy's creation.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">1189</DIV><DIV class="tc">The film version of The Natural pulls off the neat trick of conveying the spirit of the Bernard Malamud novel upon which it is based even while changing both the outcome and the meaning of Malamud's closing chapters. In his first film appearance in four years Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs a farm boy with a hankering to be a great baseball player. With his faithful homemade bat "Wonderboy" in hand Roy heads to the big city. En route he arouses the fascination of the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey). Luring the boy to a hotel room Harriet asks Roy what he wants out of life. Roy brashly responds he wants to be "the best there is" whereupon Harriet whips out a gun and shoots Roy down. Sixteen years later a humbler Roy Hobbs emerges from the bush leagues to become a 35-year-old "rookie" on the 1939 lineup of the New York Knights. He soon becomes the team's star player and in so doing once more attracts enigmatic woman Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) the glamorous niece of the Knights' manager Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) and the mistress of Rothstein-like gambler Gus Sands (a curiously unbilled Darren McGavin). Roy's fascination with Memo compromises his ability to play but this time he finds salvation in the form the angelic Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) his childhood sweetheart. From this point forward the script for The Natural bears very little resemblance to the Malamud original. Without giving anything away it can be said that Roy Hobbs is given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compensate for the mistakes of his youth despite the demonic intrusion of inexplicably spiteful sports writer Max Mercy (Robert Duvall). The Natural elevates the art of slow-motion photography to new heights; while this technique would become precious and boring in later baseball films it works beautifully here as does the decision by director Barry Levinson and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel to convey the symbolism inherent in the story in purely visual rather than blatantly verbal terms. (If the characters told you that the story was a retelling of the Camelot legend in baseball terms would you have watched?) Another plus is the pastoral theme music by Randy Newman which has been well utilized on sports broadcasts and "human interest" TV documentaries ever since. The baseball scenes in The Natural were staged at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo New York.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Robert Redford</DIV></DIV>

Accompanying Babs are her mother (Edith Massey) an obese and dim-witted woman who is malignly obsessed with eggs; her degenerate son Crackers (Danny Mills); and Cotton (Mary Vivian Pierce) Babs' duplicitous "traveling companion" and Crackers' co-conspirator in unwholesome erotic play. While Babs would prefer to be left in peace she takes great pride in her status as "the Filthiest Person Alive" (an honor confirmed by one of America's sleazier tabloid newspapers) and when Connie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole and David Lochary) announce their plans to take the title away from her Babs is not about to stand idly by. The Marbles are a hateful couple who kidnap women force their homosexual manservant Channing (Channing Wilroy) to impregnate them and sell the babies to lesbian couples found unfit for legal adoption; the Marbles then turn the profits back into pornography and narcotics trafficking. Impressive stuff to be sure but Babs is not about to take a back seat to anyone in a battle of filth and when the Marbles throw down the gauntlet Babs and her family retaliate in a no-holds-barred battle to determine who truly are "the Filthiest People Alive." Featuring murder bestiality rape dismemberment coprophagia a dizzying variety of sexual perversions and a performance of "Papa Oom Mow Mow" you will not soon forget Pink Flamingos is nonetheless a comedy and a surprisingly successful one; shot on a budget of only 12000 dollars the film has grossed close to ten million dollars around the world and its success launched John Waters into a career as America's leading authority on poor taste.</DIV><DIV class="tc">John Waters</DIV></DIV>

DJ (Natasha Lyonne) who narrates the picture is the daughter of divorced couple Steffi (Goldie Hawn) and Joe (Woody Allen). Since the break-up Steffi has married Bob (Alan Alda); their children DJ's half-sister and half-brother are Skyler (Drew Barrymore) and Scott (Lukas Haas). Skyler is about to be married to a likeable chap named Holden (Edward Norton). However her mother Steffi a wealthy liberal cultivates people as "projects." Her latest project is ex-con Charles (Tim Roth) an extremely rude and crude customer. At family gatherings everyone politely ignores his lapses in manners and good taste until Skyler postpones her wedding to have an affair with him. In a parallel storyline we see that DJ is convinced that her unremarried dad would find a perfect mate in Von (Julia Roberts) and she contrives an elaborate (and successful) scheme to bring them together. In a fashion typical of '30s musicals this movie completely transcends its fluffy story using a cavalcade of ballads to send the characters on a chaotic romantic merry-go-round from New York to Paris.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Woody Allen</DIV></DIV>

The title refers to the winged Aztec god Quetzalcoatl represented here as a dragon-like flying lizard (thanks to some quaint but amusing stop-motion animation from David Allen) who decides to take up residence in the art-deco spire of the Chrysler Building taking frequent jaunts in the midday sun to nip the heads off various hapless New Yorkers. The resulting bloody mess confounds detectives Shepard (David Carradine) and Powell (Richard Roundtree) who are already scratching their heads over a series of bizarre ritual murders linked to a secret Aztec cult. Into the picture comes the film's protagonist -- neurotic sweaty paranoid crook Jimmy Quinn (Michael Moriarty in a tour-de-force performance) a two-bit wheel-man with aspirations of becoming a jazz pianist. After a botched diamond heist leads Quinn to Q's lair his attempts to go straight take a side-turn as he decides to extort from the city an enormous sum in exchange for directions to the monster's nest. A few sneaky deals later the location falls into Shepard's hands and he leads a paramilitary assault on the Chrysler Building where the creature's humongous egg is about to hatch. Rude edgy fast-paced and peppered with witty dialogue (most of which can't be repeated here) Cohen's script retains the spirit of classic monster movies like The Beast from 20000 Fathoms injecting it with tough gangster-movie moxie. Moriarty's unbelievable performance -- one of three collaborations with Cohen -- finds him chewing acres of scenery as a contemptible loud-mouthed goon who's too funny to hate; Moriarty also composed and performed two schizophrenic piano numbers for the film.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Larry Cohen</DIV></DIV>

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) already on the edge is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to "Drop the Bomb.

Coppola himself was not certain either and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press the Palme d'Or-winning "work-in-progress" shown at Cannes and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself have been superbly captured in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Filmmaker's Apocalypse  </DIV></DIV>

Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelboin a schlemiel's schlemiel who works at the Skid Row flower shop of Mr. Mushnick (Mel Welles). Experimenting in his spare time Seymour develops a new plant species that he hopes will lead him to fame and fortune. Unfortunately the mutated plant -- named Audrey Junior in honor of Seymour's girlfriend Audrey (Jackie Joseph) -- subsists on blood and human flesh. It also talks or rather commands: "Feed Me! FEEEEED ME!" Before long the luckless Seymour has fed his plant the bodies of a railroad detective a sadistic dentist and a flashy trollop. Meanwhile Mr. Mushnik who has stumbled onto Seymour's secret has inadvertently offered up a burglar (played by Charles Griffith who also wrote the script and supplied the plant's voice) as a midnight snack for the voracious ever-growing Audrey Junior. (When the plant blooms the faces of its various victims are reproduced in its flowers.) Ignored on its initial release Little Shop of Horrors began building up a cult following via repeated TV exposure in the 1960s. By the mid-1970s it had attained classic status spawning a big-budget Broadway musical (and followup feature film) in the 1980s and a Saturday morning cartoon series in the 1990s.

Wong Fei Hong (Chan) is a young master of the martial art of "drunken boxing" in which fighters use alcohol to blind themselves to pain and release the angry brawler within; with the right amount of drinks under his belt Hong can become a furious one-man army. Hong accompanies his father (Ti Lung) on a voyage to China where they purchase a precious supply of ginseng. When Hong discovers thugs stealing from their luggage he leaps into action to get their belongings back. Instead he winds up with a box of valuable Chinese artifacts which criminals are hoping to smuggle to England at a tremendous profit. Hong sets out to fight the gangsters and give the artifacts back to their rightful owners but while his stepmother (Anita Mui) encourages him to use his drunken boxing skills his father feels his boozy antics bring shame to the family. Jackie Chan brought some of his most elaborate stunt work to Drunken Master 2 including a remarkable fight on a bed of hot coals; Chan also directed part of the film after Lau Kar Leung was fired after a number of disagreements with his star. Six years after it became a box office hit in Asia Drunken Master 2 earned a theatrical release in the United States; the film was re-titled Legend Of The Drunken Master (in part because the original Drunken Master never had a proper theatrical release in America) re-edited and dubbed into English with a new score by Michael Wandmacher.</DIV><DIV class="tc">2  </DIV></DIV>

Cross will stoop to unheard of levels to increase his network's ratings -- even if it means mounting outrageous programs to retain an audience such as "Robert Goulet's Cajun Christmas" and Lee Majors in "The Night the Reindeer Died" with an AK-47-toting Santa.

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) already on the edge is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to "Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all." Coppola himself was not certain either and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press the Palme d'Or-winning "work-in-progress" shown at Cannes and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette).

James Caviezel stars as Private Witt a deserter living in peace and harmony with the natives of a Pacific island paradise. Captured by the Navy Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt goes ashore in the company of his fellow soldiers they meet diverse fates. Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson) is killed by an exploding grenade. Captain John Gaff (John Cusack) is an intelligent sober leader facing the destruction of his command because his commanding officer Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) is bucking for a general's star. Sergeant McCron (John Savage) loses his mind. Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) gets a "Dear John" letter from his beloved wife. However as the U.S. troops advance up grassy slopes toward entrenched Japanese positions it is Witt's voiced-over ruminations on life death and nature that are the real heart and soul of The Thin Red Line (1998).

Tossed together for $12 million the result is a combination salad a surreal salmagundi with an added animated sequence for lagniappe. In Heaven Gabriel (Dan Hedaya) sends angels O'Reilly (Holly Hunter) and Jackson (Delroy Lindo) down to Earth to make two people fall in love. If the angels fail they must remain on Earth. The target couple: well-to-do Celine (Cameron Diaz) and impoverished aspiring novelist Robert (Ewan McGregor) a janitor at the corporation owned by her wealthy father Naville (Ian Holm). Robert loses his job kidnaps Celine and the two retreat to a mountain hideout where they discuss splitting the ransom. O'Reilly and Jackson plan to make Robert and Celine love each other by putting them in jeopardy so the two angels get hired on by Naville as bounty hunters. Although Robert and Celine argue they also sing and dance together at a local karaoke bar a scene evocative of both Dennis Potter's Karaoke and the memorable karaoke performance by Cameron Diaz in My Best Friend's Wedding. The angels make few gains but when Jackson is on the brink of killing Robert Celine comes to his rescue. Naville cancels Celine's credit card so she robs a bank. Robert is shot during the robbery and Celine has dentist Elliot (Stanley Tucci) remove the bullet. Robert awakens finds the two together and knocks out Elliot prompting an argument that leads Celine and Robert to separate.

Ebenezer Scrooge (George C. Scott) is a cynical old man whose greatest concern is money and who regards compassion as a luxury he can't afford. On Christmas Eve Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley (Frank Finlay) his former business partner who arranges for Scrooge to be visited by three spirits in an attempt to show him the error of his ways -- the Ghosts of Christmas Past (Angela Pleasence) Christmas Present (Edward Woodward) and Christmas Yet to Come (Michael Carter). The spirits force Scrooge to examine the failings of his own life as well as the bravery and optimism of his loyal but ill-treated employee Bob Crachit (David Warner).

As the title suggests Jefferson in Paris deals with the five years that Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) spent as U.S. ambassador to France prior to the French Revolution; while Jefferson is sympathetic to the revolutionary forces in France he's become well enough acquainted with the ruling aristocracy that he finds himself torn between the two sides of the issue. Jefferson a recent widower also becomes friends with Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi) who is married to a foppish British artist; while it's obvious the two are in love neither is in a position to do anything about their infatuation. And while Jefferson's daughter Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow) loves her father she's very upset with him when he sends her to a convent school. In this midst of this personal turmoil Jefferson's younger daughter Polly (Estelle Eonnet) arrives in Paris with her slave Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton) in tow. Attractive and bright (if uneducated) Sally catches Jefferson's eye and a friendship develops that grows into something deeper; in time Sally becomes pregnant and her family claims that Jefferson is the father. At the time Jefferson In Paris was released the question of Sally Hemmings' relationship with Thomas Jefferson was a matter of lively historical debate; since then genetic evidence has shown that while Jefferson's paternity can't be proved beyond a doubt it is likely that he did father children with Hemmings.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Thomas Jefferson</DIV></DIV>

Ben-Hur's Oscar haul included Best Picture Best Director for the legendary William Wyler Best Actor for Heston and Best Supporting Actor for Welsh actor Hugh Griffith as an Arab sheik.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Ben Hur</DIV></DIV>

Cross will stoop to unheard of levels to increase his network's ratings -- even if it means mounting outrageous programs to retain an audience such as "Robert Goulet's Cajun Christmas" and Lee Majors in "The Night the Reindeer Died" with an AK-47-toting Santa. Cross plots his foulest move however for the Christmas holiday when he will force his office staff to mount a live production of A Christmas Carol on national television -- and thus work through Christmas Eve. Cross's life is turned upside down with visits from three ghosts: a craggy-faced cabbie known as The Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen); the sugar-plum fairy Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane) (who gets her jollies by bonking Frank across the face with a toaster oven); and eventually the caped headless Ghost of Christmas Future who will send Frank sliding into a crematory oven -- just before he gives the sleazoid one last chance to redeem himself. Along the way the spirits carry Frank to scenes from his past present and future (per Scrooge) and impart a glimpse of how he became so thoroughly rotten.

Accompanying Babs are her mother (Edith Massey) an obese and dim-witted woman who is malignly obsessed with eggs; her degenerate son Crackers (Danny Mills); and Cotton (Mary Vivian Pierce) Babs' duplicitous "traveling companion" and Crackers' co-conspirator in unwholesome erotic play. While Babs would prefer to be left in peace she takes great pride in her status as "the Filthiest Person Alive" (an honor confirmed by one of America's sleazier tabloid newspapers) and when Connie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole and David Lochary) announce their plans to take the title away from her Babs is not about to stand idly by. The Marbles are a hateful couple who kidnap women force their homosexual manservant Channing (Channing Wilroy) to impregnate them and sell the babies to lesbian couples found unfit for legal adoption; the Marbles then turn the profits back into pornography and narcotics trafficking. Impressive stuff to be sure but Babs is not about to take a back seat to anyone in a battle of filth and when the Marbles throw down the gauntlet Babs and her family retaliate in a no-holds-barred battle to determine who truly are "the Filthiest People Alive." Featuring murder bestiality rape dismemberment coprophagia a dizzying variety of sexual perversions and a performance of "Papa Oom Mow Mow" you will not soon forget Pink Flamingos is nonetheless a comedy and a surprisingly successful one; shot on a budget of only 12000 dollars the film has grossed close to ten million dollars around the world and its success launched John Waters into a career as America's leading authority on poor taste.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Divine</DIV></DIV>

Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out "in solid" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids dispensing such construction-site advice as "Blood makes poor mortar") but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0305</DIV><DIV class="tc">ased on the Holy Scriptures with additional dialogue by several other hands The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out "in solid" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids dispensing such construction-site advice as "Blood makes poor mortar") but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner) Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. "Where's your Moses now?" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film--and who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like "Oh Moses Moses you splendid stubborn adorable fool"?</DIV><DIV class="tc">Moses</DIV></DIV>

Murnau's classic 1922 silent horror-fest Nosferatu star Klaus Kinski adopts the same makeup style used by Murnau's leading man Max Schreck. Yet in the Herzog version the crucial difference is that Nosferatu becomes more and more decayed and desiccated as the film progresses. Essentially a retelling of Bram Stoker's Dracula Nosferatu the Vampyre traces the blood-sucking progress of the count as he takes over a small German village then attempts to spread his influence and activities to the rest of the world. All that prevents Dracula from continuing his demonic practices is the self-sacrifice of Lucy Harker played by Isabelle Adjani. Director Werner Herzog used the story to parallel the rise of Nazism. The film was lensed in the Dutch towns of Delft and Scheiberg. Nosferatu the Vampyre was filmed in both an English and a German-speaking version; the latter runs 11 minutes longer.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vampyr</DIV></DIV>

To celebrate the construction of the Glass Tower the world's tallest building architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) and builder James Duncan (William Holden) hold a gala bash on the highest floors. Trouble is Duncan's son-in-law and electrical subcontractor Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain) installed faulty wiring throughout the 138-story behemoth to save money. While the guests -- including Doug's lady friend (Faye Dunaway) a rich widow (Jennifer Jones) a con man (Fred Astaire) and a politico (Robert Vaughn) -- enjoy the party and a security guard (O.J. Simpson) wonders why his equipment is on the fritz a burnt-out circuit breaker ignites some garbage on the 85th floor swiftly turning the high-rise into well a towering inferno. With the guests trapped on the 135th floor it's up to Roberts and Fire Chief O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen) to find a way to stop the blaze. Though not the first all-star '70s disaster movie (1970's Airport and 1972's The Poseidon Adventure preceded it) The Towering Inferno was the most popular and the most spectacular. In a move that would become more common in late-'90s blockbuster Hollywood The Towering Inferno's mammoth production was mounted by two studios; screenwriter Stirling Silliphant combined the two novels owned by the studios into one saga. 1970s "shake 'n bake" maestro Allen with co-director John Guillermin (Allen did the action sequences) tapped into deep fears about the fragility of modern life in the face of extreme natural phenomena as well as into the envies and insecurities of middle-aged professional men. The Towering Inferno packed theaters and earned eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture; it won for Cinematography Editing and Song. While its heroic no-nonsense men provided some traditional comfort The Towering Inferno still might provoke second thoughts about going into a skyscraper.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Airport</DIV></DIV>

Working within a tight $500000 budget director Richard Lester turned out A Hard Day's Night in a fast 6 1/2 weeks; the picture was in the theatres three months after shooting commenced. Using a variety of techniques cribbed from Hollywood slapstick comedies the French "new wave" movement and his own experiences as a TV-commercial director Lester with screenwriter Alun Owen fashioned an exhilarating study of a "typical" 36 hours in the lives of the Fab Four. Onto a plot about getting to the Big Show on time are hung a series of instant-reaction gags character vignettes and musical setpieces. Much of the humor arises from Paul McCartney's efforts to keep his grandfather (Wilfred Brambell) a "clean old man" from getting into mischief. Also good for several laughs is the hookey-playing Ringo Starr whose mistimed declaration of independence lands him in jail. We are also treated to a war of nerves between the unflappable John Lennon and an uptight TV director (Victor Spinelli) who worries that should the Beatles not show up at broadcast time he'll be demoted to "News In Welsh." George Harrison stars in a sequence in which he is mistaken for an auditionee by the producer (Kenneth Haigh) of a superficially trendy teen-oriented TV weekly. Then there's Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers who carry on a battle royale simply because one man is taller than the other. The supporting cast includes comedienne Anna Quayle cartoonist Bob Godfrey TV host Robin Ray dancer Lionel Blair Harrison's future wife Patti Boyd and director Lester himself. The songs include "I Should Have Known Better" "And I Love Her" "Tell Me Why" "If I Fell" "Can't Buy Me Love" and the title song.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Richard Lester</DIV></DIV>

Allen plays Boris a 19th century Russian who falls in love with his distant (and married) cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton). Pressed into service with the Russian army during the war against Napoleon Boris accidentally becomes a hero then goes on to win a duel against a cuckolded husband (Harold Gould). He returns to Sonja hoping to settle down on the Steppes somewhere but Sonja has become fired up with patriotic fervor insisting that Boris join a plot to kill Napoleon. Intellectual in-jokes abound in Love and Death and other gags are basic Allen one-liners; for instance after being congratulated for his lovemaking skills Boris replies nonchalantly "I practice a lot when I'm alone." The pseudo-Russian ambience of Love and Death is comically enhanced by the Sergey Prokofiev compositions on the musical track.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Woody Allen</DIV></DIV>

The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Christopher Walken Eric Stoltz Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Quentin Tarantino</DIV></DIV>

Every 100 years the people of Brigadoon awaken for a 24-hour period then go back to sleep for another century while Brigadoon itself vanishes in the mists. Tommy Albright (Kelly) falls in love with village lass Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse) while his hard-drinking pal Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) dismisses the legend -- and indeed the existence of Brigadoon as a result of delirium. Fiona's betrothed Harry Beaton (Hugh Laing) upset by Kelly's intervention threatens to leave Brigadoon -- an act that will spell doom for its residents. When this crisis has passed Tommy is persuaded against his better judgment to escape Brigadoon himself and return to his own fiancée (Elaine Stewart) in New York. But the love between Tommy and Fiona results in a miraculous finale. Most of the Lerner-Loewe score remains intact including the hit songs "Almost Like Being in Love" "Heather on the Hill" and "Come to Me Bend to Me."</DIV><DIV class="tc">Vincente Minnelli</DIV></DIV>

Three generations of women who share the same name -- 63-year-old Cissie Colpitts (Joan Plowright) her daughter Cissie Colpitts II (Juliet Stevenson) and granddaughter Cissie Colpitts III (Joely Richardson) -- have all discovered the same way of dealing with their marital problems. The senior Cissie has drowned her husband Jake (Bryan Pringle) in the bathtub her daughter sent her spouse Hardy (Trevor Cooper) to a watery grave in the ocean and the youngest Cissie sent her husband Bellamy (David Morrissey) down in a swimming pool. Needless to say local coroner Henry Madgett (Barnard Hill) has some questions about this sudden rash of drownings among the Colpitts husbands and again all three women respond in the same way: they promise to sleep with Henry in exchange for recording the deaths as accidental (though none of the Cissies make good on this promise).

There is slightly more of a plot this time though it is a patently ridiculous one: a sacred ruby ring comes into Ringo's possession attracting the unwelcome attention of an exotic religious cult and forcing the boys to go on the run. This chase narrative is thankfully never taken too seriously serving mainly as an excuse for colorful excursions to international locations from Europe to the Bahamas. The musical numbers include such classic tunes as "Ticket to Ride" "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" and of course "Help!".</DIV><DIV class="tc">Richard Lester</DIV></DIV>

One the marriage of Fred Astaire's sister Adele to a British nobleman had occurred years earlier; the other the wedding of England's Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip was only four years in the past. MGM would probably have gotten Royal Wedding out closer to the Elizabeth-Philip nuptials but the picture had leading-lady problems; every girl who was cast either became pregnant ill or otherwise unavailable. Finally Jane Powell was cast as the sister and partner of American-entertainer Fred Astaire. The plot has Astaire and Powell heading to Merrie Olde England to perform at the palace. Once they've arrived Powell breaks up the act when she falls in love with blueblooded Peter Lawford. Astaire himself finds romance in the form of Sarah Churchill (daughter of Sir Winston) and the four happy campers gleefully attend the titular Windsor Castle wedding. Also in the cast is Albert Sharpe fresh from his Broadway triumph in Finian's Rainbow and Keenan Wynn hilarious as twin cousins. The plot is so light that it threatens to float away at times but Royal Wedding sticks in the memory thanks to its first-rate musical numbers. The Astaire/Powell duets are entertaining enough; the real magic however occurs in Astaire's two solos: the hat-rack duet and the now-legendary tap-dance on the ceiling (even knowing how this cinematic legerdemain was accomplished does not detract from its brilliance and virtuosity). Because it has slipped into public domain Royal Wedding is one of the most easily accessible of all the Fred Astaire musicals.</DIV><DIV class="tc">1951 ,</DIV></DIV>

Holly Hunter stars as Wanda Holloway a twice-married Baptist mother of two who becomes obsessed when her daughter Shanna (Frankie Ingrassia) gets disqualified from the election for the eighth-grade cheerleading squad because of overly manipulative campaign tactics (i.e. handing out free rulers imprinted with her name). Looking down her nose at neighbor Verna Heath (Elizabeth Ruscio) whose daughter Amber (Megan Berwick) made the squad Wanda becomes convinced that there's a conspiracy afoot and decides to do something about it. Getting in touch with her ex-husband's brother Terry Harper (Beau Bridges) -- a lowlife with a liquor and drug habit and a wife (Swoosie Kurtz) who sees imaginary creatures on the floor -- Wanda all but orders him to find her an assassin on the cheap. Terry chickens out contacts the police and helps get the goods on his former sister-in-law before she can do any actual damage. A media circus soon engulfs the participants' small Texas town as Wanda heads to court and tries to prove she was the victim of a setup. Set against the backdrop of the Gulf War and the fall of communism The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom was filmed for HBO by Bad News Bears and Smile director Michael Ritchie.

The partygoers include his ex-wife Leeanne (Famke Janssen) the mother of his two children; his law partner Lois Harlan (Daryl Hannah); and caterer Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz). After Mallory finds her car stolen Rick gives her a ride home where things turn sexual. Attracted to Mallory he learns that her crazed father Dixon Doss (Robert Duvall) has been threatening her. Getting too closely involved with this woman he hardly knows Rick has the police round up her unstable father and he next subpoenas her ex-husband Pete (Tom Berenger) to testify against Dixon who is institutionalized. The crazed Dixon manages to escape from the asylum intent on revenge against all his betrayers and enemies. As a potent hurricane blows into Savannah Mallory's car is torched and Rick receives threats. Believing his children are in danger Rick removes them from school prompting a warrant for his arrest. When his children disappear Rich goes on the counterattack against Dixon. Chinese cinematographer Changwei Gu (of Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine and Zhang Yimou's Ju Dou) captured the soaked Savannah sites. The script is not an adaptation from a John Grisham novel; Grisham wrote it as an original screenplay just before the success of The Firm (1993) and it was acquired by producer Jeremy Tannenbaum. After Island Pictures came into the project at $1.4 million Grisham returned for rewrites. Altman did even more drafts so the pseudonym Al Hayes was created as the scripting credit. When Polygram suggested to Altman that the electronic score could be replaced with a traditional score Altman had friends call reporters to say he had been dismissed. Polygram began re-editing the $25 million movie but their edit didn't test much better than Altman's version so they handed the reins back to Altman.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Robert Altman</DIV></DIV>

Heinlein's 1959 novel originally serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (October-November 1959). After graduation Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) volunteers for the Mobile Infantry to do his Federal service -- but also to win over his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) who has signed with the Fleet Academy to become a starship pilot. Johnny joins other boot-camp recruits -- Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) who has had a crush on Johnny since school and Ace Levy (Jake Busey). Ace and Johnny become pals and Johnny's abilities earn him the squad leader position. A training accident occurs on Johnny's watch and he is about to resign when Earth is attacked by alien insects intent on eradicating all human life. Johnny's home Buenos Aires is no longer on the map. Horrified he chooses to stay on and fight to destroy the insect threat. The Mobile Infantry travels to the planet Klendathu to battle the warrior bugs a ruthless enemy with only one goal -- survival of their species no matter what. In the initial encounter some 100000 lives are lost. At a distant fort Johnny's unit discovers that the bugs drain brains to acquire knowledge. Soon they are overwhelmed by an advancing arthropod army of immense proportions attacking both in space and on the planet surface. The notion of human extinction becomes a possibility. For this $100-million production some 300 artists and technicians combined models and miniatures with CGI effects to fashion a variety of creatures -- from breeder bugs to armored tanker bugs. The film employed hundreds of extras and has over 500 visual effects shots. Filming began 4/29/96 in California (LA and Long Beach where Cal State's pyramid gym was used for the Jumpball game) New York South Dakota Wyoming (Casper Hell's Half Acre) and Utah (an abandoned Wendover airstrip where the Enola Gay WWII bomber crew trained). At an abandoned airfield in Fountain Valley California an elaborate set was constructed to resemble a military boot camp of the future -- complete with an array of pup tents gull-winged spaceships hurdle obstacle course and training facility buildings.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0077</DIV><DIV class="tc">Woody Allen's Love and Death is purportedly a satire of all things Russian from Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky novels to Sergei Eisenstein films but it plays more like a spin on Bob Hope's Monsieur Beaucaire. Allen plays Boris a 19th century Russian who falls in love with his distant (and married) cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton). Pressed into service with the Russian army during the war against Napoleon Boris accidentally becomes a hero then goes on to win a duel against a cuckolded husband (Harold Gould). He returns to Sonja hoping to settle down on the Steppes somewhere but Sonja has become fired up with patriotic fervor insisting that Boris join a plot to kill Napoleon. Intellectual in-jokes abound in Love and Death and other gags are basic Allen one-liners; for instance after being congratulated for his lovemaking skills Boris replies nonchalantly "I practice a lot when I'm alone." The pseudo-Russian ambience of Love and Death is comically enhanced by the Sergey Prokofiev compositions on the musical track.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Monsieur Beaucaire  </DIV></DIV>

The crux of the film is the staunchly Catholic More's refusal to acknowledge King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw)'s break from the church to divorce his first wife and marry Anne Boleyn (an unbilled Vanessa Redgrave). Sir Thomas willingly goes to the chopping block rather than sacrifice his ideals. Director Fred Zinnemann retains the play's verbosity without sacrificing the film's strong sense of visuals. The impeccably chosen cast includes Wendy Hiller as Sir Thomas' likably contentious wife Alice John Hurt as the deceitful Richard Rich (More's put-downs of this despicable character provide some of the film's biggest laughs) Orson Welles as a dour Cardinal Woolsey Leo McKern as the ambitious Thomas Cromwell and Susannah York as More's daughter Margaret. The "Common Man" an important bridging-the-scenes character in the original play is removed from the film version which does just fine without him. A Man for All Seasons won six Oscars including Best Picture Best Director and Best Actor as well as seven British Film Academy awards.</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Man for All Seasons  </DIV></DIV>

In True Grit Wayne plays grumpy pot-bellied U.S. marshal "Rooster" Cogburn hired by 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) to find Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey) who killed her father. The headstrong Mattie could have had her pick of lawmen but selects the aging Cogburn because she believes he has "true grit" (she talks this way all through the picture so be prepared). Also heading into Indian territory in search of Chaney is Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) who wants to collect the reward placed on the fugitive's head for his earlier crimes. Complicating matters are Chaney's scurrilous cronies Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall) Quincy (Jeremy Slate) and Moon (Dennis Hopper) who have no qualms about killing a troublesome teenaged girl like Mattie. While the plot of True Grit adapted (and streamlined) by Marguerite Roberts from the novel by Charles Portis maintains audience interest throughout the glue that truly holds this Western together is John Wayne delivering one of his finest performances (though some believe he was better in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon). Wayne's casual charisma is infinitely more effective than the mannered method acting of Kim Darby and the floundering non-acting of poor Glen Campbell. And who could not love the climatic face-off between Duvall and company and John Wayne whose "Fill your hand you son of a bitch!" is not only a classic bit of dialogue but the apotheosis of the Wayne mystique. In 1975 Wayne repeated his True Grit characterization opposite Katharine Hepburn in Rooster Cogburn but the film failed to match its predecessor and the overall effect was blunted.</DIV><DIV class="tc">True Grit  </DIV></DIV>

Heinlein's 1959 novel originally serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (October-November 1959). After graduation Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) volunteers for the Mobile Infantry to do his Federal service -- but also to win over his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) who has signed with the Fleet Academy to become a starship pilot. Johnny joins other boot-camp recruits -- Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) who has had a crush on Johnny since school and Ace Levy (Jake Busey). Ace and Johnny become pals and Johnny's abilities earn him the squad leader position. A training accident occurs on Johnny's watch and he is about to resign when Earth is attacked by alien insects intent on eradicating all human life. Johnny's home Buenos Aires is no longer on the map. Horrified he chooses to stay on and fight to destroy the insect threat. The Mobile Infantry travels to the planet Klendathu to battle the warrior bugs a ruthless enemy with only one goal -- survival of their species no matter what. In the initial encounter some 100000 lives are lost. At a distant fort Johnny's unit discovers that the bugs drain brains to acquire knowledge. Soon they are overwhelmed by an advancing arthropod army of immense proportions attacking both in space and on the planet surface. The notion of human extinction becomes a possibility. For this $100-million production some 300 artists and technicians combined models and miniatures with CGI effects to fashion a variety of creatures -- from breeder bugs to armored tanker bugs. The film employed hundreds of extras and has over 500 visual effects shots. Filming began 4/29/96 in California (LA and Long Beach where Cal State's pyramid gym was used for the Jumpball game) New York South Dakota Wyoming (Casper Hell's Half Acre) and Utah (an abandoned Wendover airstrip where the Enola Gay WWII bomber crew trained).

Hfuhruhurr pioneered the radical new cranial screw-top technique but he grieves over the untimely death of his wife Rebecca carrying around a small plastic likeness of her to get through the long and lonely evenings. Thinking of her while driving home Hfuhruhurr takes his eyes off the road and runs down the beautiful but deadly Dolores Benedict (Kathleen Turner). Hfuhruhurr performs surgery which saves her life but as she recovers Hfuhruhurr doesn't realize Dolores is a gold-digging vixen who has driven her latest husband (George Furth) to death by apoplexy. She is now looking for a new victim and Hfuhruhurr fits the bill. They marry but Dolores denies her husband sexual favors which frustrates Hfuhruhurr to distraction. He takes Dolores on a belated honeymoon to Austria where he meets fellow brain surgeon Dr. Necessiter (David Warner) who keeps a wide assortment of brains in his laboratory. Dolores takes the opportunity to have an extramarital affair and when Hfuhruhurr finds out he dumps her. But in Necessiter's laboratory Hfuhruhurr becomes attracted to Brain #21 Ann Uumellmahaye (voice of Sissy Spacek) with whom he communicates telepathically. At last here is one case where a man loves a woman for her mind rather than her body (which doesn't exist)! But Ann's brain is deteriorating rapidly; Hfuhruhurr needs to find a body and transplant the brain quickly in order to save Ann.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Carl Reiner</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">1730</DIV><DIV class="tc">Peter Greenaway wrote and directed this typically surreal and iconoclastic black comedy. Three generations of women who share the same name -- 63-year-old Cissie Colpitts (Joan Plowright) her daughter Cissie Colpitts II (Juliet Stevenson) and granddaughter Cissie Colpitts III (Joely Richardson) -- have all discovered the same way of dealing with their marital problems. The senior Cissie has drowned her husband Jake (Bryan Pringle) in the bathtub her daughter sent her spouse Hardy (Trevor Cooper) to a watery grave in the ocean and the youngest Cissie sent her husband Bellamy (David Morrissey) down in a swimming pool. Needless to say local coroner Henry Madgett (Barnard Hill) has some questions about this sudden rash of drownings among the Colpitts husbands and again all three women respond in the same way: they promise to sleep with Henry in exchange for recording the deaths as accidental (though none of the Cissies make good on this promise). When the local gossip mill begins working overtime about this sudden rash of water-related deaths Henry's teenage son Smut (Jason Edwards) comes to the aid of the Cissies and organizes a tug-of-war with he and the Colpitts women on one side and the doubting townspeople on the other (and of course a river in the middle). Along the way Greenaway often stops to contemplate his obsessions with literature astronomy and numbers. Drowning by Numbers was released in Europe in 1988 but didn't find its way to American screens until 1991 following the success of Greenaway's The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Peter Greenaway</DIV></DIV>

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0305</DIV><DIV class="tc">ased on the Holy Scriptures with additional dialogue by several other hands The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out "in solid" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids dispensing such construction-site advice as "Blood makes poor mortar") but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner) Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. "Where's your Moses now?" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film--and who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like "Oh Moses Moses you splendid stubborn adorable fool"?</DIV><DIV class="tc">Moses  </DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0465</DIV><DIV class="tc">This groundbreaking darkly comic horror film from director Joe Dante changed the look and feel of werewolf movies in ways light-years distant from Universal's horror classic The Wolf Man. The story begins with television reporter/anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) taking part in a dangerous police operation intended to trap psychopath Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). When confronted by Eddie face to face she witnesses something horrifying enough to trigger selective amnesia. Plagued by a series of violent nightmares Karen decides to admit herself to a posh recovery resort known only as "The Colony" run by her eccentric New Age therapist Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee) and brings along her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) for support. The night after they arrive Karen and Bill are unnerved by eerie howling in the woods. Back in the city Karen's co-workers Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) have been investigating Eddie's background after discovering that his body has disappeared from the morgue.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0305</DIV><DIV class="tc">ased on the Holy Scriptures with additional dialogue by several other hands The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter to his long hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out "in solid" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids dispensing such construction-site advice as "Blood makes poor mortar") but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner) Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile the Hebrews led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. "Where's your Moses now?" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to film--and who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like "Oh Moses Moses you splendid stubborn adorable fool"?</DIV><DIV class="tc">Moses</DIV></DIV>

The story begins with television reporter/anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) taking part in a dangerous police operation intended to trap psychopath Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). When confronted by Eddie face to face she witnesses something horrifying enough to trigger selective amnesia. Plagued by a series of violent nightmares Karen decides to admit herself to a posh recovery resort known only as "The Colony" run by her eccentric New Age therapist Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee) and brings along her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) for support. The night after they arrive Karen and Bill are unnerved by eerie howling in the woods. Back in the city Karen's co-workers Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) have been investigating Eddie's background after discovering that his body has disappeared from the morgue. Sifting through Eddie's possessions they find a strange collection of artwork depicting wolf-like creatures and decide to consult with Walter Paisley (Dick Miller of course) the owner of an occult bookshop on werewolf lore. Though he claims not to believe in the stuff he's selling Paisley nevertheless convinces Chris to purchase a handful of silver bullets...just in case.

Carla occasionally is short of money for her fare so George lets he ride for free; when his boss finds out about this it's added to a list of small insubordinations and George is fired. However he stays in touch with Carla and learns she's a good bit more troubled than he imagined. She's given to dramatic mood swings and has attempted suicide and in time he learns that her emotional problems stem from the disappearance and probable death of her boyfriend Antonio (Richard Loza) a Sandinista who is believed to have been kidnapped by the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The largely apolitical George travels with Carla to Nicaragua to help her look for Antonio. In their travels they meet Bradley (Scott Glenn) an American who was once a CIA "advisor" to the Contra who has turned his back on their policies and now works alongside the Sandinistas.

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Sweet Hereafter</DIV></DIV>

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Breaking the Waves</DIV></DIV>

Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Chungking Express</DIV></DIV>

He is so unswervingly devoted to serving his master a well-meaning but callow British lord (James Fox) that he shuts himself off from all emotions and familial relationships. New housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) tries to warm him up and awaken his humanity. But when duty calls Stevens won't even attend his own dying father's last moments on earth. The butler also refuses to acknowledge the fact that his master is showing signs of pro-Nazi sentiments. Disillusioned by Hitler's duplicity the master dies an embittered man and only then does Stevens come to realize how his own silence has helped bring about this sad situation. Years later regretting his lost opportunities in life he tries once more to make contact with Miss Kenton the only person who'd ever cared enough to seek out the human being inside the butler's cold veneer.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Remains of the Day</DIV></DIV>

John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships.

Pather Panchali (1955) covered Apu's early years in his native village while Aparajito (1956) detailed his school years and the tragedy that temporarily brought him back home. Now Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) having abandoned college due to lack of money hopes to find success as a writer. He is sidetracked from this goal when he meets Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) whose impending wedding is canceled when the groom turns out to be mentally unstable. To save Aparna from a custom-dictated life of spinsterhood Apu marries her himself. When she dies giving birth the grieving Apu cannot bring himself to meet his son and in fact deserts the boy for five years before learning how to gracefully accept his lot in life.

Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti a mother of three whose husband Nick (Peter Falk) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous extroverted and fragile while he's controlling distant and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence. Like its title heroine the film threatens to veer out of control at any time its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship from seismic bursts of high drama to small even trivial moments of domestic tedium its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly illuminating and frustrating and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Woman Under the Influence</DIV></DIV>

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Taxi Driver</DIV></DIV>

Travolta plays Tony Manero a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including "Stayin' Alive") we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan.

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Sweet Hereafter</DIV></DIV>

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Breaking the Waves</DIV></DIV>

Anthony Hopkins plays Stevens the "perfect" butler to a prosperous British household of the 1930s. He is so unswervingly devoted to serving his master a well-meaning but callow British lord (James Fox) that he shuts himself off from all emotions and familial relationships. New housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) tries to warm him up and awaken his humanity. But when duty calls Stevens won't even attend his own dying father's last moments on earth. The butler also refuses to acknowledge the fact that his master is showing signs of pro-Nazi sentiments. Disillusioned by Hitler's duplicity the master dies an embittered man and only then does Stevens come to realize how his own silence has helped bring about this sad situation. Years later regretting his lost opportunities in life he tries once more to make contact with Miss Kenton the only person who'd ever cared enough to seek out the human being inside the butler's cold veneer.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Remains of the Day</DIV></DIV>

John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships. Together with Quentin Tarantino's very different Pulp Fiction (1994) sex lies and videotape was one of the most influential movies for independent filmmaking of the 1990s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">sex , lies , and videotape</DIV></DIV>

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Taxi Driver</DIV></DIV>

Travolta plays Tony Manero a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including "Stayin' Alive") we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978 when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie.

<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0015</DIV><DIV class="tc">Director Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was touted at the time of its release (successfully if the box-office receipts are any indication) as something of a "youth trip" movie. This is because Zeffirelli broke the long-standing tradition of casting over-aged sometimes grey-haired players in the title roles. Seventeen-year-old Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey as Juliet. The youthfulness and inexperience of the leading players works beautifully in the more passionate sequences (some of these breaking further ground by being played in the nude). Among the younger players are Michael York as Tybalt and John McEnery as Mercutio. The duel between Romeo and Tybalt starts out as a harmless frat-boy exchange of insults then escalates into tragedy before any of the participants are fully aware of what has happened. Photographed by Pasqualino DeSantis on various locations in Italy Romeo and Juliet was one of the most profitable film adaptations of Shakespeare ever produced. Its most lasting legacy is its popular main theme music composed by Nino Rota.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Romeo and Juliet</DIV></DIV>

A once-promising pugilist Rocky is now taking nickel-and-dime bouts and running strongarm errands for local loan sharks to survive. Even his supportive trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has given up on Rocky. All this changes thanks to Muhammad Ali-like super-boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). With the Bicentennial celebration coming up Creed must find a "Cinderella" opponent for the big July 4th bout -- some unknown whom Creed can "glorify" for a few minutes before knocking him cold. Rocky Balboa was not the only Cinderella involved here: writer/director Sylvester Stallone himself a virtual unknown managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone this was a make-or-break opportunity -- just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards including Best Picture.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Rocky</DIV></DIV>

Lena Younger (Claudia McNeil) is a strong proud woman who has raised a family in a crowded apartment on the South Side of Chicago. Her son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier) works as a chauffeur; intelligent and ambitious but impulsive and often angry he desperately wants to get ahead in a world that offers him few opportunities. His wife Ruth (Ruby Dee) takes in laundry to help make ends meet and watches over their son. Younger daughter Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a college student who wants to become a doctor and often speaks of searching for her cultural identity. On the death of her husband Lena becomes the beneficiary of a $10000 life insurance payment and suddenly the family is in conflict over how the money should be spent. Lena wants to use the money for a down payment on a house. Beneatha is hoping that Lena will help her pay for medical school. And Walter Lee wants to go into business with friends who plan to open a liquor store which he's convinced will be a sure money maker. The cast nearly all reprising their roles from the original Broadway production offers a collection of superb performances; also keep an eye peeled for a young Louis Gossett Jr. as George Murchison. While Daniel Petrie's direction never takes A Raisin in the Sun very far from its roots as a stage play it captures the power and tension of a strong ensemble cast working with an intelligent and moving script.</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Raisin in the Sun</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0019</DIV><DIV class="tc">Martin Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability (and desire) to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act the film flashes back to 1940s New York when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob however will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) but success does nothing to exorcise his demons even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey and disastrously gaining weight Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom however Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: "I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody." Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations it underperformed at the box office as audiences increasingly turned away from "difficult" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar as did the film's editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Raging Bull</DIV></DIV>

Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D &amp; D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened but didn't Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission. Featuring Brando's famous "I coulda been a contendah" speech On the Waterfront has often been seen as an allegory of "naming names" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s. Director Elia Kazan famously informed on suspected Communists before a government committee -- unlike many of his colleagues some of whom went to prison for refusing to "name names" and many more of whom were blacklisted from working in the film industry for many years to come -- and Budd Schulberg's screenplay has often been read as an elaborate defense of the informer's position. On the Waterfront won Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actor for Brando and Best Supporting Actress for Saint.</DIV><DIV class="tc">On the Waterfront</DIV></DIV>

Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978 when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970s disco culture. Two versions of this film exist: the original R-rated version and a PG version edited down to more "family-friendly" fare and fed to the public with the tagline "Because we want everyone to see John Travolta's performance."</DIV><DIV class="tc">Saturday Night Fever</DIV></DIV>

This is because Zeffirelli broke the long-standing tradition of casting over-aged sometimes grey-haired players in the title roles. Seventeen-year-old Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey as Juliet. The youthfulness and inexperience of the leading players works beautifully in the more passionate sequences (some of these breaking further ground by being played in the nude). Among the younger players are Michael York as Tybalt and John McEnery as Mercutio. The duel between Romeo and Tybalt starts out as a harmless frat-boy exchange of insults then escalates into tragedy before any of the participants are fully aware of what has happened. Photographed by Pasqualino DeSantis on various locations in Italy Romeo and Juliet was one of the most profitable film adaptations of Shakespeare ever produced. Its most lasting legacy is its popular main theme music composed by Nino Rota.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Romeo and Juliet</DIV></DIV>

A once-promising pugilist Rocky is now taking nickel-and-dime bouts and running strongarm errands for local loan sharks to survive. Even his supportive trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has given up on Rocky. All this changes thanks to Muhammad Ali-like super-boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). With the Bicentennial celebration coming up Creed must find a "Cinderella" opponent for the big July 4th bout -- some unknown whom Creed can "glorify" for a few minutes before knocking him cold. Rocky Balboa was not the only Cinderella involved here: writer/director Sylvester Stallone himself a virtual unknown managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone this was a make-or-break opportunity -- just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards including Best Picture.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Rocky</DIV></DIV>

Lena Younger (Claudia McNeil) is a strong proud woman who has raised a family in a crowded apartment on the South Side of Chicago. Her son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier) works as a chauffeur; intelligent and ambitious but impulsive and often angry he desperately wants to get ahead in a world that offers him few opportunities. His wife Ruth (Ruby Dee) takes in laundry to help make ends meet and watches over their son. Younger daughter Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a college student who wants to become a doctor and often speaks of searching for her cultural identity. On the death of her husband Lena becomes the beneficiary of a $10000 life insurance payment and suddenly the family is in conflict over how the money should be spent. Lena wants to use the money for a down payment on a house. Beneatha is hoping that Lena will help her pay for medical school. And Walter Lee wants to go into business with friends who plan to open a liquor store which he's convinced will be a sure money maker. The cast nearly all reprising their roles from the original Broadway production offers a collection of superb performances; also keep an eye peeled for a young Louis Gossett Jr. as George Murchison. While Daniel Petrie's direction never takes A Raisin in the Sun very far from its roots as a stage play it captures the power and tension of a strong ensemble cast working with an intelligent and moving script.</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Raisin in the Sun</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:35 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0019</DIV><DIV class="tc">Martin Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability (and desire) to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act the film flashes back to 1940s New York when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob however will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) but success does nothing to exorcise his demons even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey and disastrously gaining weight Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom however Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: "I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody." Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations it underperformed at the box office as audiences increasingly turned away from "difficult" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar as did the film's editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Raging Bull</DIV></DIV>

Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D &amp; D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened but didn't Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission. Featuring Brando's famous "I coulda been a contendah" speech On the Waterfront has often been seen as an allegory of "naming names" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s. Director Elia Kazan famously informed on suspected Communists before a government committee -- unlike many of his colleagues some of whom went to prison for refusing to "name names" and many more of whom were blacklisted from working in the film industry for many years to come -- and Budd Schulberg's screenplay has often been read as an elaborate defense of the informer's position. On the Waterfront won Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actor for Brando and Best Supporting Actress for Saint.</DIV><DIV class="tc">On the Waterfront</DIV></DIV>

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Sweet Hereafter</DIV></DIV>

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Breaking the Waves</DIV></DIV>

Anthony Hopkins plays Stevens the "perfect" butler to a prosperous British household of the 1930s. He is so unswervingly devoted to serving his master a well-meaning but callow British lord (James Fox) that he shuts himself off from all emotions and familial relationships. New housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) tries to warm him up and awaken his humanity. But when duty calls Stevens won't even attend his own dying father's last moments on earth. The butler also refuses to acknowledge the fact that his master is showing signs of pro-Nazi sentiments. Disillusioned by Hitler's duplicity the master dies an embittered man and only then does Stevens come to realize how his own silence has helped bring about this sad situation. Years later regretting his lost opportunities in life he tries once more to make contact with Miss Kenton the only person who'd ever cared enough to seek out the human being inside the butler's cold veneer.</DIV><DIV class="tc">The Remains of the Day</DIV></DIV>

John (Peter Gallagher) is an unscrupulous self-centered yuppie lawyer with a beautiful wife named Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships. Together with Quentin Tarantino's very different Pulp Fiction (1994) sex lies and videotape was one of the most influential movies for independent filmmaking of the 1990s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">sex , lies , and videotape</DIV></DIV>

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Taxi Driver</DIV></DIV>

Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality.

In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works the nightshift driving his cab throughout decaying mid-'70s New York City wishing for a "real rain" to wash the "scum" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Taxi Driver</DIV></DIV>

Travolta plays Tony Manero a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including "Stayin' Alive") we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978 when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970s disco culture. Two versions of this film exist: the original R-rated version and a PG version edited down to more "family-friendly" fare and fed to the public with the tagline "Because we want everyone to see John Travolta's performance."</DIV><DIV class="tc">Saturday Night Fever</DIV></DIV>

This is because Zeffirelli broke the long-standing tradition of casting over-aged sometimes grey-haired players in the title roles. Seventeen-year-old Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey as Juliet. The youthfulness and inexperience of the leading players works beautifully in the more passionate sequences (some of these breaking further ground by being played in the nude). Among the younger players are Michael York as Tybalt and John McEnery as Mercutio. The duel between Romeo and Tybalt starts out as a harmless frat-boy exchange of insults then escalates into tragedy before any of the participants are fully aware of what has happened. Photographed by Pasqualino DeSantis on various locations in Italy Romeo and Juliet was one of the most profitable film adaptations of Shakespeare ever produced. Its most lasting legacy is its popular main theme music composed by Nino Rota.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Romeo and Juliet</DIV></DIV>

A once-promising pugilist Rocky is now taking nickel-and-dime bouts and running strongarm errands for local loan sharks to survive. Even his supportive trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has given up on Rocky. All this changes thanks to Muhammad Ali-like super-boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). With the Bicentennial celebration coming up Creed must find a "Cinderella" opponent for the big July 4th bout -- some unknown whom Creed can "glorify" for a few minutes before knocking him cold. Rocky Balboa was not the only Cinderella involved here: writer/director Sylvester Stallone himself a virtual unknown managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone this was a make-or-break opportunity -- just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards including Best Picture.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Rocky</DIV></DIV>

Lena Younger (Claudia McNeil) is a strong proud woman who has raised a family in a crowded apartment on the South Side of Chicago. Her son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier) works as a chauffeur; intelligent and ambitious but impulsive and often angry he desperately wants to get ahead in a world that offers him few opportunities. His wife Ruth (Ruby Dee) takes in laundry to help make ends meet and watches over their son. Younger daughter Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a college student who wants to become a doctor and often speaks of searching for her cultural identity. On the death of her husband Lena becomes the beneficiary of a $10000 life insurance payment and suddenly the family is in conflict over how the money should be spent. Lena wants to use the money for a down payment on a house. Beneatha is hoping that Lena will help her pay for medical school. And Walter Lee wants to go into business with friends who plan to open a liquor store which he's convinced will be a sure money maker. The cast nearly all reprising their roles from the original Broadway production offers a collection of superb performances; also keep an eye peeled for a young Louis Gossett Jr. as George Murchison. While Daniel Petrie's direction never takes A Raisin in the Sun very far from its roots as a stage play it captures the power and tension of a strong ensemble cast working with an intelligent and moving script.</DIV><DIV class="tc">A Raisin in the Sun</DIV></DIV>

Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act the film flashes back to 1940s New York when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob however will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) but success does nothing to exorcise his demons even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey and disastrously gaining weight Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom however Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: "I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody." Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations it underperformed at the box office as audiences increasingly turned away from "difficult" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar as did the film's editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Raging Bull</DIV></DIV>

Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) rules the waterfront with an iron fist. The police know that he's been responsible for a number of murders but witnesses play deaf and dumb ("plead D &amp; D"). Washed-up boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) has had an errand-boy job because of the influence of his brother Charley a crooked union lawyer (Rod Steiger). Witnessing one of Friendly's rub-outs Terry is willing to keep his mouth shut until he meets the dead dockworker's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint). "Waterfront priest" Father Barry (Karl Malden) tells Terry that Edie's brother was killed because he was going to testify against boss Friendly before the crime commission. Because he could have intervened but didn't Terry feels somewhat responsible for the death. When Father Barry receives a beating from Friendly's goons Terry is persuaded to cooperate with the commission. Featuring Brando's famous "I coulda been a contendah" speech On the Waterfront has often been seen as an allegory of "naming names" against suspected Communists during the anti-Communist investigations of the 1950s. Director Elia Kazan famously informed on suspected Communists before a government committee -- unlike many of his colleagues some of whom went to prison for refusing to "name names" and many more of whom were blacklisted from working in the film industry for many years to come -- and Budd Schulberg's screenplay has often been read as an elaborate defense of the informer's position. On the Waterfront won Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay Best Actor for Brando and Best Supporting Actress for Saint.</DIV><DIV class="tc">On the Waterfront</DIV></DIV>

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead. Ian Holm stars as Mitchell Stephens a big-city lawyer who arrives in the interest of uniting the survivors to initiate a lawsuit; his maneuvering only drives the community further apart reopening old wounds and jeopardizing any hopes of emotional recovery. Like so many of Egoyan's features The Sweet Hereafter is a serious and painfully honest exploration of family grief; no character is immune from the sense of utter devastation which grips the film not even the attorney whose interests are in part motivated by his own remorse over the fate of his daughter an HIV-positive drug addict.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿The Sweet Hereafter ></DIV></DIV>

For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex.

Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿Chungking Express ></DIV></DIV>

Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti a mother of three whose husband Nick (Peter Falk) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous extroverted and fragile while he's controlling distant and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence. Like its title heroine the film threatens to veer out of control at any time its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship from seismic bursts of high drama to small even trivial moments of domestic tedium its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly illuminating and frustrating and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿A Woman Under the Influence ></DIV></DIV>

After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences a study of individual psychosis and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent media-fixated Vietnam era. Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956) aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt as well as Palatine's political platitudes also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses expressive camera moves and angles and garish colors all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died) Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view where De Niro's now-famous "You talkin' to me" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. Released in the Bicentennial year after Vietnam Watergate and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of "God's lonely man" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿Taxi Driver ></DIV></DIV>

Travolta plays Tony Manero a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another (including "Stayin' Alive") we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978 when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970s disco culture. Two versions of this film exist: the original R-rated version and a PG version edited down to more "family-friendly" fare and fed to the public with the tagline "Because we want everyone to see John Travolta's performance."</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿Saturday Night Fever ></DIV></DIV>

Restructured to fit Egoyan's signature mosaic narrative style the story concerns the cultural aftershocks which tear apart a small British Columbia town in the wake of a school-bus accident which leaves a number of local children dead.

Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson) is a naïve borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). For a brief time the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig however where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan constantly medicated and profoundly depressed asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess on the other hand sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess' resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking the Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s marking von Trier's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life filmed without background music and with a hand-held restlessly moving camera.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿Breaking the Waves</DIV></DIV>

Director Wong Kar-Wai plays freely with traditional narrative structure dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a depressed cop struggling to come to terms with a recent break-up. His sad isolation is transformed when he encounters a beautiful mysterious femme fatale whose involvement with the criminal underworld proves troublesome for both. The second story explores the odd relationship between a female restaurant worker and another recently jilted police officer. The strange woman decides to regularly clean and redecorate the man's apartment in his absence allowing the two to form a close intimacy without meeting face to face. Both stories present a beautifully atmospheric look at modern urban life and romance with its combination of isolation and casual unexpected meetings. Chungking Express came to the attention of American audiences thanks to the efforts of director Quentin Tarantino whose own brand of fractured storytelling and urban cool owes a debt to Wong Kar-Wai.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿Chungking Express</DIV></DIV>

It turns out that this is only a daydream but her subsequent visits to a neighboring brothel where she offers her services certainly seem to be real. This illusion/reality dichotomy extends to the final scenes in which we are offered two possible endings.

Ann feels secure and well provided-for in their relationship but she has almost no interest in sex; she tells her therapist that she's more concerned about waste disposal. John however is still quite interested in sex and is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) whose personality is fire to Ann's ice; sex is the one area in which she's been able to best her more successful sister and she relishes her ability to seduce Ann's husband. Into this dysfunctional picture comes Graham (James Spader) a college friend of John's whom he hasn't seen in nine years. Graham has decided that talking about sex is more interesting than actually having sex so he meets women and asks them discuss their desires and fantasies as he tapes them with a camcorder. A sensation at the Sundance Film Festival the film made that festival a synonym for a new brand of low-budget indie dramas about contemporary life and relationships.

Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti a mother of three whose husband Nick (Peter Falk) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous extroverted and fragile while he's controlling distant and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence. Like its title heroine the film threatens to veer out of control at any time its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship from seismic bursts of high drama to small even trivial moments of domestic tedium its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly illuminating and frustrating and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.</DIV><DIV class="tc">﻿A Woman Under the Influence</DIV></DIV>

Chronically alone Travis cannot connect with anyone not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard (Peter Boyle). He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese) the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate Charles Palatine (Leonard Harris) to violently "saving" teen hooker Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel).

In 1951 high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football go to the movies at the Royal Theater hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas Sonny is left behind in Anarene wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white with a restrained style devoid of the kind of "new wave" techniques (jump cuts zooms and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn Robert Altman Mike Nichols and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940) Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941) The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters was not as successful.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Last Picture Show</DIV></DIV>

Marcello agrees to kill a political refugee on orders from the Fascist government even though the victim-to-be is his college mentor. The film is a character study of the kind of person who willingly "conforms" to the ideological fashions of his day. In this case director Bernardo Bertolucci suggests that Marcello's desire to conform is rooted in his latent homosexuality. In addition to its strong storyline the film is critically revered for the astonishing production design by Nedo Azzini which together with Vittorio Storaro's camerawork recreates the atmosphere of Fascist Italy with some of the most complex visual compositions ever seen on film filled with highly stylized uses of angles shapes and shadows.

These lines and others became cultural touchstones as 1960s youth rebellion seeped into the California upper middle-class in Mike Nichols' landmark hit. Mentally adrift the summer after graduating from college suburbanite Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) would rather float in his parents' pool than follow adult advice about his future. But the exhortation of family friend Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) to seize every possible opportunity inspires Ben to accept an offer of sex from icily feline Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). The affair and the pool are all well and good until Ben is pushed to go out with the Robinsons' daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) and he falls in love with her. Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and an understandably disgusted Elaine runs back to college. Determined not to let Elaine get away Ben follows her to school and then disrupts her family-sanctioned wedding. None too happy about her pre-determined destiny Elaine flees with Ben -- but to what? Directing his second feature film after Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Nichols matched the story's satire of suffocating middle-class shallowness with an anti-Hollywood style influenced by the then-voguish French New Wave. Using odd angles jittery editing and evocative widescreen photography Nichols welded a hip New Wave style and a generation-gap theme to a fairly traditional screwball comedy script by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham from Charles Webb's novel. Adding to the European art film sensibility the movie offers an unsettling and ambiguous ending with no firm closure. And rather than Robert Redford Nichols opted for a less glamorous unknown for the pivotal role of Ben turning Hoffman into a star and opening the door for unconventional leading men throughout the 1970s. With a pop-song score written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon &amp; Garfunkel bolstering its contemporary appeal The Graduate opened to rave reviews in December 1967 and surpassed all commercial expectations. It became the top-grossing film of 1968 and was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture Actor and Actress with Nichols winning Best Director. Together with Bonnie and Clyde it stands as one of the most influential films of the late '60s as its mordant dissection of the generation gap helped lead the way to the youth-oriented Hollywood artistic "renaissance" of the early '70s.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Graduate</DIV></DIV>

The scene is a small town in the mid-1930s. Trapped in a dead-end job and an abusive marriage Cecelia (Mia Farrow) regularly seeks refuge in the local movie house. She becomes so enraptured by the latest attraction an RKO screwball comedy called The Purple Rose of Cairo that she returns to the theatre day after day. During one of these visits the film's main character Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) pauses in his dialogue turns towards the audience and says to Cecelia "My God how you must love this picture." Then he climbs out of the movie much to the consternation of the rest of the audience and the other characters on screen. Liberated from his customary black-and-white environs he accompanies Cecelia on a tour of the town eventually falling in love with her. Meanwhile the other Purple Rose characters unable to proceed with the film carry on a discussion with themselves. Desperately the RKO executives seek out Gil Shepherd the actor who played the hero of Purple Rose. Shepherd (also played by Daniels) is sent to Cecelia's hometown to see if he can repair the damage.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Purple Rose of Cairo</DIV></DIV>

(Tolkin also wrote the screenplay.) The film concerns a sleek and smooth Hollywood studio executive who starts receiving death threats from a disgruntled writer because he has committed the ultimate Hollywood sin -- he promised the writer he would call him back and he never did. This is particularly ironic because the studio executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is considered "writer-friendly" spending his days listening to pitches from such noted screenwriters as Buck Henry who is pushing "The Graduate Part II" and Alan Rudolph who is hawking a Bruce Willis action film described as "Ghost meets The Manchurian Candidate." But The Player finds Griffin's comfortable life style in danger of collapse. He is trying to find a way to unload his girlfriend (Cynthia Stevenson) whose independence and intelligence make her a poor candidate for a trophy wife. More importantly it seems that Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) a slippery executive from Twentieth Century Fox is angling for his job. And then there are those nasty postcards and faxes from a screenwriter threatening to kill him. Altman cast over 65 stars in cameo roles as texture for his scabrous tale.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Player</DIV></DIV>

Julie Andrews stars as Maria a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). Arriving at the Trapp home Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof and his seven children virtual automatons-at least whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise the kids are holy terrors as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children especially oldest daughter Liesl (Charmian Carr) who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness (Eleanor Parker). But the children insist that Maria return the Baroness steps out of the picture and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song "Something Good." Unhappily they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the "glories" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Sound of Music</DIV></DIV>

It was praised for its stunning originality and for the excellence of its execution. In addition it was praised for being a completely absorbing fable that both grownups and children can enjoy so long as the children are able to its handle scary bits (beginning perhaps at age seven or eight). In the story Jack Skellington (voice of Chris Sarandon) is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown a realm of reality where the inhabitants make it their life's work to scare humans on Halloween. He's good at his work and is very popular around town but it all bores him. In a funk one day he wanders into a wood where every tree is the doorway to realms serving one or another human holiday and falls through the doorway into Christmas. There he sees scenes of such glee and good will that he is overwhelmed. He returns to Halloweentown with the inspiration to persuade his fellow citizens to kidnap Santa and do Christmas in their own Halloweentown way -- complete with snakes and shrunken heads. Despite strong arguments against this project by Jack's otherwise loyal girlfriend Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara) Santa (voice of Edward Ivory) is duly captured and the townspeople prepare a very special Christmas for everyone. Jack is excited about the new plan and at first doesn't notice that Sally isn't around much anymore. Meanwhile Oogie Boogie (voice of Ken Page) a sinister opponent of Jack's has re-kidnapped Santa and has captured Sally as well. Since Sally is the true love of Jack's life and (he eventually realizes) the only one who can be relied upon to tell him the truth in every circumstance a confrontation with Oogie Boogie becomes inevitable. In addition to being a monumental work of animation (it took over 120 animators and many more technicians more than two years to film it) this show features ten very appropriate musical numbers by composer Danny Elfman who also supplies Jack's singing voice. In October 2006 fans of the innovative animated classic got to experience The Nightmare Before Christmas in a whole new dimension when the film was re-released into theaters in Disney Digital 3-D -- a process developed to add remarkable new depth to films that were originally released in standard 2-D.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Nightmare Before Christmas</DIV></DIV>
<DIV title="Fri Apr 23 11:00:36 CEST 2021" class="tr"><DIV class="tc">0094</DIV><DIV class="tc">This beautifully mounted adaptation of Walter Farley's story for children tells the tale of Alec (Kelly Reno) a young boy touring the world with his adventurous salesman father (Hoyt Axton). While travelling back to the United States by ship Alec discovers a wild beautiful Arabian stallion being brought along in the cargo hold. When disaster strikes at sea the ship sinks and Alec and the stallion are the only survivors. Alone together on a nearby island the boy and the horse develop a relationship; wary of each other at first they learn to trust each other and they become close friends. When a rescue party finally finds Alec he refuses to leave the island without the stallion and the horse goes with Alec to the small town that is his home. Alec's mother (Teri Garr) is at a loss about what to do with this remarkable but difficult animal. Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) an elderly horse trainer who lives in the neighborhood senses a special connection between the boy and his horse; he's soon convinced that with the right training and the boy as his jockey the horse could be a champion on the race course. First-time director Carroll Ballard captures the mysterious relationship between humans and animals treating the stallion with the same intelligence and respect as the rest of his cast; he also draws fine understated performances from Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney and Caleb Deschanel's photography makes this a feast for the eyes. The Black Stallion is that rare contemporary family film that will fascinate adults as much as their kids if not more so.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Black Stallion</DIV></DIV>
