The AMPAA took the highly unusual step of rejecting the movie because although the film had a British-born director (of Indian ancestry) and was co-produced by three British companies the film did not qualify as British since "Hindi was not a language indigenous to the U.K." The British Academy was forced to submit its second choice the Welsh-language "Eldra". In an ironic twist "The Warrior" went on to win "Best British Film" at the British Academy Awards the following year although it lost "Best Non-English Film" to a film from Spain.</DIV><DIV class="tc">Warrior</DIV></DIV>

Its trailer was in theaters in Summer 1999. However due to a flood of "End of the World" movies coming out at the exact same time ( End of Days Stigmata etc...) the decision was made to delay the film. Its new date was 4 February 2000. However that date was canceled after the very popular "Scream" franchise staked out that date for its final installment Scream 3. The final release date of 13 October 2000 was finally decided upon which also happened to be the same exact day as the re-release of The Exorcist.</DIV><DIV class="tc">13 October 2000</DIV></DIV>

Its trailer was in theaters in Summer 1999.

In their creation myth we live in the fourth "attempt" at creating the world while the third attempt was dismissed as a failure after its own 13th b'ak'tun. Though Mayan documents contain no such information popular culture and certain religions predict an apocalyptic event at this date. It is popularly misunderstood that the calendar "ends" on this date however the Long Count calendar can express dates from approximately 3000BC (their date for the creation of the current world) to approximately 40 octillion years in the future.

The item is a Holmes Stereoscope a device designed in 1861 by the American physician and writer Oliver Wendell Holmes for the viewing of so-called "stereocards". A stereocard is like a postcard which has a Left-view and Right-view photograph mounted alongside one another. When viewed through this stereoscope the photographs are merged into one 3-D image (which was later adopted for the ViewMaster viewers and cards). The Holmes Stereoscope was a great source of entertainment in the Victorian era. It was in a sense the Home Entertainment Centre of its day as it transported its users to exotic places all over the world. People bought packs of stereocards for their entertainment - in much the same way as we buy DVDs today! (Thus a character in a 3-D movie having no idea what a stereoscope is makes for a cute little 3-D in-joke...)</DIV><DIV class="tc">View</DIV></DIV>

The item is a Holmes Stereoscope a device designed in 1861 by the American physician and writer Oliver Wendell Holmes for the viewing of so-called "stereocards". A stereocard is like a postcard which has a Left-view and Right-view photograph mounted alongside one another. When viewed through this stereoscope the photographs are merged into one 3-D image (which was later adopted for the ViewMaster viewers and cards). The Holmes Stereoscope was a great source of entertainment in the Victorian era. It was in a sense the Home Entertainment Centre of its day as it transported its users to exotic places all over the world. People bought packs of stereocards for their entertainment - in much the same way as we buy DVDs today! (Thus a character in a 3-D movie having no idea what a stereoscope is makes for a cute little 3-D in-joke...)</DIV><DIV class="tc">1</DIV></DIV>
