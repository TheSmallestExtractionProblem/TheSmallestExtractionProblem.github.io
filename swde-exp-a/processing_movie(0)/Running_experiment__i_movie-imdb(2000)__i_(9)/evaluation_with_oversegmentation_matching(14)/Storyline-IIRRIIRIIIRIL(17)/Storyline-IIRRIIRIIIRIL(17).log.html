Cadi is torn by guilt over the death of her little sister Elen and wants the sin eater to redeem her. With the help of Fagen , son of the ruthless village leader Brogen , and the imaginary Lilybet , she starts a search to find him , but by doing so Cadi slowly , but surely unravels dark and terrible secrets.</DIV></DIV>

One of the surprises was an all-woman cast novel in the 1930's. And although there were no men in the cast most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce in the 1930's was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks and reluctantly divorces him abetted by her friends all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy. The 1939 film starring Norma Shearer Paulette Goddard Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford was a hit. This one with an even better looking cast is definitely not largely because someone tried to move a 1930's situation comedy into the present.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Based on a very clever comedy by Claire Booth , wife of Time Publisher Henry Luce and later Ambassador to Italy.
