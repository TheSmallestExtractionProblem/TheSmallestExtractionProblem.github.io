You may remember me from the end credits of Tromeo &amp; Juliet. Since that film I have been working on my craft honing my skills perfecting the fine art that is "credit-creating". To many of you insensitive cretins the changes will be imperceptible. These little things will be evident to those few who truly appreciate the credit craft. By the way I am naked right now.

A long list like that takes stamina intelligence and a winner's drive for anal minutia. If you are a large breasted (hopefully hardbodied) female who appreciates these qualities in an eggheaded spindly limbed prematurely balding man please call me -- 1(800) 83 TROMA.

Hell half these names I made up myself. I mean come on -- Antonio Canobbio? You think that's a real name. You're so stupid. I hate you. But I still want to love you. Call me at 1(800) 83-TROMA. TROMOVIE FUN FACT: Some of the production team of TERROR FIRMER was so fucked up that they were unable to find their own asses in a darkened room. They had significant trouble when the lights were on as well. Kiss and Makeup: Juan A. Gedlaid KISS makeup: kicks ass! Fart Cutters: Crew after lunch Negative Attitude: Gets You Nowhere Graphic Sex: Clinton WHite House Phlegm: More Fun Than Silly Putty PUBLIC NOTICE: THE CREDIT GUY has been fired for disclosing trade secrets and proprietary information. Disregard his previous message as the lunatic rantings of an undersexed megalomaniac. I have taken his position as Credit Guy but I am gay. While I have not yet achieved the Flaubertian or Balzac-inspired heights that Credit Guy #1 regularly achieved I need a little lovin' too.

Still Angry: Lloyd Kaufman High: Crew after hours Hi: Translation of "Yo! Yo! Yo!" TROMOVIE FUN FACT: The most dangerous stunt in TERROR FIRMER was trying to get away with using footage of the same car flip for the third time in a movie without our fans dismembering us. It's THE NEW CREDIT GUY again. Why haven't you called? I want you to be my "best boy". I've got a "key grip" I think you'll enjoy. I'm gonna "touch your ass". Call me. Extramarital Affairs: Bill Clinton Beverages: Mad Dog Beer This is THE NEW CREDIT GUY again. No one's called -- I'm sure you've all left the theater. I hope you're all happy -- I'm lonely dejected considering sleeping with a woman. Call me and cheer me up 1(800) 83 TROMA.

This refers to a short scene where the two detectives go out to a fancy-looking research lab (really a water treatment plant; also used as the set for Starfleet Academy on the TV series "Star Trek - The Next Generation). In the background of some of the shots there are two legged robots: one hopping in a circle in a tea-house; the other bouncing up a garden path. These robots are actually academic research projects from the MIT AI Lab's Legged Locomotion Lab. They really do hop about and maintain their balance. Power comes from off-board hydraulic pumps (hence the guy in the background (me!) pulling hoses for the robot) and body attitude is sensed with gyroscopes. A human with a joystick tells the robot what direction to go and the control algorithms (which are the real subject of Leg Lab research) maintain speed direction and balance. However the robots aren't designed for special effects. They're always being modified and they tend to break down frequently. This made shooting in the hot july sun of the San Fernando Valley a real nightmare with transputers crashing in the heat stuck gyros and hydraulic leaks. Three grad students and a professor worked steadily for about a month before Hollywood and then five days on the set and on location to get the robots in about 15 seconds of film. The credits are: Marc Raibert (our prof) and Charles Francois Rob Playter and Lee Campbell (me) who are students. We three students appear in the film in white lab coats acting like Robot Scientists!!</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Web Smith : Where are you from , "sempai"?
