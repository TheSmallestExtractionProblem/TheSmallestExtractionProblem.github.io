The camera is excellent one with in the budget. Also its very compact to carry outside. I bought this camera for Rs.6540 from other online store. Package includes : 4GB DS Card , USB Cablle , Power Cord & Adapter , HDMI cable , Wrist Strap , Instruction Manual , Camera Case ( outside the box ) and 2Years Warranty card. So no need to buy SD Card... The quality of image is superb. So if you are looking for a compact camera in 20MP , go for it !!

GOOD CAMERA I recently purchased this camera from Flipkart , Quite Good camera with 20 megapixel with superb quality , It is just little bit compact from outside , features of this camera is good and while taking pics in night is Awesome . If you will compare the price with other online store , you will get it in a lesser price but getting it through Flipkart by paying 100 or 200 would be better option and to will increase the confidence.

First of all , excellent delivery and service by Flipkart. Second of all thank you Flipkart for having great brands like Lowepro listed. Thirdly , the Pro Runner series by Lowepro is an excellent series of bags with many of my friends photographers using this series of bags since many years , excellent quality and usability , thus i went for this , affordable , life time warranty and a trusted brand. Nothing more we could ask for at this price tag. Once while carrying the equipment my bag by mistake fell down , but all the equipment was safe and undamaged.

A good bag for protecting your DSLR The padding in the bag is very good , and feels nice and solid. It will protect your valuable camera and lenses from accidental drops or during travel. The small divider pads that divide the inside of the bag into compartments can be actually moved because they attach to the sides of the pad with a velcro. This allows you to create compartments of different sizes to suit your lenses. I've the following items in the bag right now : 1. 3x filters with case 2. 18 - 55 mm lens 3. 50mm lens 4.

Canon EOS 550D DSLR camera 5. Canon battery charger 6. Lens hoods for two lenses 7. PC connectivity cable for the camera I'll easily have space for another 3 or 4 lenses ( assuming they're reasonably sized ) . If I have a large lens ( like a 300mm prime ), that can be attached to the camera while keeping in. This is possible because , again , the pads can be adjusted. There are a two small velcro secured pouches inside the bag for storing extra memory cards. There's also a zipper into which you can put some papers or whatever. The outside of the bag has zipper too , and has provision to carry a tripod of reasonable size and weight. There's also a all weather cover that can be pulled from under the back side of the bag , which is otherwise folded and secured into its compartment , locked by a velcro. Couple of things that I felt could be improved : 1. I wish that the zippers were a little more smooth 2. The shoulder straps could have been well padded Overall , it's a very good bag for Rs. 3650 that I paid. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

I also get the same All - Weather cover that i had in the old bag. Also , the waist straps can be tucked in and they don't dangle around when not needed. The only slight disadvantage I think is getting the gear out and change lenses. Earlier with the side bag it was very convenient to change lenses , now its a little difficult. So , all in all a good bag with lots of features and I got it at a very good discount. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful.

Captures very neat images , especially the macro shots. Very impressed with the picture quality. I would say it is perfect for its price tag. The only thing that you may want to complain about is the zoom ring being a little tight. Hence , one would need to put in some effort to rotate it. May get smoother in the long run. Please read through the manual properly before use , as there are a couple of per - requisites that you need to meet when you switch to Macro Mode. In short , I am very happy with my buy! If you are on a tight budget. am sure you would wanna go for it than spend on expensive Canon lens. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

Not necessarily a good lens I picked up this lens from flipkart recently. In terms of the order processing , payment and delivery , it has been excellent from flipkart side. However , the quality of the lens itself leaves a lot to be desired. At extreme end - 300 mm - there is a visible chromatic aberration on all photos. The images at the tele end of the lens are quite soft. Also , if you want to shoot flying birds - where fast AF is required - this is not a choice. That said , the performance at wide and ( 70mm to 200 mm generally ) is good. The macro functionality is impressive at 180mm to 200 mm range.… I picked up this lens from flipkart recently.

I was using normal pencil batteries and while flash is on within three clicks battery is down.Without flash battery exhausted in 15 clicks. Hope there will be some solution to it.

This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer , Blink Proof alerting and Red - Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p. It takes very sharp images in daylight and indoors. One of the cons of this camera is that low light photography is a bit blurry but still decent. A 4GB SDHC card is provided along with the camera.

No in between pausing of video recording possible. So each time you have to stop and so new file will get created. 12. Has a wifi kind of icon displayed on screen. But has no wifi connectivity.

Believe me there is really very little difference between shots taken by Canon D700 when compared with Nikon 5200. Under Lowlight condition , Nikon has slight advantage over Canon. However , till ISO of 6400 both the camera performs similarly. The Nikon D5200 has 39 focus point ( 9 cross focus point ) in comparison to 9 ( all cross focus points ) but in Canon all the cross focus points are well spread out in comparison to Nikon which has all cross focus point at the center. Taking a shot of moving object is slightly better in Canon 700 in comparison to Nikon D5200. Both Canon D700 and Nikon D5200 is great camera and each has their own merits and demerits and for sure you would repent whether you go with Canon or Nikon.

Even my local vendor asked for 02 days to make this lens available. Kudos to flipkart. Talking about the lens , all I can say is that it delivers more then what you are paying. In some terms it is much better then Nikkor's version. Pro's : 1. The optics of this lens are better then Nikkor. Images even at the 300mm are clear and sharp. No visible softness observed. 2.

In some terms it is much better then Nikkor's version. Pro's : 1. The optics of this lens are better then Nikkor. Images even at the 300mm are clear and sharp. No visible softness observed. 2. The Auto focus is pretty fast and noise free. Not as fast as the pro level lenses but fast enough that you will not feel the difference so much if you are not deeply into pro lenses. 3. Marginal better low light performance then Nikkor version because of aperture 4.0 - 5.6 vs 4.5 - 5.6. 4. Nicely built. Firm and gives good feel while holding. Plastic and the rubber rings give good finish. 5. VC ( Vibration Compensation ) is far better then the competitors. Con's : 1. VC ( Vibration Compensation ) makes more noise then the AF. Not that it will annoy you but makes noise. 2. Rear lens element is deep inside the body and it's open. Which makes it almost impossible to change lens in tougher weather conditions. I'll rate this lens 5 / 5 as it serves the purpose and that too without hitting at your pocket. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 5 of 5 users found this review helpful.

After a lot of confusion and reading a lot of reviews , I decided to buy this lens , because its performance at 300mm is better than Nikon and I am very happy with my decision. The only problem with Tamron is , they have only 3 service centers in India. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

Tamron 70 - 300 Zoom Lens Review I have recently bought this lens through flipcart. I made this decision after reading many reviews comparing Nikon and Tamron 70 - 300 lens. Flipcart service was good , I got this lens in time in excellent condition. After trying this lens with my Nikon D5100 I found its color saturation and detail to be very good. Even at 300mm the image looks crystal clear and its focusing and VR works very smooth. I think I made a right decision buying this lens for my DSLR.

I read a lot of reviews before purchasing the Tam 70 - 300 and m pretty impressed with its offering. One of my friend also own this lens fr 1 yr now and he is all praised about it. The only con which I have noted so far : - The focal length is not that smooth to roll. May be it will become smoother later!

VC is just as good as advertised , for still subject you can shoot even at 1 / 80sec handheld at 300mm. You will be amazed the quality of portraits you will get from this lens . beautiful bokeh starting from 70mm. For review watch YouTube Tamron 70 - 200 f2.8 VS Tamron 70 - 300 F / 4 - 5.6 VC.

Only difference I found so far is Mega - Pixel , which i don't value at all , anything above 8MP is ok , if you don't print very large hard copies of your photo. Many features like spot metering , tilt - LCD ( though not all weather friendly ), wifi / bluetooth / infrared should have been there. It feels like these features are deliberately dropped to keep it an entry level model. Giving only 2 star , as i found it highly overpriced. The current price should have included 55 - 250mm lens.

Following is a short review : First of all , who is this bag for? If you plan on carrying multiple lenses , if you have a large DSLR body with attched zoom lens like 55 - 200 or 70 - 300 , if you plan to carry too many accessories like flash , battery charger etc. then this BAG IS NOT FOR YOU. If you already have a dedicated DSLR carry solution which can accommodate your extra lens , your flash , tripod , filters etc. BUT need a small carry solution for just your DSLR body with attached kit lens ( 18 - 55 ) or 50mm prime lens for those events which dont require you to haul all your paraphernalia then THIS BAG IS TOTALLY FOR YOU. Personally I use it to carry my Nikon D3300 with kit lens. PROS : 1 ) Extremely well constructed DSLR bag : Like all lowepro products the construction of this bag is superb , this bag has been built to last the test of time and to go the complete distance. 2 ) Superb padding : To protect the DSLR the padding provided inside of the bag is excellent and will do the job. 3 ) Antislip strap : The anti slip add on stitched into the strap works fantastic , there is no way that strap is slipping from your shoulder. 4 ) Extreme convenience for carrying and using the bag. 5 ) Tips and Hacks : I use a carbiner or hook on the D - ring and attach it to my belt loop on the jeans to prevent the bag moving about. You can also loop your belt through the bag. 6 ) Attached rain cover is pretty cool. Have not tested it in rains though. 7 ) The bag is insanely light!!! CONS : 1 ) With the rain cover ON you cannot take the DSLR out of the bag!!! 2 ) Putting the rain cover ON is pretty cumbersome. Overall I am super happy with the purchase , I picked up this bag on a sale ( Rs.945 /-) which ended up being a total steal. Ordered at night 1130 and the product was delivered next day at 11.

Its better to buy from authorized nikon outlets than from online so that our penny spent seems to have some safety in respect to after sales and service. Currently nikkon provides some offer for new purchase of camera go through nikon site. I recommend this product to others. My Suggestion wait till WSRetail makes this product available or buy in you local authorized shop. Happy Nikkoooorrrrring !

Awesome camera & Absolute Steal at Price Rs. 29999 /- I bought this camera on April 4th 2014. • I recommend the Nikon D3300 to everyone who asks what camera to buy for great photos of family , friends , sports , concerts , theater and action. • Got kids and want great action , low - light and long - distance photos?

The D3300 is the camera to get. Paying more won't get you much more other than a lot more weight to have to carry around. • The built - in flash is excellent. You probably don't need a separate flash unless you're trying to shoot action or kids which demand a fast recycle time. • The included 18 - 55mm VR II is probably all you need for everything. If you're new to photography , the strongest advice I can give you from 45 years of experience is that it's far more important to learn how to use what you've got , instead of confusing the issue by buying more lenses , as you're starting out. • Personally , I usually use the 35mm f / 1.8 DX for everything and leave the 18 - 55mm VR at home. • The D3300's LCD is big , bright , sharp and color - accurate. You couldn't really put a bigger or better screen on a camera this small. • Like most DSLRs , the battery lasts forever. The biggest worry you should have is being lulled into forgetting to bring your charger on a long trip. • New in the D3300 , a swept panorama mode lets us hand - hold and swipe the D3300 in any of four directions to make a 180º panorama. • Color rendition is superb ; the D3300 uses all the same picture controls , with matching results , to all the other current Nikon cameras. PROS : Small for a DSLR ; Retracting lens makes camera compact ; Sharp , clear images with accurate color ; Video has smooth movement ; Great price CONS : No tilting LCD screen ; Limited shooting controls. VERDICT : The Nikon D3300 is an excellent entry - level camera for aspiring photographers , delivering a good feature set and high - quality images.

Canon is more famous because of it is easy to use as well as good marketing programs such as Loyalty Programs which makes you buy Canon again and suggest your friends to buy canon , more like Network Marketing but Nikons are more sharp especially when cropped at 100% Nikon are more sharp and have Less noise. Other reason why Canon is more famous because the people who buy a DSLR Camera are 80% enthusiasts and 20% or less professionals. A non proffestional want an easy to use Camera while Proffessionals are more concerned about picture quality. These 80% can become proffessional at some point they may choose their previous brand . so there are more Canons than Nikon. Comparing D3300 and 600d , D3300 is a new camera , Faster autofocus with Expeed 4 , more megapixels 24MPX vs 18MPX , 5fps vs 3.7fps , good performance in low light - Low noise at 1385 ISO vs 793 ISO and 60fps vs 30fps D3300 is a clear winner. If you still have doubts , goto Dxomark.com and get the scientific test results and Search in google that "Nikon d3300 flickr" goto group pool open the images at 6000x4000 resolution and compare them with 600d by doing the same.

Apart from the Vari - Angled - LCD which can be found in Nikon D5000 series , which is a bit fascinating and helpful in clicking vari - angled shots , this DSLR is firstly LIGHT WEIGHTED and COMPACT. The retractable AF - S 18 - 55 mm VR II Kit Lens is a bonus point added to this beauty. Though I'd suggest to go for a Nikon prime lens or a wide angle telephoto zoom lens if you are fantasizing about crisp sharp portrait images with blurry backgrounds or landscape photography. As a beginner , there's lot to learn , for which there's a special Shooting Mode called GUIDE mode which will help you additionally while taking shots of your choice. However , since it is a DSLR , the other shooting modes like Portrait , Landscape , Sports , Child , Night Portrait and other modes will help you accordingly. Another beauty added is the EFFECTS mode which can help you click images in Super Vivid mode , Silhouette mode , Pop mode , High - Key and Low - Key modes , etc. I have personally found Super Vivid mode to be very much promising if you want to play with colors. Over all , for beginners in Digital Photography , go for this one at a very reasonable price. Initially you'll get a AF - S 18 - 55 mm VR II Kit Lens along with the camera body but going forward , choose your lens according to your photography skill enhancement. A value for money buy for a value for money experience. :) \ m / Cheers... :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

Does it mean D5100 is inferior - the answer is "NO" but just that it has a more experienced and better equipped elder brother who has joined the family. Both the cameras have common strengths and weaknesses. To mention a few - STRENGTHS - Low noise ( grain ) at high ISO's / good image quality and colour depth / flip out screens / focus continuously while recording movies / in - camera HDR ( high dynamic range ) WEAKNESSES - No focus motor / slow max shutter speed ( 1 / 4000 of a second ) / no image stabilization / no panorama mode / slow continuous shooting ( 5fps on D5200 vs 4fps on D5100 ) DIFFERENCES - D5100 is a good 10k less than D5200 with the 18 - 55mm kit lens / longer battery life in D5100 So why should one buy a D5200??? 1. Many more focus points - 39 vs 11 2. Much higher resolution - 24MP vs 16.1MP 3. More cross - type focus points - 9 vs 1 4. Shoots faster - 5fps vs 4fps 5. In - built audio - Stereo vs Mono D5100 was launched in April 2011 I have not had a proper opportunity to put my camera through the grid but the few shots taken are simply amazing. I will probably write another review later. I am a complete amateur so far as photography goes but learning everyday. Hope the above helps...

New feature of using it with WR - R10 will be a plus point to those who want wireless. Megapixel has been upgraded from 16mp to 24mp though I am not a pixel peeper.. In nut and shell I can say that it has stolen most of the qualities of D7000 that includes 39 autofocus. Ofcource at this price no company would give you a metal body with prosumer grade dslr qualities . One good thing is that it has a fantastic metering and has no over exposure and back focus problem like D7000. Nikon has worked nicely on it. So that is why I would recommend this product to you....

Marvelous job FlipKart. I have a passion for photography. Having said that , I am no expert on DSLR's. To satiate my passion , I first bought myself Cannon EOS 1000D and used it extensively for shooting portraits , wildlife , nature , buildings etcetra over a 3 year period. I was impressed with the pictures until i came across a friend who showed the images he had shot using Nikon D5100. Despite lacking in professional knowledge on photography , i could easily see the difference in sharpness and quality of images. Nikon was definitely in a different league. I decided to progress to the next level and buy a Nikon. Before purchase , i did my research by comparing Nikon with Cannon. I was glad that Nikon camera's scored higher on various parameters when compared with a relative product manufactured by Cannon. I brought down my search to two products of Nikon , D90 and D5200. I spent sometime studying both. And finally decided to go in for D5200 buoyed by the various modes of photography offered on this camera. Despite my research i was tentative since i was not paying peanuts for this camera. When i finally got the camera , I started exploring it. I was fascinated with the choice of modes , the menu options , the image quality , size , flash effect to mention a few. The camera also enables you to shoot using various effects instead of editing using applications. The camera came with an 18 - 55 mm VR kit lens. I have shot portraits , buildings and nature using this product. And boy have i been impressed with the images. My journey with this fascinating product has just begun. So far so good!

Click on "Register Your Product" button. Follow the instructions displayed. During this registration process , keep a soft - copy of the Invoice , and your camera / lens' serial numbers ( these numbers are printed on the outer - right side panel of sealed box along with bar codes ) . The Camera body , 18 - 55 lens , 55 - 250 lens have unique serial numbers for each of them. All these three are to be registered one after the other. Typically the camera body serial number will have more digits than the lens. Let's use a hypothetical example , say these are the numbers found on the box : ( 11 ) 123456789012 , ( 22 ) 1234567890 , ( 33 ) 0987654321. The first one should be of the Camera body and the other two are of the Lenses. When registering , omit the content within parantheses and use the remaining part. Going by the same example considered above , you should use 123456789012 to register the camera body , and so on. If the above still fails : There is an option to raise an "Escalation" from Canon Edge India product registration web page itself. Basically , it's our opportunity to tell Canon India that a camera with the Serial Number is bought in India , on a specific date. Canon India immediately issues an Escalation Tracking ID on our e - mail. Internally , Canon India validates how the camera with the specific serial number came into India , whether it was a legal import by Canon India Pvt Ltd. , or not , whether it's a brand new camera / used one elsewhere , etc. , and they will inform the final status back to us on our e - mail ID. Assuming it is all genuine and Canon processed the escalation in our favor , product in our hand can be registered to avail warranty and other benefits. In case there is no response within , say , 5 to 10 working days : Carry the camera along with lenses , the box and the Invoice to your nearest Canon Service Center. They will be able to do a manual inspection & advise your options. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 60 of 61 users found this review helpful.

Check with Flipkart customer care before you buy - potentially no Warranty I have just bought the EOS1200D with the Zoom lens additionally.While specs mention 2 year warranty , when i went ahead to register my Warranty on the Canon India website - it said it'll only take up warranties of products made in India or Singapore.Now the camera is made in Taiwan - essentialy meaning the camera will carry no warranty.It is a trade malpractice that needs to be escalated - Flipkart is responsible since it mentions the 2 year Warranty.

Good camera but poor policy The camera and Flipkart delivery service is good. But I am expressing one serious concern.When I tried to register for Canon complimentary photography workshop its serial number failed to register. The product is from Taiwan but registration is only valid for Indian and Singapore marketing zone. So I am even seriously anxious about its warranty issues. Flipkart should be more aware of these after sell issues related to validity of warranty according to manufacturing countries.

Only minor improvement possible on the deal is the bag and memory card. Bag is a bit small and memory card could have more storage ; but both of these can be easily fixed by buying new bag and memory card ; the bag however does fit my camera body , both lenses , data cable , and charger. Long story short , if you love great cameras and have a desire to capture life like moments , EOS 1200D is the machine you need. Buy it now.

Nevertheless , all these products have warranty , even though these products are made in Taiwan.

But before getting a DSLR , be know about its Service Charges.I request you to visit an authorized Service Center and look into their Service Charge Rates - I have a Canon 550D and recently I gave its lens for cleaning the dust / moisture - in warranty period - you know they have charged me Rs , 2248 /- for cleaning the lens , and it took 15days to return.

Ok , my first DSLR , this camera is excellent , lightweight enough and powerful. Has an APS - C sensor which is closely packed with 18 million light sensor pixels , more than excellent for an Entry Level , this enables the shots being rendered low in noise and grains under low light conditions or while using higher ISO. The 18 - 55mm IS II lens is though very slow ( or maybe stupid ) while in AF mode , so I almost always tend to use MF , this is not seen in the 55 - 250mm IS II , in fact the later is quite fast in AF registration , and equally smart in MF mode. The camera body has a good grip and feel unlike its predecessor , EOS 1100D which is kept by a friend of mine , which has more plastic feel. The EOS 1200D feels rubberized at the grips which is fantastic , it also has better control and switch placements than the previous. Still , no in - body image stabilization is a considerable drawback , Sony , Pentax are miles ahead than Canon and Nikon in this context. One point , I'm using this for almost a week , but still could not found where are the RAW and / or RAW+JPEG shooting modes hidden , well , I can refer to the manual , but , I think I should find it by myself , isn't it funny? If you plan to use old lenses using lens mount to EF - S adapters , this camera is a good choice as different modes , like Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority mode are quite easy to use , intelligent camera indeed for amateurs. Accessories provided are sufficient , the battery is quite capable in delivering 500+ shots in use after fully charged , USB cable , the Strap is good , free 8GB SD Card , CDs and manuals... Inference : Go ahead without hesitation , it'll amaze you , believe me. Never the less , there are other better models targeted at pro - s , still , this one is too good , maybe best and smartest as an Entry Level DSLR for amateurs and also for semi pro - s... Peace.

Features of the product remain the same wherever you buy it from , what matters is the after sales service which I am yet to test it which I feel now , will be offered by Canon now. For the canon team a simple advice / feedback....the bag offered with the DSLR looks very cheap for a product offered at Rs.34000. I am big fan of the canon products but every time Canon has offered cheap bags with the cameras. Request you to rectify it.

This lens won't auto focus with the camera mentioned before. However if you are into still and portrait , you can get good pics with it using manual focus. Having a f / 1.8 aperture , this lens work well in low light condition. If you need help with manual focus , use the range finder option in your dslr , however range finder only works in A or P mode. In M mode you have to rely on the focus light in your viewfinder which can be annoying sometimes. Beside that , this lens is actually a really good lens for it's price.

Only if the lens had a focus motor in it ( AF - S primes wont come this cheap ), it could be the only lens you will ever need. ( you can zoom with your legs ) . For all those people out there who owns an entry level Nikon DSLR , bear these points in mind. 1 ) patience is needed to get focus in low light conditions. the AF assist beam wont work. so even though the lens can take in so much light , you cant focus if you cant see a thing. ( i tried using a torch in low light to find focus and it works , if you r desperate ) 2 ) It might be a good idea to buy a tripod , unless you are shooting in very illuminated environments all the time. 3 ) DSLRS are known for the ability to take photos instantaneously ( Negligible time to power on cameras ), here you wont be able to take photos instantaneously. 4 ) when you try to shoot a group photo you will miss the 18 - 55 VR kit lens. other than this , when compared to kit lens , this nikkor is 1 ) sharper 2 ) lighter 3 ) less distorted 4 ) brighter P.S. Today i found out that the lens is kind of soft @ 1.8f and the image looks sharper @ 2.8f. So 2.8f is the largest aperture to be if you want sharp results. the sharpness progressively increases from 2.8f .So people shooting at 1.8f are prone to get soft and out of focus images. This is not a problem of the lens because depth of field and focusing greatly reduces @1.8f , a slight mistake will ruin the image.

If you are using high end camera like D7000 then turn the aperture ring to f22 and lock it there before mounting. There is no use of the movable aperture ring on your camera. You can do thatusing camera itself ( command dial ) . Shoot in A or M mode. Otherwise camera will show error and will not identify lens.

Even then you could use it well with MF and for macros ( see last paragraph ) Excellent for portraits especially on an APS - C sensor. If you are into macro photography , it is one of the best lens to reverse mount on your camera using a 200 /- reverse ring. The results are excellent. The fact that it is a D ( not G ) lens , gives you the manual aperture ring which helps with reverse mount macros. Similarly , you can use it very well with extension tubes.

It has excellent picture quality ( way better than point and shoots offering higher megapixels ) Has intuitive modes which help you whenever you dont feel like going manual. Also , the package containing the 55 - 250 mm lens is a good deal coz sooner or later one tends to buy zoom lenses. Overall i think this double kit pack is one to go far.

Great deal , especially for a beginner I'm not going to go into the tech specs and the pros and cons of the camera , a lot of other reviews on this site have done a much better than I can and the best place for a quality tech review is a tech website. This is just my experience with the camera and why I bought it. Firstly , as the title says , it's a great deal. You get the 55 - 250 mm IS lens which much cheaper with this bundle than if you bought it separately and it's a great telephoto for a beginner.

I have loved using this telephoto at a corporate football tournament my firm took part in and on safari. the IS is great. ( reaches out to 400mm when you take into account the 1.6 crop factor ) This is my first DSLR and I didn't want to make the mistake many first time DSLR buyers make which is to spend all / most of their money on the best body they can afford and then have no money for the lens / es they want. This camera has been great , takes great picture , it does everything a good DSLR should and well , and it will be a long time before your skill as a photographer exceeds the capabilities of this camera. That being said , my sister bought herself the 550D and for the price difference , if your budget permits , it really is more than worth it and I would recommend you go for the 550D. ( Especially if you want to record video ) The next lens I'm looking at buying is either the Cannon 35mm f / 2 or the Cannon 50mm f / 1.8 , but you should look at what lens will suit your style of photography. All in all , I'm very happy with my purchase and I have no regrets till date.

Now the telephoto Canon lens of 55 - 250mm would cost approx 17 , 500 /- if you want to buy it separately. But the deal gives you both lenses & the camera body at just 31 , 000 /- . That's quite a deal. Because for all digital SLRs two lenses are a must : 18 - 55mm & 55 - 250mm or 18 - 55mm & 70 - 300mm. And lastly , needless to say , The Canon brand name also matters. We all know that the worlds best two camera manufacturing brands are Canon & Nikon. Most of the professional photographers in the world use these brands. So what more can you ask for at this price !! However , Always Remember : Buying the world's most expensive camera , just because you can afford it , does not make you a great photographer. A good photographer can take breath - taking pictures with just an ordinary camera. So it is upon how well you know your job rather than how expensive your equipment is. It's just like the old saying - "A true musician can make the cheapest instrument sing" !!

I assure you that you wont be able to carry a tripod everywhere and besides 50mm beyond 250mm wont make much of a difference.

You can choose maximum 1080p w / 30 fps or 720p w / 60fps with clear audio too in both these modes. But , for these frame rates you will have to set TV system to NTSC in Camera's options. Good camera though. Very VFM. But sadly , I am not that satisfied with the Flipkart experience. The following shortcomings I noticed : 1. The delivery was promised on May 2. Didn't come. Then expected delivery date shifted to 6th May. Didn't come. It came on 7th May. 2. Instead of promised 67mm UV filter , I was given a cheaper 58mm filter which did not fit into 18 - 135 lens. I had to fit that filter into another lens. 3. Instead of Lens Cleaner , I was given a cheaper Lens pen which is hardly worth it. 4. The camera's seal was a half seal , somewhat like it was torn from both sides. And the Camera Manual's polythene was torn ( that was INSIDE THE BOX!! ) . I can't believe Canon guys did it , then maybe someone opened the camera box before I did?! I clearly told them all this ( except point no. 3 that I just noticed ) over their Customer service email 4 - 5 days ago. But not even a reply came?? Such an insult of customer. Flipkart Experience : 1 / 5 Camera Quality & Experience : 4.5 / 5 Overall : 3 / 5 Stars. Recommendation : Get this camera. Its good. Get it from your nearest retailer I would say.

Being a beginner and my budget I did research a lot on Nikon 5200 versus Canon 60D and 600D and finally deciding to live with 600D. Nikon 5200 , I guess does not have the autofocus motor , unlike Canon models in the same range. I still need to explore a lot of features on 600D. I am simply blown off on the quality of images from EOS 600D ( Rebel T3i ) .... extremely happy to have this camera on - board. Got a 4GB SD cart and camera bag ( quality seems good ) as part of the offer package. But no lens cleaning cloth :(:( ...may be trivial , but essential which I feel should have been included as part of the camera package. Coming to the customer service part......product was delivered ahead of time. Good job on that. I had asked for the product to be gift wrapped with a customized message. Well , it was an anniversary gift. The gift wrapper looked like a warped Band - Aid tied to an aging victim of misery.......sorry no pun here...but the gift wrapping was extremely lousy. I could have spent that Rs.30 by getting this package gift wrapped from a local shop. Shockingly , any gift , should have the personalized message label / sticker stuck on top of the package , which was nowhere seen!!!. Finally found it inside the shipment box , stuck underneath the carton flaps below the box , which I luckily found. Overall the shipment package was warped....luckily camera box was intact. So , my recommendation would be that if users want their items to be gift wrapped , better to get it done locally , rather than from Flipkart / seller......not sure if anyone else had the same experience. I would rate the product 5 out of 5. Customer service as 3 out of 5. Regarding ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 6 of 6 users found this review helpful.

The bad stuff - WHICH THEN BECAME AWESOME! Great / kickass buy as a camera. Great delivery as usual. Flipkart first sent me a card which was a class 4 card and not compatible with the camera. They gave me a new card ( 32 GB ) a class 10 card which works fantastically. Thanks FK , never been let down by you'll. Best company ever!!

The camera is undoubtedly SUPERB !!! For the first timers and people who are confused among this and Nikon 5100 , just do one thing. Go to a good camera store , hold both of them , click a couple of pictures , feel them and see which one suits you better. That's it. However , the 18 - 135 lens is a plus plus here. And with the pricing Flipkart offers along with the combo , it just can't get better. Had compared this with other retailers but none could come close enough.

We are living in a time where actually difference between cameras is just feel and not quality and other things. All the cameras out there can produce brilliant images , if you know how to use them. Don't believe me? Go to Flikr , open camera finder and look at the stunning pictures taken from canon / nikon / pantex / olympus and even iPhone 4s / galaxy S3s and Nokia's. Don't be fooled when someone says "this camera can take good pictures" , coz its the person behind the camera who takes the picture. Camera just prints it on the sensor or film. Now about the camera , 600D. It takes nice pictures. It has all the features a beginner should need , and then some when you grow as a photographer and add some thingamajigs it will let you. Picture quality is very good , if you have some good glasses then you can produce excellent images. Noise is there at high ISO , but which camera doesn't? Nikon is a bit better , but only when you see you images at 100% magnification , then only you can tell some difference. What to do? shoot in RAW and use software noise reduction ( In - camera noise reduction can loose some details ) I use Adobe lightroom 4.3 , which has very good noise reduction algorithms. **Always shoot in RAW**. Or you can use lower ISO with lower shutter speeds. Flipkart gives you a free tripod , right? 2nd thing about in camera focus motor. No , conon does not have it. Shocking? Actually all the EF line series of Canon cameras have internal focus motors , so why you need and in - body motor? canon dumped their entire lens lineup in 1987 , in favor of EF ( and EF - S ), where now in - body focus motor is not necessary. Nikons still have there pre - F mount..hmm.. bayonet mount ...err..whatever mount lens compatibility. Some of older lenses ( like 50mm f1.8 D ) which still require in - body focus motor , so they left it there. Now your choice...cheaper body and costly lenses , or slightly costly body and cheaper , but optically just as good , if not better ( actually some are better ), lenses. Nikon AF - S lenses are not costlier , actually many of the canon lenses are costlier. for example , canon EF 70 - 300 f4 - 5.6 USM IS lens is 46k on FK , canon is 35k something. Don't know which one is better though. I have used canon one , which is pretty good , not like L lens , but good. There are other way around examples as well. You see , you can debate your whole span of life which one is better , but people who take great pictures , go out in the field with whatever gear they have , and produce beautiful images. So choose whichever suits you , which feels good in your hand and start shooting. Make the best of the gear you have , even a Hasselblad or Leica is not perfect. Why I bought canon? 1.I had a budget , in which I felt this was the best model ( Sadly they reduces the price the 3rd day I bought it ) :(( 2. This one felt good in my hand , nikon was a little too small. 3. I have friends , who have canons , so I can borrow some lenses : D. This one can produce great images in good hands , and crap in bad. It doesn't do anything on its own. Happy snapping. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 91 of 95 users found this review helpful.

ISO 3200 and 6400 ( the highest of the native ISO range ) produce acceptable levels of noise for reduced or web resolution use. Colour noise at full magnification is quite pronounced though. Video quality Video quality , as with the 550D , is excellent. It's simply the best you can get on any SLR in this particular price bracket. Colour rendition is superb and the video image is smooth. Even the internal microphone seems to produce better audio than on the 550D. The 600D also gets manual audio levels ( though still no method to monitor the audio before recording apart from referring to the visual meter ) .

Below are the reasons for which I went for 600D - 1. Previously I used Canon SX150IS which gave me a good amount of manual control with the limited feature of a compact camera. I believe that experience also forced me to go for 600D. 2. I also went to a shop to check their physical built and to be honest with you everyone should try this before buying a DSLR. Canon 600D felt very comfortable to hold in my hands. It is slightly bigger than 5100. This was also a driving factor. 3. Last but not the least was the Auto focus feature. Canon DSLR has this feature in their body ( entry to high end model ), where as Nikon provides it in lens for entry level models. Some more points you should consider before purchase - 1. Canon and Nikon has their own ecosystem for lenses. Third party lenses are also available for both. If you are thinking to take your photography to next level then you should study your options. As the kit lens will not do 100% justice to the camera sensor in terms of quality. 2. Please do not fall for Megapixel gimmick. As a beginner you would hardly take A4 prints of your photos. For that both of the cameras has good amount of MP. Just remember on APS - C sensor higher resolution could end up with nasty image noise. Both cameras are awesome and comparing them according to technical specification would do no justice. Each having some strength or weakness compared to other. But both of them can deliver mesmerizing images. So go for the one which makes you feel like it is an extension of your creative part. I choose Canon as I felt the same. Thank you Flipkart for awesome delivery. Packaging was very good. The camera was delivered within the next day of purchase.

But if you compare this one with Nikon D5100 , Nikon may score better in terms of image quality and price. But 600D scores well in video quality. 18MP in 600D and 16.1MP in D5100 wont make a big difference. The wireless flash option which is in 600D is a handly feature , which is not there in D5100 and external wireless flash transmitter cost too much. I'm a Canon fan so i opted for Canon.

Burst speed - pretty good! I tried it with AI Servo focus mode on my 11 month old son always on the move , and the results are fantastic! 4. Image noise - yes , it's present at 1600 ISO , but why would you even shoot beyond 800 ISO in these mid - range DSLRs? 5. Build quality - Made in Taiwan , and feels pretty solid except for the SDCard and Battery doors. Would have been happier with a 'Made in Japan' , but it's ok , we're a third world country! 6. 18 - 55 kit lens - I wish Canon gave a lens as sharp as the ones that come with Sony SLTs. No comparison here , the SLTs' kit lens are way better. It might sound subjective , but you be the judge 7. Video quality and options - awesome at this price point What could have been better? ( note : these are not cons ) 1. Auto focus on live view ( contrast detect ) - pathetic , and I'm more convinced to use the optical viewfinder :) 2. Missing proximity sensor under the view - finder ( the 550D had this!! ) 3. Mode dials do not rotate 360 deg. My Canon S5IS rotates perpetually , which is good 4. Bundling an HDMI cable would have been a nice touch Note 1 : I didn't buy from Flipkart for 2 reasons. 1. Much lower price at a local store near my place. 2. Didn't want any of their freebies ( 'll buy them separately , later ) Note 2 : WARRANTY registration on Canon Edge. When I tried to register my camera , it said 'Serial number not found'. I panicked and even went to the lengths of thinking that it could be a smuggled product as I bought for cheap :( Then after digging around , wrote a mail to admin@canonedge.com with a screenshot of my invoice , and I was able to register the product after 24 hours. @Kunal Puri - this answers your question?

The 18 - 55 mm wide angle lens is a starter's lens which will help you click everything. From portraits to landscapes to even street photography. Though I do recommend getting a 50mm prime lens ( priced 7 , 000 right now ) along with this camera. Prime lenses deliver quality which can only be experienced. Anyways , the battery backup is awesome. One full day of clicking still leaves you with some battery to view the pics on your way back home. Video shooting is excellent. Auto focus is a pure charmer and with the right memory card you can shoot everything from TVCs to short films to documentaries and even feature films ( trust me , I have a Master's degree in journalism n mass communication ) . The camera comes with a BnW mode as well. The flash is more than capable of getting clear photographs in the dark. Although getting a lens hood is recommended. Now when I got this camera , I got a tripod stand which I fell in love with almost instantly. Family photographs , long exposure shots or simply standing in my room hooked to the tripod... the camera offers so much once paired with the tripod. The camera came with a bag , Canon camera strap , lens cleaner , two memory cards ( 4gb and 16gb , offers keep changing ) and a tripod stand. I have journeyed with this camera up in the hills and even in the plains. It is an awesome camera and I would more than recommend it.

Firstly I would like to state that I chose this camera after a lot of research before - hand and on use I am not disappointed even in the least! The 600D is a definite winner! PROS : 1.

Firstly I would like to state that I chose this camera after a lot of research before - hand and on use I am not disappointed even in the least! The 600D is a definite winner! PROS : 1. The scene features and shooting features are many more than the predecessors , giving a wider set of tools to the photographer. 2. The swivel LCD screen is exceptionally clear and does justice in terms of contrast of the taken picture , on transferring the pics I found that there was no or negligible difference in the contrast displayed. The fact that it can be turned in different directions enables for self portraits , event shooting over crowds etc. 3. the construction of the camera body is good , not excessively heavy and has a textured non slip kind of surface , I found that single hand shooting also felt pretty secure. 4. the in kit 18 - 55 lens is good for medium depth and macro photography though due to its minimum aperture , indoor photography and low light photography tends to look dull , daylight photography is beautiful. The ONLY concern that I have is in the joint of the swivel LCD screen , it turns a full 180 only in one direction and 90 in the opposite direction , if by chance excess force is applied twisting in the wrong direction the screen might snap , so except for a little caution when handling it there's no other issue as such. All in all its a worthy buy , definitely recommend it for beginners , amateurs and semi - professional photographers. Regarding the service : Flipkart did an amazing job of very securely packaging the camera and accessories bundle with lots of bubblewrap etc. I got the package within 36 hours.

Now came the search for the not so perfect but still a great backpack for my gizmo. Requirement : Bag should be able to hold 2 lenses , one body and all other basic accessories. Budget : As I've spent a lot recently on the new DSLR , was not willing to go anything more than 2500. I was initially happy to go with the DigiFlip CB001 priced Rs.1099 , but after a lot of research and reading many reviews realized that the quality on DigiFlip was not so good with bad zippers , stiches coming loose etc. Then thought , when you're getting something why compromise on it's quality , especially when you have spent close to a lakh for your gizmos. So as Lowepro has a good reputation , I decided not to go any lower than Lowepro , one thing I understand about this bag is , it is pretty small in size , but still meets my requirement and quality is definitely top notch. It would not be fair if I recommend this to anybody without myself using it at first , but I am still happy with my decision vs my requirement. That's all for now , I am expecting my shipment by Tuesday max , will come back and give you a after purchase review. Cheers! Karthik Viswanathan Received - 5th May Hey guys , The Lowepro Photo Traveler 150 Camera Bag was delivered to me this morning , a little late than expected though. I was about to leave to work and couldn't really go through the bag much. 1st IMPRESSION : The bag looks very little in size ( which I knew it will ) . 2 ) No compromise on the bag's quality , good zippers and they are covered. 3 ) Partitions are satisfying and the Velcro is good. 4 ) The padding is magnificent and gives me confidence that my camera will be safe in there. 5 ) The bag doesn't weigh much and I like that , it was measured at 0.58Kgs by the logistics. 5 ) The bag is just about a feet in height and when I put it on , I couldn't control the smile on my face as I'm used to big trekking bags / rucksacks , but I still like it as it's from Lowepro and looks neat. TIP : Guys there are different sellers for most of the products on Flipkart , this bag is priced Rs.2528 by WS retail and Rs.1400 by White Rabbit , chose wisely. I've seen many people blindly just purchasing it from a overpriced seller just because his product shows up first. So please research more. That's all , I need to go back home and try working my camera with the bag as I'm ready to drive to Pondicherry on Friday night , my second trip with my new DSLR. Cheers!

There are many other bags available at a lesser price and are bigger than this one. I have written a detailed review of this bag on my blog subliminal whispers. With some intelligence I could cram all these into the bag : 1 ) Nikon D200 with 18 - 55 lens 2 ) Nikon battery charger 3 ) Nikon batteries – 2 nos 4 ) Sigma 28 - 105 lens 5 ) Sony a200 camera body 6 ) Sony 18 - 70 lens 7 ) Sony battery charger 8 ) Sony battery In the top panel : 1 ) Sony HDMI cable 2 ) A multi card reader 3 ) Sony power cable 4 ) Nikon power cable 5 ) One CF card 6 ) paddings that I removed from the bag Should you buy it? If you are a hobby shooter and have very less gear , you like Lowepro then yes , this bag is perfect for you , otherwise no. I tried exchanging but flipkart people told me its not possible. So be wise , think long and hard before ordering anything. Better check it out in shops before ordering online. Pros : Quality Cons : really small size Goodluck with your shopping ! Cheers !!!

Click on "Register Your Product" button. Follow the instructions displayed. During this registration process , keep a soft - copy of the Invoice , and your camera / lens' serial numbers ( these numbers are printed on the outer - right side panel of sealed box along with bar codes ) . The Camera body , 18 - 55 lens , 55 - 250 lens have unique serial numbers for each of them. All these three are to be registered one after the other. Typically the camera body serial number will have more digits than the lens. Let's use a hypothetical example , say these are the numbers found on the box : ( 11 ) 123456789012 , ( 22 ) 1234567890 , ( 33 ) 0987654321. The first one should be of the Camera body and the other two are of the Lenses. When registering , omit the content within parantheses and use the remaining part. Going by the same example considered above , you should use 123456789012 to register the camera body , and so on. If the above still fails : There is an option to raise an "Escalation" from Canon Edge India product registration web page itself. Basically , it's our opportunity to tell Canon India that a camera with the Serial Number is bought in India , on a specific date. Canon India immediately issues an Escalation Tracking ID on our e - mail. Internally , Canon India validates how the camera with the specific serial number came into India , whether it was a legal import by Canon India Pvt Ltd. , or not , whether it's a brand new camera / used one elsewhere , etc. , and they will inform the final status back to us on our e - mail ID. Assuming it is all genuine and Canon processed the escalation in our favor , product in our hand can be registered to avail warranty and other benefits. In case there is no response within , say , 5 to 10 working days : Carry the camera along with lenses , the box and the Invoice to your nearest Canon Service Center. They will be able to do a manual inspection & advise your options. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 60 of 61 users found this review helpful.

Ok , my first DSLR , this camera is excellent , lightweight enough and powerful. Has an APS - C sensor which is closely packed with 18 million light sensor pixels , more than excellent for an Entry Level , this enables the shots being rendered low in noise and grains under low light conditions or while using higher ISO. The 18 - 55mm IS II lens is though very slow ( or maybe stupid ) while in AF mode , so I almost always tend to use MF , this is not seen in the 55 - 250mm IS II , in fact the later is quite fast in AF registration , and equally smart in MF mode. The camera body has a good grip and feel unlike its predecessor , EOS 1100D which is kept by a friend of mine , which has more plastic feel. The EOS 1200D feels rubberized at the grips which is fantastic , it also has better control and switch placements than the previous. Still , no in - body image stabilization is a considerable drawback , Sony , Pentax are miles ahead than Canon and Nikon in this context. One point , I'm using this for almost a week , but still could not found where are the RAW and / or RAW+JPEG shooting modes hidden , well , I can refer to the manual , but , I think I should find it by myself , isn't it funny? If you plan to use old lenses using lens mount to EF - S adapters , this camera is a good choice as different modes , like Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority mode are quite easy to use , intelligent camera indeed for amateurs. Accessories provided are sufficient , the battery is quite capable in delivering 500+ shots in use after fully charged , USB cable , the Strap is good , free 8GB SD Card , CDs and manuals... Inference : Go ahead without hesitation , it'll amaze you , believe me. Never the less , there are other better models targeted at pro - s , still , this one is too good , maybe best and smartest as an Entry Level DSLR for amateurs and also for semi pro - s... Peace.

For the canon team a simple advice / feedback....the bag offered with the DSLR looks very cheap for a product offered at Rs.34000. I am big fan of the canon products but every time Canon has offered cheap bags with the cameras. Request you to rectify it.

With a D3100 / 3200 or D5000 / 5100 results are crisp. The AF motor is noise free and the grip is efficient. The VR functionality is a huge benefit but at 200mm a tripod is recommended unless you have very steady hands. All in all a brilliant experience!

Super Express Delivery and of course its Nikon Hats - off to Flipkart I placed order this lens of 7DEC2011 and I received in on 8DEC2011. Amazing flipkart. **** A good zoom lens but when you completely zoom in you need a steady hands else you will end up with a blur. Tripod is must at 200mm. Bad at focussing in low light conditions. Nothing much as of now as I have to test it. 5 stars for Flipkart. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 9 of 10 users found this review helpful.

Best product , Best Packaging , On time delivery! This is my first nikkor lens to fit in my Nikon DSLR D3100. As I ordered , all the necessary details was communicated to me by Flipkart. Bang On! The delivery was before committed deadline! The packaging was too good , as a fragile lens need a real good packaging. I couldnt complain! Coming to the product it is a basic lens that an amateur SLR photographer must have for everyday shooting. It has VR ( Vibration Reduction ) mechanism which comes very handy.

One aspect missing : AF / M setting which is a must on longer zooms. But , what the heck , if AF is so great I wouldnt need to use AF / M. The VR results in a taper off on sharpness - quite noticeable at long zooms. Most of my photographs are at about 150mm , with a vivid sharpness. I am wondering if a 3x extender instead on my 55mm would do better? This one lens and a 35mm prime is all I need for great photos! Happy clicking...

My main concern is the warranty of the product as when i crosschecked with Nikon customer Care they told me that they don't want to comment on this subject and they suggested me to purchase any product from Nikon Authorized retailer. as E retailer are not authorized by them. Coming to the product. Plastic Quality is not up to the mark even if you compare it with the tamron or sigma lens they are much better in terms of the plastic Quality. The other specifications are upto the mark specially the ED Lens , Trust me you won't get this type of lens under this Budget VR Mode is the Plus point.. as the Objects closed above 170MM are shaky So you need to turn on the VR mode to capture the object. a 55 - 300 lens is available at 22 , 000 rs in the market and investing 7500 rs in this type of lens is not a BAD deal.

Extremely bad packaging for a lens The packaging was extremely poor. The thermocol packaging was broken & I was afraid that the lens may have been damaged while opening the packaging. The lens box inside the thermocol had also paved in crushing the manual & the bill. THE SEAL ON THE LENS BOX WAS BROKEN AS WELL. I have absolutely no idea if I have received a brand new product or someone's hand me downs. Will definitely NEVER buy anything close to a lens from Flipkart. I guess they are ok just for the products less than 1000rs or something , so that the aftermath isn't very painful. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 9 of 12 users found this review helpful.

But still I wish the zoom would have been great if it was just till 250 mm. It has 2 years warranty , and folks when you buy this lens keep the box as warranty says that you need the box to claim the warranty. It comes with a Nikon lens pouch which is well built. It also comes with a hood ( not a flower one ) . Now when you attach the hood at 200 mm , It is twice the length of 18 - 55 mm at 55 mm. The looks of the lens are also awesome. Dx means can be mounted only on DSLRs and not SLRs. VR means Vibration Reduction. Folks always keep it ON as its very helpful for removing a little - bit of blurriness. The red VR logo is the cherry on top of a classic vanilla cake. Overall nice ( great ) product , and can recommend the lens straightaway to anyon who needs a zoom lens. Hats OFF Flipkart !!! But packaging could have been better. Hope my review helped you !!! Thank You !!! ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

Initially you will have to set up the connection with the computer and then enjoy transfer of pictures and videos hassle free. Most of the people couldn't connect because your Anti - Virus Firewall which might block the connection. Turn off firewall and you can easily connect or you can add you camera IP to Firewall. Sony Memories is one of the best App which have to install through which you can share your photo easily on facebook , picasa etc. and it organizes the photos very well. All and all a good buy for a lay man who doesn't know much about photography and just wants to use it in his daily life and capture those special moments.

Hope what Flipkart Does?? in packing they have given silver color camera pic and when i open it inside i got black color camera. So the package is done by the retailer simply unboxing the original and keep the warranty less one in it.

Flipkart service was very good and the freebies that came with the camera were also nice. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful.

Good Lens for Beginners Firstly you need to know that this is not the most amazing lens out there but its affordable. You get what you pay for. But saying that its an all round lens that will help take different kinds of photographs. The build is not really that great , made out of cheap plastic. But as i said you get what you pay for. Also i wanted to mention this lens has a inbuilt focus motor ( For Nikon Mount ) . I see no one has mentioned that clearly. Works nice with my D5100. But the motor is a little bit noisy ( compared to my 18 - 55 mm ) like a rc toy cars sound ( But no vibrations b'coz of it ) .

The picture quality is alright but not any where near to the quality of the pics i take with my Prime 35MM 1.8G. But this gives you a good feel of what you can generally expect out of a 18 - 200 MM. If you have more cash for the Nikon18 - 200MM the aperture is a bit more better plus it has VR. But for the price this is good. Plus the weight is light and its small in size.

Pure value for money Ever since I bought this product over 2 years ago , I have been only using this lens to take photos on my DSLR cameras. Excellent results , with the highest flexibility to use a single lens in all types of situations. Talking about size & weight , this lens is as big as & as heavy as the standard kit lens that comes along with your DSLR. However , the flexibility offered in terms of carrying a single lens ( instead of different lenses for different situations ) is unmatched. This lens is a true all rounder!

Read in an earlier review about the absence of VR feature ( which comes with Nikon lenses ), but truly speaking with a god gifted pair of steady hands & a tripod I don't miss the VR feature much. I also read in one of the review that the AF works slowly in low lights , well I can say that is partially true because it worked for me a couple of times but didn't worked many times , but only AF. MF works perfectly fine. The lens is very compact & not very heavy. The packet contains a lens hood as well. It also has a very useful "Lock feature" which enables you to ensure that the lens will not be damaged during traveling. Overall , a must have lens for beginners.

About Tamron lenses , I am greatly satisfied. I am using their AF 70 - 300 lens and now received 18 - 200. Tamron lenses are really a value for money product. The results are awesome and am very happy. VR is not available in Tamron lenses , however if your hands are steady , you will not regret in the quality. I recommend this product to all normal users , since i am also not a professional photographer. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

The combination of very high zoom and blur reduction gives you comfort in taking good photographs without much hazzard and technical info about photography. Have used 3 - 4 modes in these 3 months since I've bought the product. 42X Optical Zoom - This is the best thing abut the camera , when I took a picture of the moon , much to my surprise I could see the craters on the moon surface ( trust me , heavenly feeling! ) . Also birds and butterflies can be captured from a fairly large distance. Battery - Battery goes for long. From my experience , 2 days of almost full day photography and there was charge left for a birthday party. Manual Focus and Exposure Control - This is obviously a turn on for those who are planning for DSLR in the future , gives you a fair idea about how much exposure and shutter speed is needed keeping in mind the motion of the object and the light condition. Manual focus is not as manual as you'll find in DSLR but thumps up for keeping these features. The price range is justified though I bought it at a higher price.

I dnt think any other brand offers it in this price range and Nikon can't be compared to others.

CANON SX 50 HS ( 50x zoom , 1 / 2.3inch sensor -- The Best Choice ) 2. FujiFilm HS 50 EXR ( 42x zoom , 1 / 2inch sensor -- still a good choice ) 3. Panasonic FZ 200 ( 25x zoom , 2.8 constant aperture -- Great Choice ) 4. Sony DSC - HX300 ( 50x zoom , 1 / 2.3inch -- A safe buy for beginners ) And of course have a fifth option that is NIKON , full of Cons. Now let us discuss why! A. NIKKOR lens is slow , full of error ( aberrations ), aperture is extremely small in the tele end. B. Even Canon has the similar aperture ( smaller in the tele ends ) but its ISO Sensitivity is Super Fine , that more than compensates the smaller aperture. Even at 1600 ISO , Canon gives negligible noise. Whereas , in NIKON , you'll feel like vomiting if you look at pictures at 400 ISO. C. Image Stabilization : At any point beyond 20x zoom in any camera , what you'll need is a powerful image stabilizer , either a Optical of Digital one. All that matters is the result. FUJI Optical Image Stabilizer OR SONY DIGITAL STABILIZER works equally good but here CANON wins the bet. It combines Vibration Reducing Lens technology along with Digital Image Stabilizer ( Through DIGIC 5 Processor ) to give MARVELOUS result. The CANON frame - assist will blow your mind. Well , Nikon Image Stabilizer? Sssucsxxx. D. HOT SHOE : CANON / FUJI -- Yes *VS* NIKON -- No. ( Hot Shoe enables you to add external accessories like BOOM Mike or 2ndary Flash etc ) E. Digital Zoom Performance : While canon displays excellent result for upto 4x digital zoom , Nikon SUCKSSS even at 2x. F. AUTO Mode : If you are a beginner and depend much on Auto mode , better go for SONY of FUJI. Because auto modes much depends on SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE , hence companies like SONY or Samsung which has evident presence in software industry , excels in optimizing auto - mode performances. Result wise FUJI and CANON auto modes are also acceptable to good extent. But Nikon! Simply GOOD for Nothing. My nikon Point and Shoot fails in face - detection most of the times. G. Auto Focus : Here , FUJI excels. Takes 0.03 sec time to focus ( Phase Detect ) . Canon comes second with 0.16 sec ( Contrast Detect ) . With these two cameras , you're safe. It reduces chances of being out - of - focus in fast moving situations. In my own experience , NIKON TAKES AT LEAST 2 SECOND TO FOCUS. H. FUJI and SONY features a vivid range of different shooting modes which ease your shooting. Nikon features much less ( Just use COMPARE option in flipkart ) . I. PICTURE QUALITY : Canon -- You'll love it. Even at Full Crop , they are crisp. SONY -- Its good too. But at full crop it'll look like oil paint. Still better than Noise. FUJI -- Somewhat OK. But at full zoom some noise appears Panasonic -- EXCELLENT. NIKON -- In daylight : Not Bad. In Low Light : You'll Vomit on them. J. AFTER SALES : Fuji features dealer's after sales ( The shop you buy from will take care of any issues ) . You don't have to spend hours on internet finding Service Center , though it has quite good amount of Service Centers across India. Also Canon has enough service centers across cities in India but Panasonic Lags in this field. Well. Now Nikon : Yes you'll manage to find one or two service centers in your metro cities but my own experience is pretty bad. The service guys cant see the noise spots on your display screen of dont understand lowlight performance issues. Even inside a room full of lights my camera needs Flash to capture faster than 1 / 40 speed and as per the Service Guy , this is quite good performance. So here's my arguement based on personal experiences. DONT BUY NIKON. It'll frustrate you on every single occurrances.

Let's compare it closest Canon competitor , 550D! I've used both products , and also own D5100 , so I guess the review will be useful for many! Why you should go for Canon 550D? 1. Well well , street price is lower , you can actually buy some low end camera with that difference.. 2. Built - in focus motor.. This is most important reason why you should go for 550D than D5100. It will save your hell lot of money on your further lens purchases.. You will not need to go for lenses with built - in auto - focus motor , which are much more costly. 3. More megapixels..

You will not need to go for lenses with built - in auto - focus motor , which are much more costly. 3. More megapixels.. About 2 megapixels more.. ( Does not bother me much , but bothers few people for sure! ) 4. Smaller , thinner and lighter , though not very much! 2.4 inches compared to 3.1 inches.. and 530gm against 560gm! lol... 5. Now on some sites I read that it has lesser start up delay and less shutter lag , but the lag is in few milliseconds , you won't even recognize unless you use both cams for couple of years , separately.. 6. Allegedly , better video quality! 7. Better resolution of live - view - screen , c'mon , nothing related to camera quality though! Now , did you notice that except built - in motor and more megapixels , everything else are physical attributes , nothing really connected to photo quality , now lets see why you should go for Nikon D5100? 1. Canon delivers better video quality , but does not auto - focus once the shooting starts.. Will annoy you if the subject moves towards you! 2. The screen has lesser resolution , but flips out and rotates , amazing feature , trust me! 3. Larger sensor , well , APS C of Nikon ( DX ) is same as standard APS C , but Canon APS C is a little smaller than that! ( 23.6mmX15.6mm vs 22.3mmX14.9mm , believe me , each nanometer counts! ) 4. Better colour depth as each manual shouts , 23.5 bits vs 22.1 bits , well , that means better image quality. 5. More focus points , 11 vs 9 , yup that counts! 6. shoots at 4 fps vs 3.7 fps of canon 7. longer battery life , well , something that I have experienced. The capacity says the other way round though , 1120 mAH vs 1030mAH. I guess Nikon engine is more efficient! Also , I find Canon batteries a little costlier than Nikon. 8. Larger ISO 9. Has in camera HDR , awesome , captures two photos at different exposure and combines them to give exact picture as seen by naked eye! That's really cool , something which you cannot do with Photoshop that effectively once the image has been captured! 10. In - camera effects , that's awesome , especially to show - off in front of photography - illiterate people , or photo - editing - illiterate I would say.. : ' ) 11. Allegedly , better image quality at higher ISO owing to more dynamic EV range. So , I guess the winner is Nikon D5100!

You cant go wrong with each one of them. If your area of interest is "Real Photography" , I would suggest Nikon D5100. But if you are a "Photography Video Enthusiast" , canon 550D might suit you better. For me I picked Nikon D5100 , because would like to horn my Photography skills. As far as Value of Money and Delivery is concerned , Its very hard for another E - commerce site to beat FlipKart.... Happy shopping guys !!

So the battles of thoughts are finally over! :) Like you , even i was confused... Nikon D5100 or Canon 600D? I had spend months trying to decide the same. And whenever i was about to decide on one , the thoughts of other came and haunted me :/ On top of those , the reviews and 'expert' advises of friends... My situation was hopeless :) But on 24th July 2013 , i declared an end to the war! Yes , i had a bias towards Nikon. But that was not the only reason for selecting Nikon...

And whenever i was about to decide on one , the thoughts of other came and haunted me :/ On top of those , the reviews and 'expert' advises of friends... My situation was hopeless :) But on 24th July 2013 , i declared an end to the war! Yes , i had a bias towards Nikon. But that was not the only reason for selecting Nikon... Since i had gone through the pain and torture of this selection process , i thought i would pen down , here , what worked for me... Who knows , may be this would help some of you! First some facts : 1. There is no 'the best' or 'the better' here. Both are absolutely worth the money you spend. 2. If its the photography that you are interested in , then N 5100 is the one for you. But if it is video too , then C 600D 2. I felt Canon to be more user friendly. Also , while holding Canon , you feel full. Hope you got what i meant! Where as Nikon gives you a kinda light weight stuff feeling. But after using Nikon for a while , i am very comfortable with it. 3. Also , Never make the mistake of comparing pictures taken in both by looking at the LCD screen in camera. Canon has a sharper LCD screen. So , if you want to compare the pictures , copy it in a laptop / tab and see it. Much better option would be taking print and analyzing it. 4. Now the much hyped 'built in motor'. Its quite natural if it confuses you. Just chuck it! But if you just cant , open 2 pages and compare Nikon and Canon Lenses side by side. You would discover that both are costlier no matter what. So... no point in worrying about it... Besides , once you buy a particular brand , i dont think you would think "oh my god , the other brand lenses are cheap!" Instead you would only be looking at the same brand lenses and compatible lenses. Now how would you select : 1. Walk into reliance digital or QRS or something of that sort and ask for a demo of these 2 devices and take couple of pics too. As you go home , you would have decided on the user friendliness factor. 2. Ask yourself which brand you are more inclined to. Start watching youtube videos on that rather than watching both Nikon and Canon videos. It helps : p 3. Now , once these 2 are over , you keep a watch on the prices in Flipkart , eBay etc... There will an offer one day or another. I had to wait it a bit long , but it proved to be worth. I bought it for 28104 ( 24th July 2013 ) . When converted to EMI ( 6 months ) the total cost became 28500. It was a pretty good deal that time ( normal price was 31k ) . With 4gb card and carry case :) My Exp with Nikon D5100 : Absolutely worth the money i spend for... Learning phase is great.. Besides , the wow factor that appears on others face. I recently ( August 2014 ) added Nikkor 35mm f1.8G ( affordable bokeh lenses - 7.6k ) . I am pretty happy with the pics i take. One thing is for sure , when you start experimenting with it , you will automatically graduate to the next level of photography.. So dont worry about your present expertise level. All you need is a creative mind. Also , never worry about the lenses you have to add. Start with the basic lens. As you progress you will realize what is your specialty ( zoom , bokeh , landscape , portrait etc ) . Once you finds that out , purchase lenses accordingly rather than just adding with out any purpose. So happy shopping and enjoy your camera. Gook luck :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 18 of 18 users found this review helpful.

Thanks Flipkart.com for the super fast delivery of the product in good condition. Nikon D5100 DSLR , is placed between Entry level and Pro level DSLR cameras from Nikon. Precisely between D3100 and D7000. Before zeroing on the D5100 I did my own research about Nikon and Canon.

Thanks Flipkart.com for the super fast delivery of the product in good condition. Nikon D5100 DSLR , is placed between Entry level and Pro level DSLR cameras from Nikon. Precisely between D3100 and D7000. Before zeroing on the D5100 I did my own research about Nikon and Canon. Since Nikon and Canon are the leading brands in Camera Optics , it was easier to ignore the others in the trade. I specifically compared Nikon D5100 Vs. Canon EOS 600D. The Specs looked quite similar , except that the Nikon D5100 has a slight edge over the Canon EOS 600D in terms of Image capturing , quality of images , color and details of images. The Canon scored the brownie points in terms of Video shooting. Being Nikon fan , it was easier for me to opt / choose for NIKON DSLR as my next. Before Graduating to NIKON DSLR , I have used Nikon Point - n - Shoot ( Nikon Coolpix L20 ) and a Bridge camera ( Super zoom Nikon Coolpix P80 ) . Product Details : NIKON are very good at Optics in terms of IMAGING. Their EXSPEED Processors built into their cameras are exceptionally built and are of high quality image processing unit. The D5100 has Exspeed II Processor which is very good are processing the image captured and then saving it ont he Data storage ( Internal storage or External storage ) . The sensor is of 16.2 mega pixel DX format CMOS sensor. Advantage of Nikon D5100 over Canon EOS 600D or for that matter even other brands ( Sony alpha DSLRs ) are as below : a ) 11 Point Auto focus system over Canon's 9 Point. b ) Lighter in weight than that of Canon EOS 600D c ) Slightly Cheaper in price compared to Canon. d ) Greater Color depth 23.5 bits as compared to Canon EOS 600D e ) Wide Dynamic range 13.0 EV f ) Images are sharper and less / low noise at high ISO Sensitivity while capturing snaps. g ) The NIKON D5100 has in camera HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) where as the Canon EOS 600D does not have HDR in built. h ) Nikon D5100 has larger Sensor @ 23.6mm x 15.6 mm Vs. 22.3mm x 14.9mm of that of Canon. ( Hence more light enters into the sensor and better image capturing experience ) i ) The Shutter lag is less than that of Canon EOS 600D. ( 273 mili seconds Vs. 283 mili seconds ) j ) The Nikon D5100 shoots at a faster rate of 4fps ( frames per second ) that than of Canon at 3.7 fps. k ) Has additional Special Effects option on the Mode dial with around 5 - 7 special effects for better and innovative image capture. l ) One specific observation I have noticed is that at low ISO settings , the D5100 is equal with the best of the competition Canon EOS 600d , Nikon D3100 , but at the higher ISO settings , it produces some of the best image quality that on would have ever seen from an APS - C sensor camera. m ) The it lens provided with this product ( Nikon D5100 ) is good for getting you started with DSLR. A good all purpose lens at a cheaper price but is worth using for your start - up into DSLR photography. n ) The lens is of focal length 18mm - 55 mm G type lens. it is quite good at capturing your subject's image at a wider range. o ) Both Nikon and Canon have a good repository of lenses to choose from. p ) The kit lens of Nikon is quite good , but I would only suggest to go for additional lens once you have got a good hang of DSLRs . One all purpose zoom lens ( Tamron or Sigma ), one Prime lens of 50 MM f1.8 aperture fixed focal length for outdoors is a must have in your lens collection. q ) I observed that the Battery life of Nikon D5100 is pretty good at capturing even the high resolution images. So at a Medium size image capture the number of images would increase and save battery life. r ) The LCD Menu is easy to understand and with the help button in hand on the rear body of the camera it serves as a good tutorial as well. s ) The Live view on the Tilting LCD screen is great to have. But the only problem here is that it takes quite a split of a second to focus on the subject. t ) Image quality is definitely the D5100's trump card. It offers effectively the same image quality as the higher - end D7000 , at a lower cost , and it's hard to argue that this is not a good thing. The final word from my side is : The Nikon D5100 is without doubt one of the most compelling and competitive products in its class compared to Canon and Sony , and offers an excellent mixture of straightforward handling , a well - targeted feature set , and excellent video and still image quality. As we'd expect from a camera with such a solid lineage , the D5100 is responsive and reliable in operation , and produces excellent images with a minimum of fuss. Overall , I am very satisfied with the product bought and would definitely recommend the Nikon D5100 DSLR to someone for his / her first choice as a beginner DSLR camera. - Cheers!!

I am very satisfied with my Nikon D5100 + 35mm f / 1.8 , would recommend both wholeheartedly to anybody considering a DSLR. My review is to help others buying their first DSLR make a decision. Firstly , all DSLRs take excellent photos and videos too. I believe that no one brand is MUCH better than the others 1. Budget : Whatever your budget , buy at least one good lens to suit your needs. Don't spend your full budget on a DSLR + kit lens *UNLESS* the kit lens is really enough. Good lenses help take good photos. If your budget is around 35k , consider a camera for under 30k with kit + at least one more lens to suit your needs. 2. Lenses : What type of photography do you plan on doing? Indoors / outdoors , portraits / landscapes , kids / pets etc.? Your satisfaction with any DSLR depends heavily on your choice of lenses to match your needs. Research a little and find what focal length / aperture / zoom and PRICE suits your needs. 3. Camera control : Understand your needs. If you are new to photography in general or don’t want to fidget with settings but still want to take good photos , too many buttons may not be needed , or just get in the way and overwhelm you. A camera that takes good pictures in "Auto" may better suit you. Nikon is usually the best at doing everything well automatically. As you learn more , you can fine tune all of your Nikon DSLR's 'Auto' settings too! 4. Features : All cameras offer broadly the same features , but here is why in the entry to upper - entry segment , I believe Nikon DSLRs are the best -- feature wise : -- Intelligent Auto ISO : Set MIN ISO , MAX ISO *AND* MIN Shutter speed. Other DSLRs have a button to adjust ISO , but with this Nikon feature , you will rarely ever need to adjust ISO again! It's not found on the 600D , no idea about the 1200D. -- Customizable White Balance presets : All Nikon DSLRS allow you to customize every WB preset to your tastes including Auto. Plus one custom setting too! As far as I know , you will not find this on entry level DSLRs. -- Nine Custom picture styles in camera + 99 on SD card. You can also transfer these to a different Nikon DSLR , so your custom picture styles will be with you as long as you use Nikon DSLRs. -- Menu history tab. Nikon menus are simple anyway. But they also have a history tab. Your most recently changed setting are saved. Even if you changed one item in playback menu , one from shooting menu , one from touch up menu , the history tab stores them. You may never have to keep navigating the entire menu again after just a short while of using your Nikon DSLR. Neat! -- Easy live view / Movie mode : Nikon beats Canons here. Push one lever to lock the mirror up , Live view starts , press the movie record button. Movie recording begins. No need to turn the mode dial. -- Live view / Movie autofocus. The Nikon D3x00 / D5x00 and above will do this. Not all other brands of entry / upper entry DSLRs offer movie autofocus. It's not super - fast , but it's better than manual focus! -- In - camera RAW to JPEG. Some competing entry level DSLRs lack this feature. All Nikon DSLRs have it. All DSLRs should have this. Non - pro buyers at this price point are unlikely to want to process their RAW files on their PC / Laptop , especially if they only occasionally need to adjustment white balance / color tone. -- Reliable exposure metering : Nikons are generally believed to have reliable exposure metering , with / without flash. Other entry / upper entry DSLRs are generally a small step down , my research suggests. You may still have to apply exposure compensation but you won't find yourself needing to change it often or have your subject under / over exposed when you least expected it on a Nikon. Overall , Nikons entry / upper entry DSLRs are better suited to users who want to take great photos , with minimum fuss , and don't want to spend a lot of time changing settings or post processing images. Nikons are generally perceived to be more reliable and rugged , and built to last. Also , Nikon make great lenses at many price points and you get lots of accessories for them , so it's not a brand you will ever have to worry about starting out with. One last point. D3xx / D5xx , it can get confusing. Here is my advice : - 24 vs 16 MP : You will benefit from 24 MP if ( a ) you have good lenses that can resolve 24 MP OR you shoot with apertures 5.6 or smaller for max sharpness , ( b ) you shoot at low ISOs , never over ISO 800 , and ( c ) you need to take small crops or make big enlargements often. Otherwise , the only difference between 24 vs 16 MP are larger file sizes. - Swiveling screen. The D5xxx range has it , D3xxx doesn’t. It’s a great feature and worth having. - Overall price / performance / VFM / image quality : In my opinion , the D5100 is the clear winner here , compared to other Nikon DSLRs and other brands too , in the 30k segment. Happy shooting :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 9 of 9 users found this review helpful.

Eagerly waiting for this camera to arrive before I leave for the holiday. But now it seems I will have to go on my holiday without this camera. I would advise everyone to think twice before making advance payment. COD would be better. Update on 10th Dec Even after repeated reminders & requests to the Callous Flipkart Customer care & Customer Support the Camera has not yet been delivered to me. Nobody in Flipkart has any clue what - so - ever about its current status. Everyone is giving vague replies & empty assurances after conveniently pocketing my hard earned Rs 28920.

Purchasing your first DSLR camera can be a hectic exercise to your fingers and eyes & Yes ! more amount of internet data usage. Reviewing lots of videos on You tube , lots of links for different comparisons between Nikon and Canon needs to be done.

I chose D5100 because during my searching process I found It a high - end beginners camera at a starting Price. So just have this in your hands and wait for the magic. Comparison leads to confusion without any conclusions at some places but still if you compare it with its successors and predecessors ( D5200 , D5000 , D3100 and D3200 ) it is a good machine to Grow your third eye in budget. One more thing , don't look for the Megapixels. This is just a technical term unless there is a difference like 8 Megapixels and 24 Megapixels. Don't forget , you still like that digital picture taken by a mobile VGA camera in resolution of 128X160 pixels. As I can see in some reviews , problems about registering the product. I registered it easily. & for flipkart , Change your name to Quickkart. :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 7 of 7 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Abhishek Mumbai Sep 20 , 2011 Simply Amazing ! Hi , I upgraded my camera from Fuji Fine Pix 2000 HD to DSLR after doing lot of research , I was about to take the Nikon D3100 as I can not afford the D7000 but this camera is you can say having most quality that D7000 is offering. I am happy to buy this & Having no complained till date. But for new user I would say take this machine only when you have the passion of the camera as it requires lot of care. For complete utilization of this camera , you will have to take one 70 mm to 300 mm lense as 17 - 55 mm lense is not sufficient enough.

Since it is FX format lens , cropping will happen while using with DX format cameras like D3000 / 3100 / 5100 / D90 / D7000 etc. But good thing is that , you will get sharpest image while cropping the aberrant sides and corners of the frame. Image quality is simply awesome. 5 stars for that...!! I tried this tiny lens on my D5100 , setting up the aperture f11 and set up soft box flashes. The result was awesome and unbelievable image quality.. i couldnt even find a noise / spot even zoomed the pic in to maximum level.

From my personal experience , i could say this is the best , sharper , faster ( thanks to SWM mechanism ) Nikor lens which comes for a nominal price.

But best bang for buck is this one. and also to note this is a FX lens so you get 75mm on a DX body like D3100 , D5100 , D7000 which is actually excellent for portraits!

Best prime lens at this price Thanx to flipkart for a swift 2 days delivery , i got this today for my nikon D3100 dslr. I bought this lens for its creamy out of focus blur or what professionals call bokeh.And i must say this lens does an amazing job at bokeh for my portrait and low light photography. Razor sharp fast auto focus , bright pictures even at low light. Anyone using their stock lens on a DSLR is missing out the amazing potential of this thing.

I give 5**** for both this lens for giving quality pictures in both High & low light.Its does a good job while shooting indoors. Both prime lens works great in all situations. It collects more light and allows you to shoot at higher shutter speeds to get crystal clear picture. Don't think too much. Just go for it. My advice is buy both 35mm & 50mm prime lens. Now flipkart is giving it for half of its orginal price. I received my new 50mm prime lens 4 days back for 7678. When you are gonna get a lens for half of its present market price pls dont think too much about warranty issues. That is one useless point. A lens will start behaving bad only if u mishandle it. Always remember you will not get Warranty for mishandled products. so play safe with every lens & simply give them the best care. They will never disappoint you. Next point is pls dont compare 35mm vs 50mm prime lens too much. 50mm will zoom more when compared to 35mm. Thats the only differece. 35mm plays an important role When i do indoor group photography bcoz its wide enough to capture every one , some times with 50mm you may not get too much space to step back to accomadate every one in to one single frame correctly. I find 35mm is perfect for taking wide photographs. 35mm acts as 50mm and 50mm act as 75 mm in my cam ( D5100 ), Just get a18 - 105 mm lens to know how much difference it makes with 50mm and 75mm zoom. My advice is get both. Now the question is if you have a camera with an inbuilt auto - focus motor should i buy one of this. I would say buy 35 mm or 50 mmG lens only. Nikkor AF 50mm f / 1.8D lensis available for Rs.5670. This model doesnt have am auto - focus motor but now flipkar is giving both lens below 8000 bucks so definitely its a good buy go for it boys. You are gonna find all other lens not crunchy , not sharp enough , too hefty and too expensive for their image quality . I received my 50mm lens 4 days back. Seller : WS Retail. 5***** for len , 5***** for WS Retail & 5***** for flipkarts superb service & packing So friends what are you waiting for?

Consusion between 35mm and 50mm 1.8f : Take ur nikon camrea , set it to 35mm and see the area getting covered during snaps. Then set it to 50mm and see the area getting covered. If u want wide angle more then u can go for 35mm. But plese note follwing : 1. 50mm lens is having excellent bokeh better than 35mm 2. Fast autofocus than 35mm. Potraits means half body or face.U can cover full body by keeping cam vertical. So dont get confuse between 35mm and 50mm , go for this if despertely dont want wide angle.. Go for this , you wont regret. Amit Patil Navi Mumbai ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse</DIV></DIV>

At the lowest f2.8 setting , the bokeh is very smooth and isolates the subject pleasingly. Works great as a portrait lens or as general purpose lens. Go for the 50mm if cost or low light is critical. It's cheaper by around 5K and it goes down to f1.8 for shooting at low light. The better build quality of the 40mm means it may last longer in use and you can always use ISO6400 in low light to get the shot. EDIT : As of Dec 2013 , the 40mm is only 2K costlier than the 50mm f1.8. This tilts the balance more in favor of the 40mm. You can always get a slightly wider shot and crop to get the 50mm equivalent in most cases. The only real reason to go for the 50mm is if you are very much set on the f1.8.

I bought this lens from Flipkart when the price was around ~9k with some 5% offers. I had a 50mm 1.8 prime lens before , which I had sold off since I found the view too 'narrow' for my uses. ( Although great for portraits , I could hardly use it outdoors without backing up a lot ) . This 40mm fits the bill perfectly as a walk - around lens. Good for portraits , as well as for street photography. The sharpness is awesome , and the bokeh is pretty smooth and nice too. Overall , if you already own the 18 - 55 , and if you're wondering the next lens to invest in , go for this one! I also have the 55 - 25… I bought this lens from Flipkart when the price was around ~9k with some 5% offers.

The best lens for street photography. If you are travelling a lot and want to take photos of the people on the street then this lens is a must. Please note that I am not a pro. only a very amateurish amateur. Pros : 1 ) Compact. 2 ) Crystal clear photography at normal ( day ) light. 3 ) Auto focusing is fast. Cons : 1 ) Not so good at low light. Some times grains are visible. In one sentence , I am satisfied. I am using this lens since August 2013. 4 star from my end. ( one star less as not so good at low light photography. ) Regards. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 2 of 2 users found this review helpful.

I have used quite a few prime lens , and Helios 44M - 6 had been my favorite so far...for its color , contrast and beautiful swirly bokehs. But now , after using this 40mm , I think this STM is one of the best affordable prime lenses that any canon dslr customer would love. Period!

Awesome pics but slow focus on 600D I have been using micro meter kit lens , prime lens and zoom lens with my canon 600d. After viewing lot of 40mm lens reviews and pics on flikr I decided to give 40mm STM a try. Below are pros and cons and you may have difference of opinion depending on your field of photography. Pros : 1. Sharp , crisp and vivid pictures , can be compared with USM prime lenses. 2. Considering budget this one is Good for low light photography ( not as good as 50mm prime ) 3. Good for portraits , closeups , macro ( I did some and its ok ) and street photography. 4.

Read the cons if and only if you are a pro - photographer because as a newbie if you switch to 40mm STM , you will be amazed that your kit lens sucks and you just need to be really good at manual focus to get awesome pics with 40mm stm. Explore 40mm flickr community it may just compel you to buy this lens. Cons : 1. Images have bit of vignetting. 2. Not so handy on crop - sensor cameras ( but budget is quite appealing ) . Better use kit lens 18 - 55mm for indoor pics. 3. Very slow focus. Quite irritating while taking moving objects like wedding photography or sports event. 4. Not as fast as 50mm prime for low light indoor pics. 5. No Image stabilization ( can be ignored ) 6.

Outdoor pictures are great , nice & sharp details , give high resolution pics ( 16megapixel ) . Auto mode is awesome , other shooting modes for example super vivid , low light , long exposure , Live modes are super too , helps you in customize the shots. The P mode is available for fully personalized pic taking for experienced hands. Auto generally does all the job for you and does it great. three type of Auto Focus frame are available , Face detection , tracking and center. Three types of Focus available : Near , Normal , Infinity Three types of powerful flash : Auto , On , Slow Sync Digital Zoom is great but hard to take a stable shot with full zoom on. Video Recording is awesome , HD videos at 25fps , downside : If ur using the cam in low light indoors & flash if off , it will produce noise or darker images. Try switching to Auto with flash on or to low light mode with Flash on , and it will do the trick. All in all great Cam for starters an light occasional picture taking in a very low price.

Haven't tested it by running to 0 charge. (-) - battery + battery compartment can give you troubles , beware. the battery goes into the compartment either ways , but you will be able to close the battery cover flap only on the correct alignment. - the battery cover flap is quite delicate. - flash range is less for a large group photo in low light. i was scared i will break it I will rate the camera 4 ( 1 star less for the battery compartment and battery cover flap ) rating for seller / deliver still remains 1 star!

I had mentioned all the reasoning dropped mails , made calls , researched about the error on canons website and got to know that the error is because of some mechanical malfunction... buy now It was really an worst experience shopping online just to save a few bucks... anyways i had to do everything on my part so i decided to visit the canon service center ..they said it was a firmware issue updated the same returned me back my canon camera ...at the end i feel no one is there to be blamed for the product as it was sealed packed but my experience shopping with flipkart was horrible the seller kharidiye and also Flip kart lacks in timely communication after the sale has been made..When there has been a replacement and complaint launched there has to be a prompt and effective response as a customer we can at least expect this..they said we will resolve the case either replace the product or give me my money back it was suppose to happen in 48 hours ..10 days have passed by i did all the running that was required but still flipkart and kharidiye are yet to reply..hope this review is read analyzed and acted upon so that hence forth your clients are satisfied and they return to give you more business..

After 2 or 3 days issue started occurring repeatedly and one of my friend checked this and told there is something wrong with this camera. Raised the issue to Flipkart , Flipkart initiated the return procedure. Seller rejected the return with message "Manufacturer warranty product , go to the service center please". I reached the service center by 9th of December and asked for replacement as it is defective from the day it is taken out from the box. Service center person told replacement can be claimed only within 7 days from the date of invoice , my invoice date is on 29th November and i received the product only on 4th December. So i have to be there by 6th to claim replacement but since i am not aware of this i went bit late ( Dec 9th , after the weekend ) . Finally they checked the camera body and lens and told it is problem with one of the lens and they repaired the lens part. Now i am not getting those issues , but do note that ( for Canon ) you have to go to service center within a week to get the replacement done.

Bought this camera only to discover that the seal was tampered with and there was an attempt to seal it again with a secondary seal. Didn't open it and returned to flipkart. They shipped another camera. With the same problem. Exactly the same problem. The seal was broken again. Don't trust Flipkart with their vendor selection , they're taking customers for granted.

Second , regarding product warranty - Cambay has also sent invoice with supplier seal , along with the warranty card. Warranty card does not carry any seal , but having checked with canon shop , they clarified that it is ok if you have invoice with seal. It may also be good to check with canon support to let them register ( donno if it works out , but trying ) . I have also verified that , exif info available as part of every image captured by this camera shows same serial number as in camera body - just to avoid hidden surprises! UPDATE : I just got my cam and lens kits registered in canonedge. It seems like , we do lil extra work here ( online purchase ) . First , in canonedge , create your login. While you validate your kit serial number ( s ), it would fail. Then I had shoot out mail to their customer support as well as canonedge admin ( check their FAQ ) . They assured it would be done quickly , but waited for 3 days. Then finally , the moment I escalated using their portal support , things got in place - This package s fully registered for two yrs warranty - no worries! ... :) Third , regarding freebie - no issue with SD card. reg bag , it can accommodate only the body and one lens at a time , though you can freeze both lens with some squeezing , but not recommending for long time ( buy a d - slr modular carry / back bag for that! ) . But not bad in terms of its padding foam and material quality ( inner as well as outer ) . Other stuffs that come along with it as they say ( battery charger , cables ) - and not finding any problem with them. Appreciating FK for consistently maintaining quick and safe delivery.

Let's compare it closest Canon competitor , 550D! I've used both products , and also own D5100 , so I guess the review will be useful for many! Why you should go for Canon 550D? 1. Well well , street price is lower , you can actually buy some low end camera with that difference.. 2. Built - in focus motor.. This is most important reason why you should go for 550D than D5100. It will save your hell lot of money on your further lens purchases.. You will not need to go for lenses with built - in auto - focus motor , which are much more costly. 3. More megapixels..

You will not need to go for lenses with built - in auto - focus motor , which are much more costly. 3. More megapixels.. About 2 megapixels more.. ( Does not bother me much , but bothers few people for sure! ) 4. Smaller , thinner and lighter , though not very much! 2.4 inches compared to 3.1 inches.. and 530gm against 560gm! lol... 5. Now on some sites I read that it has lesser start up delay and less shutter lag , but the lag is in few milliseconds , you won't even recognize unless you use both cams for couple of years , separately.. 6. Allegedly , better video quality! 7. Better resolution of live - view - screen , c'mon , nothing related to camera quality though! Now , did you notice that except built - in motor and more megapixels , everything else are physical attributes , nothing really connected to photo quality , now lets see why you should go for Nikon D5100? 1. Canon delivers better video quality , but does not auto - focus once the shooting starts.. Will annoy you if the subject moves towards you! 2. The screen has lesser resolution , but flips out and rotates , amazing feature , trust me! 3. Larger sensor , well , APS C of Nikon ( DX ) is same as standard APS C , but Canon APS C is a little smaller than that! ( 23.6mmX15.6mm vs 22.3mmX14.9mm , believe me , each nanometer counts! ) 4. Better colour depth as each manual shouts , 23.5 bits vs 22.1 bits , well , that means better image quality. 5. More focus points , 11 vs 9 , yup that counts! 6. shoots at 4 fps vs 3.7 fps of canon 7. longer battery life , well , something that I have experienced. The capacity says the other way round though , 1120 mAH vs 1030mAH. I guess Nikon engine is more efficient! Also , I find Canon batteries a little costlier than Nikon. 8. Larger ISO 9. Has in camera HDR , awesome , captures two photos at different exposure and combines them to give exact picture as seen by naked eye! That's really cool , something which you cannot do with Photoshop that effectively once the image has been captured! 10. In - camera effects , that's awesome , especially to show - off in front of photography - illiterate people , or photo - editing - illiterate I would say.. : ' ) 11. Allegedly , better image quality at higher ISO owing to more dynamic EV range. So , I guess the winner is Nikon D5100!

You cant go wrong with each one of them. If your area of interest is "Real Photography" , I would suggest Nikon D5100. But if you are a "Photography Video Enthusiast" , canon 550D might suit you better. For me I picked Nikon D5100 , because would like to horn my Photography skills. As far as Value of Money and Delivery is concerned , Its very hard for another E - commerce site to beat FlipKart.... Happy shopping guys !!

So the battles of thoughts are finally over! :) Like you , even i was confused... Nikon D5100 or Canon 600D? I had spend months trying to decide the same. And whenever i was about to decide on one , the thoughts of other came and haunted me :/ On top of those , the reviews and 'expert' advises of friends... My situation was hopeless :) But on 24th July 2013 , i declared an end to the war! Yes , i had a bias towards Nikon. But that was not the only reason for selecting Nikon... Since i had gone through the pain and torture of this selection process , i thought i would pen down , here , what worked for me... Who knows , may be this would help… Like you , even i was confused... Nikon D5100 or Canon 600D? I had spend months trying to decide the same.

My situation was hopeless :) But on 24th July 2013 , i declared an end to the war! Yes , i had a bias towards Nikon. But that was not the only reason for selecting Nikon... Since i had gone through the pain and torture of this selection process , i thought i would pen down , here , what worked for me... Who knows , may be this would help some of you! First some facts : 1. There is no 'the best' or 'the better' here. Both are absolutely worth the money you spend. 2. If its the photography that you are interested in , then N 5100 is the one for you. But if it is video too , then C 600D 2. I felt Canon to be more user friendly. Also , while holding Canon , you feel full. Hope you got what i meant! Where as Nikon gives you a kinda light weight stuff feeling. But after using Nikon for a while , i am very comfortable with it. 3. Also , Never make the mistake of comparing pictures taken in both by looking at the LCD screen in camera. Canon has a sharper LCD screen. So , if you want to compare the pictures , copy it in a laptop / tab and see it. Much better option would be taking print and analyzing it. 4. Now the much hyped 'built in motor'. Its quite natural if it confuses you. Just chuck it! But if you just cant , open 2 pages and compare Nikon and Canon Lenses side by side. You would discover that both are costlier no matter what. So... no point in worrying about it... Besides , once you buy a particular brand , i dont think you would think "oh my god , the other brand lenses are cheap!" Instead you would only be looking at the same brand lenses and compatible lenses. Now how would you select : 1. Walk into reliance digital or QRS or something of that sort and ask for a demo of these 2 devices and take couple of pics too. As you go home , you would have decided on the user friendliness factor. 2. Ask yourself which brand you are more inclined to. Start watching youtube videos on that rather than watching both Nikon and Canon videos. It helps : p 3. Now , once these 2 are over , you keep a watch on the prices in Flipkart , eBay etc... There will an offer one day or another. I had to wait it a bit long , but it proved to be worth. I bought it for 28104 ( 24th July 2013 ) . When converted to EMI ( 6 months ) the total cost became 28500. It was a pretty good deal that time ( normal price was 31k ) . With 4gb card and carry case :) My Exp with Nikon D5100 : Absolutely worth the money i spend for... Learning phase is great.. Besides , the wow factor that appears on others face. I recently ( August 2014 ) added Nikkor 35mm f1.8G ( affordable bokeh lenses - 7.6k ) . I am pretty happy with the pics i take. One thing is for sure , when you start experimenting with it , you will automatically graduate to the next level of photography.. So dont worry about your present expertise level. All you need is a creative mind. Also , never worry about the lenses you have to add. Start with the basic lens. As you progress you will realize what is your specialty ( zoom , bokeh , landscape , portrait etc ) . Once you finds that out , purchase lenses accordingly rather than just adding with out any purpose. So happy shopping and enjoy your camera. Gook luck :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 18 of 18 users found this review helpful.

Since Nikon and Canon are the leading brands in Camera Optics , it was easier to ignore the others in the trade. I specifically compared Nikon D5100 Vs. Canon EOS 600D. The Specs looked quite similar , except that the Nikon D5100 has a slight edge over the Canon EOS 600D in terms of Image capturing , quality of images , color and details of images. The Canon scored the brownie points in terms of Video shooting. Being Nikon fan , it was easier for me to opt / choose for NIKON DSLR as my next. Before Graduating to NIKON DSLR , I have used Nikon Point - n - Shoot ( Nikon Coolpix L20 ) and a Bridge camera ( Super zoom Nikon Coolpix P80 ) . Product Details : NIKON are very good at Optics in terms of IMAGING. Their EXSPEED Processors built into their cameras are exceptionally built and are of high quality image processing unit. The D5100 has Exspeed II Processor which is very good are processing the image captured and then saving it ont he Data storage ( Internal storage or External storage ) . The sensor is of 16.2 mega pixel DX format CMOS sensor. Advantage of Nikon D5100 over Canon EOS 600D or for that matter even other brands ( Sony alpha DSLRs ) are as below : a ) 11 Point Auto focus system over Canon's 9 Point. b ) Lighter in weight than that of Canon EOS 600D c ) Slightly Cheaper in price compared to Canon. d ) Greater Color depth 23.5 bits as compared to Canon EOS 600D e ) Wide Dynamic range 13.0 EV f ) Images are sharper and less / low noise at high ISO Sensitivity while capturing snaps. g ) The NIKON D5100 has in camera HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) where as the Canon EOS 600D does not have HDR in built. h ) Nikon D5100 has larger Sensor @ 23.6mm x 15.6 mm Vs. 22.3mm x 14.9mm of that of Canon. ( Hence more light enters into the sensor and better image capturing experience ) i ) The Shutter lag is less than that of Canon EOS 600D. ( 273 mili seconds Vs. 283 mili seconds ) j ) The Nikon D5100 shoots at a faster rate of 4fps ( frames per second ) that than of Canon at 3.7 fps. k ) Has additional Special Effects option on the Mode dial with around 5 - 7 special effects for better and innovative image capture. l ) One specific observation I have noticed is that at low ISO settings , the D5100 is equal with the best of the competition Canon EOS 600d , Nikon D3100 , but at the higher ISO settings , it produces some of the best image quality that on would have ever seen from an APS - C sensor camera. m ) The it lens provided with this product ( Nikon D5100 ) is good for getting you started with DSLR. A good all purpose lens at a cheaper price but is worth using for your start - up into DSLR photography. n ) The lens is of focal length 18mm - 55 mm G type lens. it is quite good at capturing your subject's image at a wider range. o ) Both Nikon and Canon have a good repository of lenses to choose from. p ) The kit lens of Nikon is quite good , but I would only suggest to go for additional lens once you have got a good hang of DSLRs . One all purpose zoom lens ( Tamron or Sigma ), one Prime lens of 50 MM f1.8 aperture fixed focal length for outdoors is a must have in your lens collection. q ) I observed that the Battery life of Nikon D5100 is pretty good at capturing even the high resolution images. So at a Medium size image capture the number of images would increase and save battery life. r ) The LCD Menu is easy to understand and with the help button in hand on the rear body of the camera it serves as a good tutorial as well. s ) The Live view on the Tilting LCD screen is great to have. But the only problem here is that it takes quite a split of a second to focus on the subject. t ) Image quality is definitely the D5100's trump card. It offers effectively the same image quality as the higher - end D7000 , at a lower cost , and it's hard to argue that this is not a good thing. The final word from my side is : The Nikon D5100 is without doubt one of the most compelling and competitive products in its class compared to Canon and Sony , and offers an excellent mixture of straightforward handling , a well - targeted feature set , and excellent video and still image quality. As we'd expect from a camera with such a solid lineage , the D5100 is responsive and reliable in operation , and produces excellent images with a minimum of fuss. Overall , I am very satisfied with the product bought and would definitely recommend the Nikon D5100 DSLR to someone for his / her first choice as a beginner DSLR camera. - Cheers!!

I am very satisfied with my Nikon D5100 + 35mm f / 1.8 , would recommend both wholeheartedly to anybody considering a DSLR. My review is to help others buying their first DSLR make a decision. Firstly , all DSLRs take excellent photos and videos too. I believe that no one brand is MUCH better than the others 1. Budget : Whatever your budget , buy at least one good lens to suit your needs. Don't spend your full budget on a DSLR + kit lens *UNLESS* the kit lens is really enough. Good lenses help take good photos. If your budget is around 35k , consider a camera for under 30k with kit + at least one more lens to suit your needs. 2. Lenses : What type of photography do you plan on doing? Indoors / outdoors , portraits / landscapes , kids / pets etc.? Your satisfaction with any DSLR depends heavily on your choice of lenses to match your needs. Research a little and find what focal length / aperture / zoom and PRICE suits your needs. 3. Camera control : Understand your needs. If you are new to photography in general or don’t want to fidget with settings but still want to take good photos , too many buttons may not be needed , or just get in the way and overwhelm you. A camera that takes good pictures in "Auto" may better suit you. Nikon is usually the best at doing everything well automatically. As you learn more , you can fine tune all of your Nikon DSLR's 'Auto' settings too! 4. Features : All cameras offer broadly the same features , but here is why in the entry to upper - entry segment , I believe Nikon DSLRs are the best -- feature wise : -- Intelligent Auto ISO : Set MIN ISO , MAX ISO *AND* MIN Shutter speed. Other DSLRs have a button to adjust ISO , but with this Nikon feature , you will rarely ever need to adjust ISO again! It's not found on the 600D , no idea about the 1200D. -- Customizable White Balance presets : All Nikon DSLRS allow you to customize every WB preset to your tastes including Auto. Plus one custom setting too! As far as I know , you will not find this on entry level DSLRs. -- Nine Custom picture styles in camera + 99 on SD card. You can also transfer these to a different Nikon DSLR , so your custom picture styles will be with you as long as you use Nikon DSLRs. -- Menu history tab. Nikon menus are simple anyway. But they also have a history tab. Your most recently changed setting are saved. Even if you changed one item in playback menu , one from shooting menu , one from touch up menu , the history tab stores them. You may never have to keep navigating the entire menu again after just a short while of using your Nikon DSLR. Neat! -- Easy live view / Movie mode : Nikon beats Canons here. Push one lever to lock the mirror up , Live view starts , press the movie record button. Movie recording begins. No need to turn the mode dial. -- Live view / Movie autofocus. The Nikon D3x00 / D5x00 and above will do this. Not all other brands of entry / upper entry DSLRs offer movie autofocus. It's not super - fast , but it's better than manual focus! -- In - camera RAW to JPEG. Some competing entry level DSLRs lack this feature. All Nikon DSLRs have it. All DSLRs should have this. Non - pro buyers at this price point are unlikely to want to process their RAW files on their PC / Laptop , especially if they only occasionally need to adjustment white balance / color tone. -- Reliable exposure metering : Nikons are generally believed to have reliable exposure metering , with / without flash. Other entry / upper entry DSLRs are generally a small step down , my research suggests. You may still have to apply exposure compensation but you won't find yourself needing to change it often or have your subject under / over exposed when you least expected it on a Nikon. Overall , Nikons entry / upper entry DSLRs are better suited to users who want to take great photos , with minimum fuss , and don't want to spend a lot of time changing settings or post processing images. Nikons are generally perceived to be more reliable and rugged , and built to last. Also , Nikon make great lenses at many price points and you get lots of accessories for them , so it's not a brand you will ever have to worry about starting out with. One last point. D3xx / D5xx , it can get confusing. Here is my advice : - 24 vs 16 MP : You will benefit from 24 MP if ( a ) you have good lenses that can resolve 24 MP OR you shoot with apertures 5.6 or smaller for max sharpness , ( b ) you shoot at low ISOs , never over ISO 800 , and ( c ) you need to take small crops or make big enlargements often. Otherwise , the only difference between 24 vs 16 MP are larger file sizes. - Swiveling screen. The D5xxx range has it , D3xxx doesn’t. It’s a great feature and worth having. - Overall price / performance / VFM / image quality : In my opinion , the D5100 is the clear winner here , compared to other Nikon DSLRs and other brands too , in the 30k segment. Happy shooting :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 9 of 9 users found this review helpful.

Eagerly waiting for this camera to arrive before I leave for the holiday. But now it seems I will have to go on my holiday without this camera. I would advise everyone to think twice before making advance payment. COD would be better. Update on 10th Dec Even after repeated reminders & requests to the Callous Flipkart Customer care & Customer Support the Camera has not yet been delivered to me. Nobody in Flipkart has any clue what - so - ever about its current status. Everyone is giving vague replies & empty assurances after conveniently pocketing my hard earned Rs 28920. I have to leave now for the holiday without the camera. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 17 of 19 users found this review helpful.

One more thing , don't look for the Megapixels. This is just a technical term unless there is a difference like 8 Megapixels and 24 Megapixels. Don't forget , you still like that digital picture taken by a mobile VGA camera in resolution of 128X160 pixels. As I can see in some reviews , problems about registering the product.

Hi , I upgraded my camera from Fuji Fine Pix 2000 HD to DSLR after doing lot of research , I was about to take the Nikon D3100 as I can not afford the D7000 but this camera is you can say having most quality that D7000 is offering. I am happy to buy this & Having no complained till date. But for new user I would say take this machine only when you have the passion of the camera as it requires lot of care. For complete utilization of this camera , you will have to take one 70 mm to 300 mm lense as 17 - 55 mm lense is not sufficient enough.

Coming to the lens , its a decent lens with a good focal range i.e 70 - 300 mm. It doesn't have an APO. I personally feel the APO doesn't really matter ( in case you dont know what an APO does , it is just a more silent motor ) .

I had been tracking the order as I was really excited about getting my hands on the big boy. They were really quick and I got my package just in time. Coming to the lens , its a decent lens with a good focal range i.e 70 - 300 mm. It doesn't have an APO. I personally feel the APO doesn't really matter ( in case you dont know what an APO does , it is just a more silent motor ) . Well , coming to the motor , it is a little noisy if you have gotten used to the Nikkor lenses or the stock lens 18 - 55mm which comes along with the body. It doesn't have image stabilization. So I probably would suggest you carry a good tripod with you ( Well I got a DF - 41 Velbon tripod with the lens , have to say it's impressive ) . It has a Macro between 200mm to 300mm. So that's a feather on the cap. It comes in real handy. Many would be in a dilemma whether to go for the sigma or tamron. I would say the image quality of both the lenses are almost the same. But the huge difference between them is the fact that the sigma has a metal mounting whereas the tamron has a fiber one. That might be a little bit of a problem for the fact that you cannot switch between lenses very often in a rough manner. You have to be a little more extra careful with the fiber mounting which the Tamron has! So , I'd say this is a really good product if you are a beginner. If you can shell out more money , I'd obviously suggest you to go for the Nikkor 55 - 300 mm. Thanks for seeing the review!

Don't judge this lens on the 1st or 2nd day you get this.

Of course you can not compare this with Nikon or Cannon lenses , but for this budget its good lens. There are a few of cons. The Sharpness is not up to the mark in between 200 - 300mm.

Its not suitable for low lights ( tend to pickup lot of grains ) . Auto focus is slow and too noisy ( trust me its very noisy ) . Chromatic Abrasion. No VR , so hard to get handheld shots for long exposures ( Using a tripod would do the job ) . But I think for a beginner , these cons would in a way be helpful. Practice a lot and experiment different settings and exposures to get good snaps. If you manage to get good Pictures using this lens in spite of these cons , I am sure you'll do a lot better with good lenses ahead. This would be the main reason why I would suggest anyone to buy , if they are really ready to experiment. If you want a lens that performs well without much of your ideas and effort , then definitely this not a lens for you. Advantages : Low Cost , Metal Mount , Macro ( very good ), Good Zoom Range.

Buyer should request for the original purchase bill to enable them avail Canon warranty. 5 ) For a price under 10 k , this lens ( Mk I or II ) is a great buy.

Also the last "within budget" lens ... the 50mm 1.8 is also recommented. These 3 are more than sufficient for all the photos you will most likely take. Add to that cheap ( non automatic ) extention tubes and screw up lens from delhi and you have just about everything. so long and happy clicking!!

The lense is pretty fast when compared with the other lenses of its range. The IS makes every single penny worth for this product. The autofocus is very quick and extermly accurate. The lense dosent comes with a USM ( as its in the economy range ), however , I have used this lense to shoot wild life and considerably , it did a wonderful job without disturbing / grabbing much attention from the wild life. I would recommend this product for the entry lrvrl DSLR users. Cheers , Happy Shooting :) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

I have a Nikon D5000. This 35mm prime lens has replaced the 18 - 55mm kit lens as the default lens. Now , I use only this 35mm prime lens for everything. Pictures from this lens are sharp , colourful and very lively. The bokeh effect is also satisfactory. I like this lens a lot for it's ability to get great quality pictures in low light. This is especially evident when shooting indoors. Many a times , with the 18 - 55mm kit lens , I have had real difficulties shooting indoors. Flash spoils the naturalness of the photo and without it , the shutter speed needs to be so slow that unless you have a tripod , you won't capture good photos. But the 35mm prime lens works wonders in these situations. It gathers more light and allows you to shoot at higher shutter speeds. This means better , blur - free photos.. Don't even think twice about this lens. It is an absolute must have. Once you get this , you might find all your other lenses redundant. :-) Some people might be confused with 35mm vs 50mm prime lens. If you have a 18 - 55mm kit lens , set the focal lengths to both 35 and 50mm and then see how much area is covered. You'll get to know the difference. The 50mm will have a more zoomed in view as compared to 35mm. For outdoor shots , this won't make a difference. For indoor photography , this makes a lot of difference as you may not have too much space to step quite far away from the subject ( s ) to frame the photo correctly. I find that 35mm is perfect for both indoor and outdoor photography. If your camera has an inbuilt auto - focus motor ( D90 / D7000 and above ), then you better go for the other 50mm lens ( Nikkor AF 50mm f / 1.8D lens ) which costs about Rs.6100. That model does not have auto - focus motor built into the lens , but since your camera has it , you will save quite a bit of money.. For cameras like D40 / D3000 / D3100 / D5000 / D5100 which do not have built in auto focus motor in the camera , this particular lens ( Nikkor AF - S DX 35mm f / 1.8G lens ) is the best. This lens will truly make you a better photographer. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 92 of 92 users found this review helpful.

My appreciations to all who wrote about this lens here and elsewhere. My background. I started clicking in 1973 with Agfa Click III. Had used many - Olympus OM 40 P with Olympus Zuiko 55mm f1.2. & 85mm f2 lenses. Zenith with Helios lenses , etc. Now using Nikon D3200. Nikon AF - S DX NIKKOR 35mm f / 1.8G Lens This is a fixed focal length ( not a zoom lens ) with a super silent AF motor built inside the lens. Its filter thread size is 52mm. The lens lacks an aperture ring. But the following aperture settings are possible on the Aperture Priority mode from the camera body 22 , 20 , 18 , 16 , 14 , 13 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7.1 , 6.3 , 5.6 , 5 , 4.5 , 4 , 3.5 , 3.2 , 2.8 , 2.5 , 2.2 , 2 and1.8. It has a focus ring and you can manually fine adjust the focus if you desire so. Fine focusing is fantastic. But the focus ring is narrow and appears inconvenient to me. The package comes with a black plastic lens hood and a lens pouch. It also has a manual & warranty card. Nikon had packed the lens inside the carton such that the lens stays 2 cms above the bottom of the pack ; 1.5 cms inside from the sides of the pack and more than 6 cms deep from the top of the pack – exemplary packing. No fear of reasonable impact damage from top bottom or sides. The Nikon carton is factory sealed. It comes with a 2 year service warranty. Flipkart ( WS Retail ) had used an air bubble packing to safely pack the Nikon carton. So no possibility of damage due to reasonable impacts during handling and transit. 35 mm DX is equivalent to 52.5 mm lens in DX format D 3200 body The Nikon 50 mm f 1.8 D , which is around Rs 6000 /-, is also cheaper , sharper and crisper , but will not auto focus in D 3200 body , since D 3200 body doesn’t have an auto focus motor incorporated into it. The Nikon 50 mm f 1.8 G will auto focus and is almost the similar price of this lens. But 50 mm lens in a DX body is not standard ; it is equivalent to 75 mm lens ( or 80 mm lens ) and becomes a portrait lens. This lens is a G lens where as the 50 mm f 1.8 D costing Rs 6000 is a D lens. The G lens produces images with beautiful backdrops and splendid bokehs than D lens. Of course G is costlier than D. One drawback is , this lens lacks VR ( vibration reduction ) wrt 18 - 105mm lens ; so you need a tripod or at least a monopod for very low light situations. Since it is equivalent to 52.5 mm lens ( 35 x 1.5 = 52.5 ) it is a standard lens ; and presence of VR would have been an added advantage for handheld photography in low light situations. Another positive side of the same coin is absence of VR makes the lens rugged inside its housing. I feel that a wide lens that DOESN'T need VR would be 23.33mm ( 35 ÷ 1.5 = 23.33 ) or wider ones. But it is Nikon R&D team to think about this. When compared with Nikon 18 - 105 lens , this Nikon 35 mm f 1.8 G is producing brighter , sharper , crisper and colourful images and definitely superior to kit lens at 35 mm in bokeh effect. For night shots and low light shots without flash this is superb lens w.r.t. ( w.r.t. = with respect to ) to kit lens. It produces splendid images in low ambient ( natural ) light. I prefer ambient light to flash since it produces natural images. At ISO 6400 and Hi1 settings , this lens renders night shots with stunning image quality. At f 5.6 and smaller apertures , this 35 mm Nikkor glass gives exemplary sharpness at this price As the lens gets wider , naturally light enters the camera from a wider area , and the image gets brighter w.r.t. tele lens. More light falling on the sensor translates into a faster shutter speed and blur free pictures. More light on a more Megapixel ( 24 MP ) sensor further translates into stunning image quality and better cropping possibility. My other choice was a Nikon AF - S DX Micro NIKKOR 40mm f / 2.8G Lens. Reviews say that you have to get more close to the subject which is a disadvantage for general purpose photography. Mover over I can buy a 52 mm close up lens filter or reverse lens adapter and get the same purpose done. But if get a lot of spare money I will definitely buy this lens because I love close up shots. But , not for now. Above all this 35 mm lens is lighter in weight. My purpose is general photography , family shots , outdoor vacation photography and indoor shots like meeting , family function , etc without flash. So I opted for 35 mm f 1.8 G as the prime standard lens for my DX format camera. It also has an angle of vision almost near to the older 50 mm lens of Film SLR camera ( same for FX format DSLR ) which I am used to , since 1980's. This lens is MADE IN CHINA & imported by Nikon India Pvt Ltd in Aug 2013. Flipkart ( WS Retail ) was perfect in receiving , processing and dispatching this order. Blue Dart handled this shipment with professional standards. Cost Rs.12440.

With this at 1600ISO setting , nights are photographable with a quality you never thought possible. 50mm f1.8 is similarly good but meant for Full frame Nikon. Angle of view of 50mm f1.8 with D3100 ( APS - C format ) is lower and thus does not cover many type of photo. As I said in the title this will spoil you and you will find every other lens are not sharp enough , too heavy and too costly for their image quality.

If indoors you should get the 35 , but if outdoors get the 50. This has to do with the distance you would need for framing your subjects. This is my opinion , frankly , but whichever of these two prime lenses you buy , you cannot go wrong. They are both great and at their current price , no reason at all not to own at least one of them! Why buy a fast prime lens? Firstly , low light photography. But also professional looking out of focus backgrounds and subject isolation -- the 50 mm has better quality of background rendering ( bokeh ), but the differences are subtle and won't get in the way of great photos. Only con is , yes , there is some color fringing if you have strong highlights which are just in front or behind the subject ( otherwise this is not visible ) -- this is normal with all but the very highest quality lenses which would then cost many - many times more , so just frame carefully whenever you shoot in harsh ( like mid day ) lighting. This is the only time you will notice these since all other forms of color fringing is automatically removed by all current Nikon DSLRs automatically ( other brand DSLRs don't remove this ) . Two tips : If you have to focus manually , switch to live view and zoom in , half press the shutter and then fine - tune the focusing manually ( remember you DON'T have to switch the lens to manual focus for this ) . It's very easy. Second , remember to turn ON lens correction in the camera settings , it is turned OFF by default!

However there are times when I go out only with my DX camera for general photography and the 50mm becomes limiting as it is not wide enough.

I had mentioned all the reasoning dropped mails , made calls , researched about the error on canons website and got to know that the error is because of some mechanical malfunction... buy now It was really an worst experience shopping online just to save a few bucks... anyways i had to do everything on my part so i decided to visit the canon service center ..they said it was a firmware issue updated the same returned me back my canon camera ...at the end i feel no one is there to be blamed for the product as it was sealed packed but my experience shopping with flipkart was horrible the seller kharidiye and also Flip kart lacks in timely communication after the sale has been made..When there has been a replacement and complaint launched there has to be a prompt and effective response as a customer we can at least expect this..they said we will resolve the case either replace the product or give me my money back it was suppose to happen in 48 hours ..10 days have passed by i did all the running that was required but still flipkart and kharidiye are yet to reply..hope this review is read analyzed and acted upon so that hence forth your clients are satisfied and they return to give you more business..

After 2 or 3 days issue started occurring repeatedly and one of my friend checked this and told there is something wrong with this camera. Raised the issue to Flipkart , Flipkart initiated the return procedure. Seller rejected the return with message "Manufacturer warranty product , go to the service center please". I reached the service center by 9th of December and asked for replacement as it is defective from the day it is taken out from the box. Service center person told replacement can be claimed only within 7 days from the date of invoice , my invoice date is on 29th November and i received the product only on 4th December. So i have to be there by 6th to claim replacement but since i am not aware of this i went bit late ( Dec 9th , after the weekend ) . Finally they checked the camera body and lens and told it is problem with one of the lens and they repaired the lens part. Now i am not getting those issues , but do note that ( for Canon ) you have to go to service center within a week to get the replacement done.

Bought this camera only to discover that the seal was tampered with and there was an attempt to seal it again with a secondary seal. Didn't open it and returned to flipkart. They shipped another camera. With the same problem. Exactly the same problem. The seal was broken again. Don't trust Flipkart with their vendor selection , they're taking customers for granted.

It is more suitable for beginners / amateurs in d - slr photography. learning everything else about it in other professional reviews. Second , regarding product warranty - Cambay has also sent invoice with supplier seal , along with the warranty card. Warranty card does not carry any seal , but having checked with canon shop , they clarified that it is ok if you have invoice with seal. It may also be good to check with canon support to let them register ( donno if it works out , but trying ) . I have also verified that , exif info available as part of every image captured by this camera shows same serial number as in camera body - just to avoid hidden surprises! UPDATE : I just got my cam and lens kits registered in canonedge. It seems like , we do lil extra work here ( online purchase ) . First , in canonedge , create your login. While you validate your kit serial number ( s ), it would fail. Then I had shoot out mail to their customer support as well as canonedge admin ( check their FAQ ) . They assured it would be done quickly , but waited for 3 days. Then finally , the moment I escalated using their portal support , things got in place - This package s fully registered for two yrs warranty - no worries! ... :) Third , regarding freebie - no issue with SD card. reg bag , it can accommodate only the body and one lens at a time , though you can freeze both lens with some squeezing , but not recommending for long time ( buy a d - slr modular carry / back bag for that! ) . But not bad in terms of its padding foam and material quality ( inner as well as outer ) . Other stuffs that come along with it as they say ( battery charger , cables ) - and not finding any problem with them. Appreciating FK for consistently maintaining quick and safe delivery.

This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer , Blink Proof alerting and Red - Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p. It takes very sharp images in daylight and indoors. One of the cons of this camera is that low light photography is a bit blurry but still decent. A 4GB SDHC card is provided along with the camera.

No in between pausing of video recording possible. So each time you have to stop and so new file will get created. 12. Has a wifi kind of icon displayed on screen. But has no wifi connectivity.

This 50mm is ideal for what is called "street photography" , and fine for portraiture if you have the real estate to jockey for position.

The lack of zooming in and out does not annoy me at all for the fact that the focal length if 50 mm is extremely practical in many situations. If I've to say anything bad about this lens at all , that would be the build quality. But then it's not too bad either , and what is to be expected at this price? Clearly , this is a winner!

Probably not a genuine Canon India product. I got this lens 9 days back , the lens is nice because it gives you accessibility for low light photography , shallow depth of field. The quality is not as plasticky as most reviews on the net claim. However the 2 year warranty clause is that if you register it on the Canon Edge website you get an additional 1 year of warranty to the basic 1 year one. When I tried to register it on the website , it did not accept my product to be a genuine Canon India network product.

Let me rate its good points in comparison to my 18 - 135 : 1. Lightning fast autofocus. Slightly faster than 18 - 135 kit lens. 2. Very light weight , much lighter than my 18 - 135 , almost half the weight. 3. Smaller sized than 18 - 135. Almost half of it. 4. Image resolution is better than 18 - 135's for most focal lengths. I took some pics and they came out very detailed. I was mind - blown by the details. Of course , with aperture going wide open like f / 1.8 , there was little lesser detail , but it was still good enough to blow kit lens out of water. 5. For a 50mm prime , this lens' bokeh is amazing. Of course , the 18 - 135mm lens if set to 135mm gives better bokeh... but this lens does so at 50mm , courtesy large aperture. 6. Cost is unexplainably low. With such good quality , this lens will match some of its more expensive lenses in performance , but the price is low. Its Value for money. I got it for Rs. 6799. 7. It sucks light like a light hole. Even in pitch dark , this lens managed to capture faces at 1.3 seconds shutter speed. Even till mid evening , I could manage to click at 1 / 100th of a second with no direct light on the subject. 8. Effective design to protect against its elements. The outer lens glass can't be scratched easily because its way inside , so in a way , this will make sure not all things touch your front glass. Even without a UV filter installed. 9. Support for full frame cameras , so later when you get a FF , you won't need to sell this lens. On the flip side , the 18 - 135mm lens I already have will give a dark circle in the image , when mounted on a Full Frame. Bad points are : 1. No Image stabiliser. This results in higher required shutter speeds. With 18 - 135 I could snap pics without motion blur , at 1 / 60th of a second , and sometimes even 1 / 15th of a second with good luck and hold. This lens needs atleast 1 / 80 because it does not have Optical IS and images may come out shaky , unless you use a tripod. But then , its quite economical so I didn't expect to have it either. Plus , its wide open aperture handles low light very well. Think about it , 18 - 135 has maximum aperture of f / 3.5 that too at 18mm only.... This lens has f / 1.8 which is amazing. 2. On the internet , people say its Plasticky but it doesn't affect me. I'm amazed by the quality and I don't care about its material. So , that sums it up. Once you get this lens , you will notice an instant boost in sharpness and resolution. So much that even if you print A4 photos , you will notice this lens being faster. For those new to photography , let me tell you , compared to 18 - 135mm ( 7.5x zoom ) lens , the 50mm means you can't zoom in and out , such lenses are called "Prime lenses". But this inability to zoom gives them a bigger power :- Constantly high Image Quality. That's why they say : Prime lenses make a photographer. FK : Flipkart's associated retailer ( WS Retail ) packed it very well. Alongwith outer box , there was bubble wrap thicker than the inside box itself.... The lens couldn't have been damaged even if you drop it from Petronas Twin Towers. Very good packaging. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 2 of 2 users found this review helpful.

Three types of Focus available : Near , Normal , Infinity Three types of powerful flash : Auto , On , Slow Sync Digital Zoom is great but hard to take a stable shot with full zoom on. Video Recording is awesome , HD videos at 25fps , downside : If ur using the cam in low light indoors & flash if off , it will produce noise or darker images. Try switching to Auto with flash on or to low light mode with Flash on , and it will do the trick. All in all great Cam for starters an light occasional picture taking in a very low price.

When I persisted for the "best option" I had after the order had been delayed , I was told to cancel the order or re - initiate. I re - initiated the order and I have to wait for 4 more days now. I am giving a 1 start rating to the seller / courier company / Flipkart. Once I actually receive the product , I will write a review of the product and may be revise my rating about FK and product. === Edited / addendum === ( + ) - the camera is quite sleek - image quality is very good. - flash output is good for close range shots. - image noise is well controlled. - battery seems to be ok. Haven't tested it by running to 0 charge. (-) - battery + battery compartment can give you troubles , beware. the battery goes into the compartment either ways , but you will be able to close the battery cover flap only on the correct alignment. - the battery cover flap is quite delicate. - flash range is less for a large group photo in low light. i was scared i will break it I will rate the camera 4 ( 1 star less for the battery compartment and battery cover flap ) rating for seller / deliver still remains 1 star!

Used this camera for 15 days. Image quality is not good , there will be noise in the images and in low light , image quality will become worse. In a single line i want to conclude that if u have used SLR or some other good quality camera then u will remain unsatisfied with the image quality but if u r using this camera as a suppliment thing for occasional use then u may find dis product useful.

Pathetic camera! you get what you pay for On time delivery and good packaging from flipkart. Too bad images in dark ( i tried almost all the available settings still no use :( ) Even in good sunlilght images are almost the quality you get on cheap cellphones. Terrible , terrible waste of money , now I have to find something good. I have used Canon powershot A470 in past and it was way better than this Ixus 145.

The manual focus is good as well. The clarity of the image is maintained even at higher ISO with least noise , the Exmor R sensor gives fine quality image even at low light conditions , far better than any other camera in its class. And the image stabilization is really very effective which works fine even at the telephoto end of the lens without any compromise on the image. The wide apperture and Carl Zeiss lenses , along with the wifi photo imports and ability of installing apps , and the 4K image quality makes it out standing and far better than its competitors. Over all , if you can afford this camera , just go for it. No matter if you're a professional or amateur photographer. You will definitely not regret it. I believe its better and cheaper ( with its out standing features ) than buying starting DSLRs and their lenses. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

Best Camera for starters Super zoom and Pixel combination. Easy to use and covers all aspects of photography. Exmor CMOS sensor is the best for the class. Just some negligible errors in the display that do not affect the image quality or user experience at all. Also , using zoom upto 100x gives stable images due to the Optical SteadyShot.

Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

This lens does it all , nicely , and without much fuss , I use it with Nikon D800 Pros : Multicoated Lens elements Lightweight compared to the range it covers with quality VR works great with an more efficient 'Active' mode Zoom range extends upto 300mm with f / 5.6 aperture at the 300mm end with VR gives usable good quality handheld shots Good value lens for Nikon FX users and all other low end Nikon bodies will get equivalent focal length of Appx. 105 - 450mm f / 4.5 - 5.6 VR Cons : It is not a MACRO lens , and hence does not give 'Close distance focusing' Focus haunts at low light or at distant objects at 300mm Plastic body construction ( Made in Thailand ) small filter size ( 67 ) No Tripod - collar available or attached Wont work good with Tele - convertors if used with lower bodies The front element extend to double size while zooming full Huge zoom range sucks in lot of dust No weather sealings No aperture - ring Don't worry folks , buy one if you need , and you'll be happy.

The VR makes it possible to shoot ( if there is enough light ) without a tripod , which makes it possible to catch unexpected bird sightings. Autofocus is fast and great ( in daylight ) and the zoom range of 70 - 300mm is great for perched birds , small animals , and pets and children playing. I also use it hand held for portraits in large gatherings , shooting from distance means natural pictures , and the bokeh is good. With higher ISOs I have also taken okay shots after dark , without a trip… I mainly bought it for shooting birds , and am more than satisfied with the results.

Excellent Product I'm really satisfied with this lens in terms of sharpness , color rendering and auto focus speed. I was in hurry so I booked it under single day delivery and it was delivered as promised with proper packing. Price of this lens is also very competitive. I am using Nikon D5300 so effective focal length is 105 - 450 mm which is very good for normal sports and wild life photography.

Professional Lens on a budget Got this for my year old D3200 and boy was i glad to buy this!! Prior to this I had the stock 18 - 55 and the 50mm 1.8D. The 1.8D was for awesome for the clarity but the stock 18 - 55 lacked the crispness of the pictures. Decided to purchase this after some looking around to replace the stock 18 - 55. The lens produces some very crisp images with decent lightning. Recommended :) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

Great High Zoom Lens This is a great lens to buy for beginners and you would never feel that you are far away from an object. The picture quality is great across the board whether you are at x70 or x300. Autofocus is really quick. The build quality is solid , doesn't feel like a cheap plastic.

There is another 70 - 300 non - VR , but don't have the VR and that won't work with bodies like D5100 , D5200 etc.. you need to have a motor in the Body. Which means D90 or higher can take that lens. Its much cheap ( 6K rupees approx. against 30K for the VR version ) . Overall , wonderful lens if you can afford , it will be worth every bit of it.

In addition to all this , it also carries my 17 inch Toshiba laptop with its charger and data card , spare batteries , memory cards , user manuals , my tripod and other sundry stuff. The quality of the material is excellent and the bag is extremely sturdy and comfortable. I accidentally dropped it once from a height of 8 feet with all my stuff inside. There wasn't even a single scratch on either my stuff or the bag itself. I would highly recommend the product. If you love your SLR , look no further , give it the bag it deserves.

It comes with a rain proof cover as well , which is GREAT when it rains! Overall this is a great product and I'd definitely recommend buying it. Flipkart delivered it within 2 days of ordering!! Amazing service!! I'd strongly recommend a buy on this one! Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful.

But having use of trekking only. Difficult to carry on daily usage needs , Otherwise , built quality is excellent. Enough space to accommodate maximum of your gear all together in bag . It is ideal for outdoor and travel photography. I am very happy to have it. Prior to this , I was using Lowepro Pro Runner 200 AW Backpack , but as needs and priorities changed all together time to time , I found LPR 350 AW was a wise choice.

Happy that the product hasn't disappointed me .Enough space for my present gear consisting of one body and three lenses and a flash plus more to accommodate one more 100 - 400 zoom that I plan to buy in the future. Build is top quality and the bag , especially the straps are thickly padded to make carrying it around least burdensome. And there's plenty of space to keep my memory cards , battery charger , spare flash batteries and manuals. The laptop space can store an iPad comfortably. The best thing is the attached rainproof cover which is discreetly stored in its own pouch within the backpack which can hold a book / maps too.All in all , a class product - value for money.Only fear is that the zippers may get damaged as they usually do. Hope not with this backpack. What impressed me about the whole purchase was that I placed my order at 11.16 am on the 5th and the item was delivered on the 6th at 6.30 pm.I was stumped at the standard delivery time. I'd checked with other sellers before ordering here on Flipkart , where it was priced about Rs 500 less. Good deal from WS.

Amazing Bag I bought this bag after a lot of deliberation between Vanguard and Lowepro. I am glad I stuck to this one. Its amazingly sturday. I manage to fit in my Canon DSLR , 100 mm lens , 18 - 55 , 60mm , 50mm lens and spare batteries , 14" inch laptop and a loads of other accessories. The bag straps are extremely sturdy and ensure that the weight is evenly distributed , thus carrying it a becomes a very easy exercise even on long hikes. Once again , flipkart was extremely prompt in delivery Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse</DIV></DIV>

Be sure know what this lens can and can't do When we think of a telephoto lens , we think its for wildlife , birding or to catching anything that is hard to access from close. I got this lens for wildlife and I am unhappy as there is huge distortion when you click image. Its impossible to get a steady pic of any animal moving ( bird in action is a remote possibilty ) as there is no Image Stabilization in this cam. If you are looking for landscape , then probably this lens might help ( i dont like to believe so ) . My recommendation is avoid this lens and go for a higher version with Image Stabilizer.

Good for people who desperately want a telephoto lens after being exhausted with the kit lens ( 18 - 55 ) lens I recently bought this lens from Flipkart. I had left home early on the day it was to be delivered so it couldn't be delivered on the first day. I arranged for a next day delivery by calling Flipkart , which they did without any problem. Great service by Flipkart! This lens is good if you want to try shooting subjects at a distance , which you couldn't do earlier with the 50mm or the 18 - 55mm kit lens. So , if someone desperately wants a telephoto zoom lens after getting bored with the kit lens but really doesn't want to burn a hole in his pocket , this is the one to go for! Pros… I recently bought this lens from Flipkart. I had left home early on the day it was to be delivered so it couldn't be delivered on the first day.

This lens is good if you want to try shooting subjects at a distance , which you couldn't do earlier with the 50mm or the 18 - 55mm kit lens. So , if someone desperately wants a telephoto zoom lens after getting bored with the kit lens but really doesn't want to burn a hole in his pocket , this is the one to go for! Pros - 1 ) Good built , feels good to the touch and heavy ( a little less than 0.5 kg ) 2 ) Long focus ring 3 ) You get sharp pictures if shot somewhere between 70mm to 135mm and in good light 4 ) Allows you to click macro pictures between 200mm to 300mm 5 ) Comes with a lens hood. 6 ) The lens cap can be used to cover the lens even if the lens hood is fitted onto the lens. It saves you the pain of taking off the hood to put the lens cap in place. Cons - 1 ) Auto - focus is noisy and it takes longer time to focus especially in poor lighting conditions 2 ) No Image stabilisation. You'll need a tripod otherwise you'll get blurry images , unless you want to click each and every picture holding your breath or you trust your hands to be super steady. 3 ) Poor color reproduction ( Images look dull ) 4 ) Chromatic aberration seen between 150mm to 300mm. 5 ) Pictures come out soft and a bit "noisy" at 300mm 6 ) Lens hood that comes with it isn't of the same material but is made of plastic. It could break if you accidently dropped it. 7 ) Macro feature isn't that good. You can't expect sharp pictures using this feauture as compared to specialised lens for this purpose. At a price less than 10K , I'm sure you'll agree you can't expect it to do something great. You could go for the Canon 55 - 250mm ( IS ) for better results but at almost double the price! It's still a must have for someone who just wants to start wildlife photography but doesn't want to spend much! ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 4 of 4 users found this review helpful.

I am no pro nor i want to become the next Ansel Adams but i can tell you one thing if you want a good telephoto lens around 7K without emptying your pockets this is the best buy. i mostly been using this in broad day light and it's been giving me satisfying results. no Optical Image stabilisation can sometimes be an issue but still it does the job perfectly. but in lowlight conditions it may many time's underperform but still Pro's triumph the Con's at this price range. plus flipkarts provides amazing service delivered to me in two working days and at Rs.6999 it's been an amazing buy.

Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

We are living in a time where actually difference between cameras is just feel and not quality and other things. All the cameras out there can produce brilliant images , if you know how to use them. Don't believe me? Go to Flikr , open camera finder and look at the stunning pictures taken from canon / nikon / pantex / olympus and even iPhone 4s / galaxy S3s and Nokia's. Don't be fooled when someone says "this camera can take good pictures" , coz its the person behind the camera who takes the picture. Camera just prints it on the sensor or film. Now about the camera , 600D. It takes nice pictures. It has all the features a beginner should need , and then some when you grow as a photographer and add some thingamajigs it will let you. Picture quality is very good , if you have some good glasses then you can produce excellent images. Noise is there at high ISO , but which camera doesn't? Nikon is a bit better , but only when you see you images at 100% magnification , then only you can tell some difference. What to do? shoot in RAW and use software noise reduction ( In - camera noise reduction can loose some details ) I use Adobe lightroom 4.3 , which has very good noise reduction algorithms. **Always shoot in RAW**. Or you can use lower ISO with lower shutter speeds. Flipkart gives you a free tripod , right? 2nd thing about in camera focus motor. No , conon does not have it. Shocking? Actually all the EF line series of Canon cameras have internal focus motors , so why you need and in - body motor? canon dumped their entire lens lineup in 1987 , in favor of EF ( and EF - S ), where now in - body focus motor is not necessary. Nikons still have there pre - F mount..hmm.. bayonet mount ...err..whatever mount lens compatibility. Some of older lenses ( like 50mm f1.8 D ) which still require in - body focus motor , so they left it there. Now your choice...cheaper body and costly lenses , or slightly costly body and cheaper , but optically just as good , if not better ( actually some are better ), lenses. Nikon AF - S lenses are not costlier , actually many of the canon lenses are costlier. for example , canon EF 70 - 300 f4 - 5.6 USM IS lens is 46k on FK , canon is 35k something. Don't know which one is better though. I have used canon one , which is pretty good , not like L lens , but good. There are other way around examples as well. You see , you can debate your whole span of life which one is better , but people who take great pictures , go out in the field with whatever gear they have , and produce beautiful images. So choose whichever suits you , which feels good in your hand and start shooting. Make the best of the gear you have , even a Hasselblad or Leica is not perfect. Why I bought canon? 1.I had a budget , in which I felt this was the best model ( Sadly they reduces the price the 3rd day I bought it ) :(( 2. This one felt good in my hand , nikon was a little too small. 3. I have friends , who have canons , so I can borrow some lenses : D. This one can produce great images in good hands , and crap in bad. It doesn't do anything on its own. Happy snapping. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 91 of 95 users found this review helpful.

Great Product Image quality The 600D primarily with the kit 18 - 135mm lens but it also comes in a range of other kit configurations including a more standard 18 - 55mm. As the sensor and image processor of the 550D and 600D is identical , image quality is exactly the same. What this means to photographers who haven't experienced the 550D is excellent colour rendition and noise control at high ISO levels. Dynamic range is very good , though there can be some highlight clipping in contrasty situations when using automatic exposures. JPEG processing is very good through most ISO levels.

Dynamic range is very good , though there can be some highlight clipping in contrasty situations when using automatic exposures. JPEG processing is very good through most ISO levels. ISO 3200 and 6400 ( the highest of the native ISO range ) produce acceptable levels of noise for reduced or web resolution use. Colour noise at full magnification is quite pronounced though. Video quality Video quality , as with the 550D , is excellent. It's simply the best you can get on any SLR in this particular price bracket. Colour rendition is superb and the video image is smooth. Even the internal microphone seems to produce better audio than on the 550D. The 600D also gets manual audio levels ( though still no method to monitor the audio before recording apart from referring to the visual meter ) .

Brilliant Camera for Beginners It was a great challenge for me to select a camera which gives me a smooth accessibility over its awesome controls / settings. Like everyone else I was also confused between Canon 600d and Nikon 5100. I took almost one month to review both of them and then made my turn for Canon. Below are the reasons for which I went for 600D - 1. Previously I used Canon SX150IS which gave me a good amount of manual control with the limited feature of a compact camera.

Below are the reasons for which I went for 600D - 1. Previously I used Canon SX150IS which gave me a good amount of manual control with the limited feature of a compact camera. I believe that experience also forced me to go for 600D. 2. I also went to a shop to check their physical built and to be honest with you everyone should try this before buying a DSLR. Canon 600D felt very comfortable to hold in my hands. It is slightly bigger than 5100. This was also a driving factor. 3. Last but not the least was the Auto focus feature. Canon DSLR has this feature in their body ( entry to high end model ), where as Nikon provides it in lens for entry level models. Some more points you should consider before purchase - 1. Canon and Nikon has their own ecosystem for lenses. Third party lenses are also available for both. If you are thinking to take your photography to next level then you should study your options. As the kit lens will not do 100% justice to the camera sensor in terms of quality. 2. Please do not fall for Megapixel gimmick. As a beginner you would hardly take A4 prints of your photos. For that both of the cameras has good amount of MP. Just remember on APS - C sensor higher resolution could end up with nasty image noise. Both cameras are awesome and comparing them according to technical specification would do no justice. Each having some strength or weakness compared to other. But both of them can deliver mesmerizing images. So go for the one which makes you feel like it is an extension of your creative part. I choose Canon as I felt the same. Thank you Flipkart for awesome delivery. Packaging was very good. The camera was delivered within the next day of purchase.

Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Sam Geoffray Apr 12 , 2012 Excellent Camera for Beginners I wanted to buy this camera for a while now and I got it a month ago. I just love this camera. But if you compare this one with Nikon D5100 , Nikon may score better in terms of image quality and price. But 600D scores well in video quality. 18MP in 600D and 16.1MP in D5100 wont make a big difference. The wireless flash option which is in 600D is a handly feature , which is not there in D5100 and external wireless flash transmitter cost too much. I'm a Canon fan so i opted for Canon. So its individuals call to to opt for which one they want. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 15 of 18 users found this review helpful.

Image quality - excellent resolution 2. Image colors - a little dull ( ever so lightly though ) in default mode , but just tweak a notch up in custom picture settings , you'll be awed! 3. Burst speed - pretty good! I tried it with AI Servo focus mode on my 11 month old son always on the move , and the results are fantastic! 4. Image noise - yes , it's present at 1600 ISO , but why would you even shoot beyond 800 ISO in these mid - range DSLRs? 5. Build quality - Made in Taiwan , and feels pretty solid except for the SDCard and Battery doors. Would have been happier with a 'Made in Japan' , but it's ok , we're a third world country! 6. 18 - 55 kit lens - I wish Canon gave a lens as sharp as the ones that come with Sony SLTs. No comparison here , the SLTs' kit lens are way better. It might sound subjective , but you be the judge 7. Video quality and options - awesome at this price point What could have been better? ( note : these are not cons ) 1. Auto focus on live view ( contrast detect ) - pathetic , and I'm more convinced to use the optical viewfinder :) 2. Missing proximity sensor under the view - finder ( the 550D had this!! ) 3. Mode dials do not rotate 360 deg. My Canon S5IS rotates perpetually , which is good 4. Bundling an HDMI cable would have been a nice touch Note 1 : I didn't buy from Flipkart for 2 reasons. 1. Much lower price at a local store near my place. 2. Didn't want any of their freebies ( 'll buy them separately , later ) Note 2 : WARRANTY registration on Canon Edge. When I tried to register my camera , it said 'Serial number not found'. I panicked and even went to the lengths of thinking that it could be a smuggled product as I bought for cheap :( Then after digging around , wrote a mail to admin@canonedge.com with a screenshot of my invoice , and I was able to register the product after 24 hours. @Kunal Puri - this answers your question?

The 18 - 55 mm wide angle lens is a starter's lens which will help you click everything. From portraits to landscapes to even street photography. Though I do recommend getting a 50mm prime lens ( priced 7 , 000 right now ) along with this camera. Prime lenses deliver quality which can only be experienced. Anyways , the battery backup is awesome. One full day of clicking still leaves you with some battery to view the pics on your way back home. Video shooting is excellent. Auto focus is a pure charmer and with the right memory card you can shoot everything from TVCs to short films to documentaries and even feature films ( trust me , I have a Master's degree in journalism n mass communication ) . The camera comes with a BnW mode as well. The flash is more than capable of getting clear photographs in the dark. Although getting a lens hood is recommended. Now when I got this camera , I got a tripod stand which I fell in love with almost instantly. Family photographs , long exposure shots or simply standing in my room hooked to the tripod... the camera offers so much once paired with the tripod. The camera came with a bag , Canon camera strap , lens cleaner , two memory cards ( 4gb and 16gb , offers keep changing ) and a tripod stand. I have journeyed with this camera up in the hills and even in the plains. It is an awesome camera and I would more than recommend it.

The swivel LCD screen is exceptionally clear and does justice in terms of contrast of the taken picture , on transferring the pics I found that there was no or negligible difference in the contrast displayed. The fact that it can be turned in different directions enables for self portraits , event shooting over crowds etc. 3. the construction of the camera body is good , not excessively heavy and has a textured non slip kind of surface , I found that single hand shooting also felt pretty secure. 4. the in kit 18 - 55 lens is good for medium depth and macro photography though due to its minimum aperture , indoor photography and low light photography tends to look dull , daylight photography is beautiful. The ONLY concern that I have is in the joint of the swivel LCD screen , it turns a full 180 only in one direction and 90 in the opposite direction , if by chance excess force is applied twisting in the wrong direction the screen might snap , so except for a little caution when handling it there's no other issue as such. All in all its a worthy buy , definitely recommend it for beginners , amateurs and semi - professional photographers. Regarding the service : Flipkart did an amazing job of very securely packaging the camera and accessories bundle with lots of bubblewrap etc. I got the package within 36 hours.

Transfer to iPhone or iPad using built in WIFI is brilliant for uploading to social websites! U can also use the same to take pictures as a remote control. This is possible with the nikon app that you can download for all platforms including android and iOS. I particularly like this feature as it is amazing to use ur iPhone to see the images u want to take pictures of and click ur phone to shoot them remotely!!! This alone along with the others makes it a must buy for all gadget freaks! 39 point autofocus , swivel screen , various effects , carbon fibre body shell making it extra light. The list goes on and on! When it comes to taking pictures , it is brilliant. Beginners and amateurs can use it to point and shoot in auto mode and the pics r brilliant! Semi pros and professionals can play with the apertures and exposure rates and render mind blowing pics! Kit came with Nikkor AFS 18 - 55 lenses. Picked up a prime lens AFS Nikkor 35mm. This is enough for both landscapes ( 18mm for wide angle ) and portraits ( 35mm ) Pics r extremely sharp with the 35mm lenses! This kit can be expanded with telephoto lenses for advanced photographers. If you are looking for something to point and shoot but want pictures like the pros but also want something to pick up for future expansion to a professional level.. Just go for the D5300!!! Cons : Will post if I can find something.. Best of all , I got it for the lowest price in India , thanks to Flipkart!!! Amazing product , well packaged and delivered in two days flat! Splendid!!!!

Last time I saw , the price was around 47 , 000. So buy it the minute it touches the least price. Also , Kudos to Flipkart. The camera was delivered to me the very next day from the day I placed my order! ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 5 of 6 users found this review helpful.

Bad Experience My wife bought me d5300 two days ago from Flipkart. The seller was WS - Retail. I was so happy getting my first DSLR. Everything was fine in the package. The camera was good. All the accessories were good. Got a 8 GB class 10 mem - card. But when I put the battery into the charger the LED blinked for 2 - 3 minutes then turned off.

But its a kind request to them if they could change the battery charger or the battery ( I am confused between which one is actually faulty ) it will be good. I liked the camera very much so my wife bought it. But this bad experience on the start has made me feel bad. In fact I relied most of the time on WS - Retail because of their good service and good products ( even if some times other sellers are selling in a bit low price , I preferred WS - Retail ), but this is a first bitter experience in buying products from them.

Enough has been said about the camera elsewhere and professional reviews are available. I was worried about whether the item would get damaged in transit.

Here is a small list of pros and cons from my point of view : PROS : - Affordable - Light Weight - User Interface and controls are simple and easy. - Can produce stunning professional quality images. - Video quality is superb ( 720p HD ) CONS : - No Spot Metering. ( you can use partial metering as a replacement ) - No facility for external audio in video mode. ( but the inbuilt mic is good! ) - Body Grip is not so good ( as compared to other models ) Don't get bothered about the megapixel count , it hardly matters for a DSLR , especially at the entry level. If you are on a tight budget do not pay attention to the cons , just buy this. You will learn to compensate these petty short comings with a little experience in the art photography.

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

This is a gift for someone so I have to wait for a few days to say if everything is good with the camera. A broken seal is definitely a BIG disappointment.

Outdoor pictures are great , nice & sharp details , give high resolution pics ( 16megapixel ) . Auto mode is awesome , other shooting modes for example super vivid , low light , long exposure , Live modes are super too , helps you in customize the shots. The P mode is available for fully personalized pic taking for experienced hands. Auto generally does all the job for you and does it great. three type of Auto Focus frame are available , Face detection , tracking and center. Three types of Focus available : Near , Normal , Infinity Three types of powerful flash : Auto , On , Slow Sync Digital Zoom is great but hard to take a stable shot with full zoom on. Video Recording is awesome , HD videos at 25fps , downside : If ur using the cam in low light indoors & flash if off , it will produce noise or darker images. Try switching to Auto with flash on or to low light mode with Flash on , and it will do the trick. All in all great Cam for starters an light occasional picture taking in a very low price.

Once I actually receive the product , I will write a review of the product and may be revise my rating about FK and product. === Edited / addendum === ( + ) - the camera is quite sleek - image quality is very good. - flash output is good for close range shots. - image noise is well controlled. - battery seems to be ok. Haven't tested it by running to 0 charge. (-) - battery + battery compartment can give you troubles , beware. the battery goes into the compartment either ways , but you will be able to close the battery cover flap only on the correct alignment. - the battery cover flap is quite delicate. - flash range is less for a large group photo in low light. i was scared i will break it I will rate the camera 4 ( 1 star less for the battery compartment and battery cover flap ) rating for seller / deliver still remains 1 star!

Used this camera for 15 days. Image quality is not good , there will be noise in the images and in low light , image quality will become worse. In a single line i want to conclude that if u have used SLR or some other good quality camera then u will remain unsatisfied with the image quality but if u r using this camera as a suppliment thing for occasional use then u may find dis product useful.

Pathetic camera! you get what you pay for On time delivery and good packaging from flipkart. Too bad images in dark ( i tried almost all the available settings still no use :( ) Even in good sunlilght images are almost the quality you get on cheap cellphones. Terrible , terrible waste of money , now I have to find something good. I have used Canon powershot A470 in past and it was way better than this Ixus 145.

Please also consider the points below : # It is not an AW model , so buy a rain cover separately. # It is mainly designed to carry 'One Body' and 2 - 3 lenses and a 17inch laptop. # Doesnt have a good option to carry a heavy tripod. # Shoulder Straps are thinly padded. # Your camera stays at the botom compartment , so be careful while you put the bag down. # No Option to install a lock. # The main separator is not adjustable in case you have more clothes and less equipmets , bad for ladies. So as i said in the title , it is an excellent overnigher for a smart photo journalist , but definitely not for a serious professional who carries a hell lot of camera bodies , lenses , and what not!

There is also another small removable pouch inside. You could even put a novel or a couple of t - shirts too in this compartment. There is also an exterior pouch for putting your water bottle. 2 slide open pouches to keep things like tour guides , maps and other small documents. Coming to comfort , the slings are meshed and also provides lumbar support. additional waist attachment to reduce stress on shoulders and balances the lumbar during hiking and trekking. The only drawback I found in this bag was that it isn't rain proof nor does it have a waterproof bag , so do carry an umbrella with you if you are trekking during rainy seasons.... The bag is water proof , which means slight sprinkles and water spills , but no equipped to last a torrential rain etc... Definitely a very good back worth its price and space.

Very Bad Experience First of all I got the item after 2 days delay. I tried to take some snaps and the lence got stuck and the camera became in a hang mode. Tried recharging the battery and turning on the Camera , but the camera doen not move further after displaying the initial screen. It was hung with the lence out.

Its a nice Camera and a superb quality product as Sony always maintains. Nice Zoom , Manual Settings , Auto Corrections , Image stability , fine pixels , nice grip in hands ( far better then nikon l820 ), good video quality ( no zooming issues as in l820 ) over all very good.

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great. Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

Outdoor pictures are great , nice & sharp details , give high resolution pics ( 16megapixel ) . Auto mode is awesome , other shooting modes for example super vivid , low light , long exposure , Live modes are super too , helps you in customize the shots. The P mode is available for fully personalized pic taking for experienced hands. Auto generally does all the job for you and does it great. three type of Auto Focus frame are available , Face detection , tracking and center. Three types of Focus available : Near , Normal , Infinity Three types of powerful flash : Auto , On , Slow Sync Digital Zoom is great but hard to take a stable shot with full zoom on. Video Recording is awesome , HD videos at 25fps , downside : If ur using the cam in low light indoors & flash if off , it will produce noise or darker images. Try switching to Auto with flash on or to low light mode with Flash on , and it will do the trick. All in all great Cam for starters an light occasional picture taking in a very low price.

Haven't tested it by running to 0 charge. (-) - battery + battery compartment can give you troubles , beware. the battery goes into the compartment either ways , but you will be able to close the battery cover flap only on the correct alignment. - the battery cover flap is quite delicate. - flash range is less for a large group photo in low light. i was scared i will break it I will rate the camera 4 ( 1 star less for the battery compartment and battery cover flap ) rating for seller / deliver still remains 1 star!

To mention a few - STRENGTHS - Low noise ( grain ) at high ISO's / good image quality and colour depth / flip out screens / focus continuously while recording movies / in - camera HDR ( high dynamic range ) WEAKNESSES - No focus motor / slow max shutter speed ( 1 / 4000 of a second ) / no image stabilization / no panorama mode / slow continuous shooting ( 5fps on D5200 vs 4fps on D5100 ) DIFFERENCES - D5100 is a good 10k less than D5200 with the 18 - 55mm kit lens / longer battery life in D5100 So why should one buy a D5200??? 1. Many more focus points - 39 vs 11 2. Much higher resolution - 24MP vs 16.1MP 3. More cross - type focus points - 9 vs 1 4. Shoots faster - 5fps vs 4fps 5. In - built audio - Stereo vs Mono D5100 was launched in April 2011 I have not had a proper opportunity to put my camera through the grid but the few shots taken are simply amazing. I will probably write another review later. I am a complete amateur so far as photography goes but learning everyday. Hope the above helps...

New feature of using it with WR - R10 will be a plus point to those who want wireless. Megapixel has been upgraded from 16mp to 24mp though I am not a pixel peeper.. In nut and shell I can say that it has stolen most of the qualities of D7000 that includes 39 autofocus. Ofcource at this price no company would give you a metal body with prosumer grade dslr qualities . One good thing is that it has a fantastic metering and has no over exposure and back focus problem like D7000. Nikon has worked nicely on it. So that is why I would recommend this product to you....

Stick with D5100 , it is the best in its category and will give you amazing shots. Use extra 10K to get a good lens. This does not mean that D5200 is bad. It is very good , but my vote goes to D5100.

Marvelous job FlipKart. I have a passion for photography. Having said that , I am no expert on DSLR's. To satiate my passion , I first bought myself Cannon EOS 1000D and used it extensively for shooting portraits , wildlife , nature , buildings etcetra over a 3 year period. I was impressed with the pictures until i came across a friend who showed the images he had shot using Nikon D5100. Despite lacking in professional knowledge on photography , i could easily see the difference in sharpness and quality of images. Nikon was definitely in a different league. I decided to progress to the next level and buy a Nikon. Before purchase , i did my research by comparing Nikon with Cannon. I was glad that Nikon camera's scored higher on various parameters when compared with a relative product manufactured by Cannon. I brought down my search to two products of Nikon , D90 and D5200. I spent sometime studying both. And finally decided to go in for D5200 buoyed by the various modes of photography offered on this camera. Despite my research i was tentative since i was not paying peanuts for this camera. When i finally got the camera , I started exploring it. I was fascinated with the choice of modes , the menu options , the image quality , size , flash effect to mention a few. The camera also enables you to shoot using various effects instead of editing using applications. The camera came with an 18 - 55 mm VR kit lens. I have shot portraits , buildings and nature using this product. And boy have i been impressed with the images. My journey with this fascinating product has just begun. So far so good!

This camera brings features of high end Nikon cameras in this price range and will make for an ultimate all in one camera for atleast 4 years from now. Good investment !

I finally went for tamron and believe me guys i made the right choice. tamaron is so much better ( really much better ) than other two because , 1. sharpness is excellent better than those two for surely ( tested ) . 2. CA ( chromatic aberrations ) are manageable but till now i havent seen any!! @ 300mm!!. 3. focusing is a tad bit better than sigma...and nikon lens does not have the af - motor at all!! 4.i feel that af - noise is not that much at all because u will be concentrating on the subject that u wont notice it at all , but its audible though not loud. when its fully extended its like an rpg launcher!! which can make other guys drool!! also if u are using a dx - apc cropped sensor camera then this types of lens is must have because they have sweet spot which really helps in macro...and this lens does have macro ( but not true macro but its awesome! ) so should u go for it or what?? 1.if u are restricted by ur budget then this is the best choice / buy u can make , seriously trust me. 2.if u are willing to pay more for a better lens u have nikon's own range and also tamron's higher version of the same which is like 15k more!! now bad points this is for all the three lens , 1.@ > 200mm the sharpness becomes soft but not by a large margin. 2.@ > 200mm shakes are inevitable..hence u need a monopod or tripod. 3.this lens is extremely sharp around f / 8 & f / 11 ( which is good ) hence in low light this struggles to perform and the pics are worse.

Let me tell you that after I bought it , I shot wildlife / birds photos at 300 mm & never felt softness or fall of sharpness in photos...next fact is that VR or IS or VC ( vibration control ) is required if shutter speed is slower than about 1 / 125 sec , now do you think that wildlife photos are shot at any shutter speed below 1 / 125 sec???...Common just think...so any shutter speed above that will not require any VR / IS / VC facility ( for this you have to pay thrice more money ) . ALso note that all camera companies advise to switch off VR / IS / VC option while using TRIPOD...WHY?...Bcoz it reduces sharpness of picture !!! So we can conclude that no need to pay thrice amount for VR / IS / VC ..its a mental obsession...Just keep shutter speed at above 1 / 125 sec & be steady , also learn how to hold DSLR...GREAT PHOTOS CAN BE SHOT AT 300 mm also ! And any Telephoto with f / 4 - 5.6 will hunt for auto focus a bit...so it is not a problem with this only...but still it does not hunt a lot. SO I AM FULLY SATISFIED USING IT WITH MY Nikon D 5100 .

I did not buy it from flipkart , sorry , I found a cheaper option at a local dealer but I have bought stuff from flipkart before and their service is always commendable unless in extreme circumstances. Bottom line : 1. If you are a novice , like me , you should think of this especially if you are on a tight budget. 2. Offers great zoom , definitely during bright light settings. P.S. @ all those who say this is a bad lens , you either do not know how to use the DSLR yet , or you are just simply doing it wrong.

Bottom line , if you're looking for a lens with a working range of 70 - 200 with the ocasional foray above 200mm this lens is a good value. Do read it . Very good image quality for an inexpensive lens , better than the Nikon and Canon equivalents. Well worth using. Build quality better than you have a right to expect at this price point and image quality is pretty decent. PROS : - Cheap , Very good at f8 , small and light , great DOF CONS : - Slow AF , Image quality at 200 - 300mm , CA´s , but only in very contrasty situations , easy to remove in PS CA = chromatic Aberration.

First of all about VR and all that stabilization stuff , somebody below has said correctly , shoot with shutter speed 1 / 125 and more , it will be taken care of. Most of our photography we do anyways in daylight , so maintaining that shutter speed with some ISO changes will not be an issue. For Macro , it's good for flower close - ups only , it will not magnify the fly's eyes for you , but as it's a bonus I will not complain. For Macros though a tripod is recommended ( which is applicable for most of the Macro lenses ) If you have used the 18 - 55 only till now , you will get more flexibilty an doptions while using this for potraits. All in all I highly recommend it for first time buyers ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 2 of 2 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse</DIV></DIV>

Battry consumption This camera is handy and good for non professionals.Picture quality perfect.Zoom best. But this is battery consuming. I was using normal pencil batteries and while flash is on within three clicks battery is down.Without flash battery exhausted in 15 clicks. Hope there will be some solution to it.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

It has excellent picture quality ( way better than point and shoots offering higher megapixels ) Has intuitive modes which help you whenever you dont feel like going manual. Also , the package containing the 55 - 250 mm lens is a good deal coz sooner or later one tends to buy zoom lenses. Overall i think this double kit pack is one to go far.

I have loved using this telephoto at a corporate football tournament my firm took part in and on safari. the IS is great. ( reaches out to 400mm when you take into account the 1.6 crop factor ) This is my first DSLR and I didn't want to make the mistake many first time DSLR buyers make which is to spend all / most of their money on the best body they can afford and then have no money for the lens / es they want. This camera has been great , takes great picture , it does everything a good DSLR should and well , and it will be a long time before your skill as a photographer exceeds the capabilities of this camera. That being said , my sister bought herself the 550D and for the price difference , if your budget permits , it really is more than worth it and I would recommend you go for the 550D. ( Especially if you want to record video ) The next lens I'm looking at buying is either the Cannon 35mm f / 2 or the Cannon 50mm f / 1.8 , but you should look at what lens will suit your style of photography.

Choose to Use I bought the EOS 1100D from Flipkart this month. For the starters , delivery was top of the Class. Delivered the Camera 1 day before the scheduled date. It as an awesome camera for amateurs entering into the DSLR's. The quality of pictures are really great. Trust me , this Camera is worth every penny I had spent on it. Love it.

The Canon EOS 1100D - Camera & The Deal The Canon EOS 1100D is a fantastic DSLR camera for beginners. The wide range for ISO Rating , Shutter Speed & Focal Length settings is great. So , this is a very good camera to start with if you are interested in good photography. You can learn professional photography & build up your interest on photography with this camera and then after a few years you can upgrade to a higher - end model if you feel like. The best part was the deal given by Flipkart during the Diwali sale in Oct 2013. Just the camera & the 18 - 55mm lens kit costs about 31 , 000 /- . Now the telephoto Canon lens of 55 - 250mm … The Canon EOS 1100D is a fantastic DSLR camera for beginners. The wide range for ISO Rating , Shutter Speed & Focal Length settings is great. So , this is a very good camera to start with if you are interested in good photography.

The best part was the deal given by Flipkart during the Diwali sale in Oct 2013. Just the camera & the 18 - 55mm lens kit costs about 31 , 000 /- . Now the telephoto Canon lens of 55 - 250mm would cost approx 17 , 500 /- if you want to buy it separately. But the deal gives you both lenses & the camera body at just 31 , 000 /- . That's quite a deal. Because for all digital SLRs two lenses are a must : 18 - 55mm & 55 - 250mm or 18 - 55mm & 70 - 300mm. And lastly , needless to say , The Canon brand name also matters. We all know that the worlds best two camera manufacturing brands are Canon & Nikon. Most of the professional photographers in the world use these brands. So what more can you ask for at this price !! However , Always Remember : Buying the world's most expensive camera , just because you can afford it , does not make you a great photographer. A good photographer can take breath - taking pictures with just an ordinary camera. So it is upon how well you know your job rather than how expensive your equipment is. It's just like the old saying - "A true musician can make the cheapest instrument sing" !!

For 9k , you get an awesome camera , a 8Gb memory card and a decent carry case. I don't think you can ask for more value at this cost. But , then again , that's just my humble opinion.

This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer , Blink Proof alerting and Red - Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p. It takes very sharp images in daylight and indoors. One of the cons of this camera is that low light photography is a bit blurry but still decent. A 4GB SDHC card is provided along with the camera.

Coming back to the camera , I found it pleasing to the eye , low start - up time , and a very loong lense..... Pros ; 1. Outdoor shots are crisp & clear. 2. Good color rendition. 3. HDR works! 4. full HD video , and 60FPS & 120FPS too! Cons ; 1. at the tele end , AF doesn't work. So is when doing macro in low - light. 2. No manual control for Shutter speed & Aperture. 3. No VF 4. For HDR , Burst & Panorama , it is advised that you use a tripod. Overall verdict ; A nice camera that gives VFM , only if you are into shooting Family pics , weddings and casual stuff... If you are serious about your PG - phy , go for something else ; As a person who once owned a true SLR ( FILM ), I found this camera lacks in many fronts ; but a SLR is a SLR..... :) Happy shooting ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 14 of 16 users found this review helpful.

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great. Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

I bought this camera last month and i found it so user friendly & in my budget. I liked the high optical zoom. The image quality is crystal clear. The best feature is that i can click pics with blurred background which i always have been fond of. I recommend this camera for those who want to start photographing for the first time.

Yes I know you may be tempted by cheaper offerings from Tamron , Sigma or even the uber cheap Nikon AF 70 - 300 , but if you can afford , this is the best for an amateur. I have personally used both the Tamron and Sigma , 70 - 300 variants for more than a month ( borrowed from friends ) . What I sorely missed in them is the VR. If you cross 200 , its absolutely impossible to take handheld pictures with them. Besides , after crossing 200 , pictures become visibly soft , specially at the corners. Colour fringing is pretty evident in both of them. Compared to them , this lens is absolutely a pleasure to use. Even at 300 with lens wide open ( at the largest aperture ), there is minimal softness. Colour fringing is there but its negligible. And the VR - II system of the lens is absolutely wonderful. I got pretty decent handheld images at 300mm , even at a relatively lower shutter speed ( 1 / 30th of a second ) at dimming light. Having said that , there are a couple of weak points in this lens. 1. The minimum focusing distance is 1.4 meters , almost 5 feet. So macro shots are ruled out. 2. Focusing is tad slow. Focus hunts in low light conditions. Not much of a con out there. The pros far outweigh the cons . So that's my review. Go for it , you won't regret your investment. And if you have even more money to spend , go for the Nikon 70 - 300mm. Its the best entry - level consumer lens that you can get. ( For you folks out there who can't decide between the Tamron 70 - 300mm and Sigma 70 - 300mm , my advice it go for Tamron. Its a tad better. ) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 37 of 37 users found this review helpful.

Delivery was very good and I received my lens well packed and undamaged. Those who want to purchase this lens , please remember that this is not an all purpose zoom lens & this is not a pro lens. This lens works best and gives amazing photos in bright light. Taking handheld photos in low light conditions is difficult & sometimes not possible at all. Ofcourse you can solve this problem by using tripod & remote shutter release. Increasing ISO value is not a good solution since beyond ISO 800 , pictures will have substantial amount of noise & it will require postprocessing in some software. Lens gives excellent photographs in 55 - 200mm range wide open. 200 - 300mm will give you good photographs , but not always. In this rage , lens loses its sharpness and images become somewhat soft. This is not a very fast lens. So photographing moving objects in low light conditions will not be possible. After 200mm , lens shows substantial signs of chromatic aberration ( CA ) as the object you are focusing on becomes smaller. e.g. You will get less or no CA if you photographs a building , but if you take photo of a bird at same distance & focal length , then you will notice signs of CA. This lens is not meant for macro photography. Minimum focus distance for this lens is substantially higher than true macro lenses. Hence crop becomes a must. VRII is good. This is a DX format lens. So you can not use it with FX format sensors , even though both format cameras have same F - mount. If you are planning to upgrade to FX body in future , then go for 70 - 300 instead. If used with FX sensor , then images will have vignetting. Autofocus is slower than my expectations. There is no auto manual override over autfocus. So you have to fiddle with A / M button to change from autofocus to manual focus. This is not a headache as long as you are not doing macro photography of moving objects. After 135mm , you will notice slight signs of distortion , but this is not a concern at all and is okay for this family of lenses. Build quality of the lens is good , esp. since this lens has metal mount , so it will stand good wear and tear. 55 - 200 lens has a plastic mount and it wears down easily if lenses are interchanged regularly. So with metal mount , this lens is good. Using manual focus is bit harder and focus ring is at a bit odd location. But you can overcome this by practice. Just from some tests I did with this lens , i found out that at full 300mm focus , good images are produced beyond shutter speed of 1 / 60 or faster. Slower than 1 / 60 and images can even be unusable sometimes. But all in all , this lens is very good at this price point. Do buy it. You will love the images it produces. I hope my review gives you an unbiased idea about how the lens is and helps you make your choice. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 33 of 33 users found this review helpful.

Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Siddharth Rao Jan 31 , 2012 Good Lens to have I have been using the 55 - 300 along with my standard 18 - 55mm Nikkor , and must say its a very good combo. I have used it for some wildlife photography and the results are definitely more than satisfactory. Its an awesome lens and there is no 2nd thoughts about it. The VR too is a must have , as per me. This really reduces the use of a tripod plus other advantages , shell out a bit more for the VR variant , if given a choice. One combo would be to have one 18 - 55 and a 55 - 300 / 70 - 300. Another choice would be to go for one single , the awesome , 18 - 200mm. But it all boils down to your budget… I have been using the 55 - 300 along with my standard 18 - 55mm Nikkor , and must say its a very good combo.

Recommended Zoom lens for your DSLR One of the wonderfully crafted lenses for Nikon DX format cameras , I was initially not able to decide between Nikon 55 - 300 & Tamron / Sigma 70 - 300mm lenses , however after a brief research i found both the other brands lacked VR which is very much required for Zoom lenses & Nikon 55 - 300 has VR II which significantly minimizes camera shakes at long range photos. You would not believe if i tell you , it is also a portrait lens , which means you can take beautiful pictures of your friends & family at 80mm - 100mm with full bokeh.

Good build quality with metal F mounts. Cons : 1. Slow Auto - focus system , takes sometime to lock picture at high focal ranges. 2. Noisy magnetic sound when used for movie recording under Live - view ( this can be controlled by switching off VR ) 3. not a low - light lens , struggles during night times to lock the object 4. little heavier compared to tamron / sigma brands Over all its a beautiful lens for amateur photographer & it deserves 4 stars.

And its hardware features is being compared to Nikon Flagship Camera D800. Let me tell you why this camera is better than others. - Sensor of D3200 is second best sensor amongst all hi - end cameras. - Processor of D3200 is same as Nikon Flagship Camera D4 ( Reader can find it on Nikon site ) People ( all of us ) who claim that image quality and ISO sensitivity of D5100 is better than D3200 because they are just reading testing lab result , otherwise normal or expert user can't tell the distinguish be it D3100 / D3200 or 550D / 600D. I just started using this camera and have posted some pix on my facebook and flickr and I got really really good response. And above all , I would like to thanks "Flipkart Team" who helped me get my dream fulfilled. I got my camera before the committed time i.e. in less than 24 hr of my purchase order. ( except Sunday ) . I am giving this Camera 4 out 5 star because my hands are bigger and size of this camera is bit small for me. :) PS : This is unbiased feedback. I am praising D3200 not for that because I have bought it. I just wanted to buy latest launched camera. D3200 was launched in April 2012. Rest are almost 2 years old cameras. But still I love D3100 / D5100 / 550D / 660D , because all are same. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 74 of 82 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Ravi S. Nov 17 , 2012 D5100 vs. D3200 Here are a few reasons to go for the D5100 over the D3200 , for those who are undecided and just can't make up their minds : ( 1 ) Better low - light performance - with 16.2MPixels , the noise at high - ISO settings is better than the D3200 ( which provides 24MPixels on a marginally smaller sensor ) . The 24MPixels gives the D3200 a resolution of ~129 line - pairs / mm , while the 16.2 MPixels gives the D5100 a resolution of ~104 lp / mm. Even a high - end exotic lens will provide a maximum optical resolution of ~50 lp / mm , which means that the 104 lp / mm sensor of the D5100 already outresolves the lens. So… Here are a few reasons to go for the D5100 over the D3200 , for those who are undecided and just can't make up their minds : ( 1 ) Better low - light performance - with 16.2MPixels , the noise at high - ISO settings is better than the D3200 ( which provides 24MPixels on a marginally smaller sensor ) .

So go for the lower noise , better low light performing D5100. ( 2 ) Auto exposure and white balance bracketing : Believe it or not , the D3200 does not have an AE / WB bracketing option! The D5100 on the other hand allows auto - bracketing in 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 stop increments , and in addition , provides an in - camera HDR option ( which I rarely use , but there it is ) . ( 3 ) Active D - Lighting : More options in the D5100 ( Auto , High+ , High , Normal , Low ), i.e. more control for improving dynamic range , vs. ADL on / off in the D3200. ( 4 ) Less expensive : Save your money on the body and use it on the lenses - go for the 70 - 300mm / 55 - 300mm zoom , or the 50mm / 1.8G prime lens to complement the 18 - 55mm kit lens. ( 5 ) And of course , there's the flip - out screen in the D5100. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 51 of 59 users found this review helpful.

Autofocus Motor.. ( body AF motor lets you to auto focus with more lenses )--- 600D - Body AF motor D5100 - Lens Af motor D3200 - Lens Af motor 3. HDR mode.. ( it lets you get high image dynamic range even in backlight situations )--- D5100 has HDR mode , which is nice , but you can also do that with D3200 or 600D , later in any editing software.. 4. AF points.. ( helps to focus perfectly )--- 600D - 9 AF points. D5100 - 11 AF points. D3200 - 11 AF points. 5. Night shooting -- D3200 is simply better than others in this case , it has very low noise levels even in higher iso settings , trust me , this is amazing. 6. Colour depth and Image quality -- D3200 has much better colour depth , higher image quality , wide dynamic range than others in this case. 7. Sensor size -- D3200 and D5100 both have about 10% larger sensor than 600D 8. Battery life -- D5100 -- 660 shots D3200 -- 540 shots 600D -- 440 shots 9. Flip out screen.. ( good for video shooting )-- D5100 -- Yes 600D -- Yes D3200 -- No 10. Video quality -- all the cameras have Full HD 1080p video shooting mode , but D3200 has continous autofocus system in video mode , it is a very nice feature...on the other hand 600D has much more manual control on video shooting.. Finally I can recommend you to buy D3200 if you are really interested in still photography and also videography. I am sure this product will satisfy all your needs , but if you want much more control on video shooting you may consider buying 600D. ( but keep it on mind that D3200 is much better in image quality , color depth , night photography , dynamic range , image resolution than 600D ) . I am currently using Nikon D3200 , and trust me , you won't regret this buy.... Another thing is that if you are ready to pay about 10k more then you may buy Nikon D5200 , which is a really beautiful camera. D5200 has all the good features of these 3 cameras..

I bought "Nikon Speedlight SB - 400" and its worth. But again , its an optional one. I bought it in G.K Vale for ~37K ( tripod , uv filter , 4GB memory card , bag , lens cleaning set and 100 free photographs in g.k vale ) It was not available in flipkart that time but now it has with better price.

ZOOOM BOSS extremely good product. 60 x zoom is what attracted me to the product. and also the pricing which is quite affordable considering you want such good zoom. I dnt think any other brand offers it in this price range and Nikon can't be compared to others. Only thing I found a little disheartening was that the autofocus on the subject while zooming is a tad slow compared to other cameras and even compared to Nikon L830 which has 30x zoom. Otherwise its cool.

Sony DSC - HX300 ( 50x zoom , 1 / 2.3inch -- A safe buy for beginners ) And of course have a fifth option that is NIKON , full of Cons. Now let us discuss why! A. NIKKOR lens is slow , full of error ( aberrations ), aperture is extremely small in the tele end. B. Even Canon has the similar aperture ( smaller in the tele ends ) but its ISO Sensitivity is Super Fine , that more than compensates the smaller aperture. Even at 1600 ISO , Canon gives negligible noise. Whereas , in NIKON , you'll feel like vomiting if you look at pictures at 400 ISO. C. Image Stabilization : At any point beyond 20x zoom in any camera , what you'll need is a powerful image stabilizer , either a Optical of Digital one. All that matters is the result. FUJI Optical Image Stabilizer OR SONY DIGITAL STABILIZER works equally good but here CANON wins the bet. It combines Vibration Reducing Lens technology along with Digital Image Stabilizer ( Through DIGIC 5 Processor ) to give MARVELOUS result. The CANON frame - assist will blow your mind. Well , Nikon Image Stabilizer? Sssucsxxx. D. HOT SHOE : CANON / FUJI -- Yes *VS* NIKON -- No. ( Hot Shoe enables you to add external accessories like BOOM Mike or 2ndary Flash etc ) E. Digital Zoom Performance : While canon displays excellent result for upto 4x digital zoom , Nikon SUCKSSS even at 2x. F. AUTO Mode : If you are a beginner and depend much on Auto mode , better go for SONY of FUJI. Because auto modes much depends on SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE , hence companies like SONY or Samsung which has evident presence in software industry , excels in optimizing auto - mode performances. Result wise FUJI and CANON auto modes are also acceptable to good extent. But Nikon! Simply GOOD for Nothing. My nikon Point and Shoot fails in face - detection most of the times. G. Auto Focus : Here , FUJI excels. Takes 0.03 sec time to focus ( Phase Detect ) . Canon comes second with 0.16 sec ( Contrast Detect ) . With these two cameras , you're safe. It reduces chances of being out - of - focus in fast moving situations. In my own experience , NIKON TAKES AT LEAST 2 SECOND TO FOCUS. H. FUJI and SONY features a vivid range of different shooting modes which ease your shooting. Nikon features much less ( Just use COMPARE option in flipkart ) . I. PICTURE QUALITY : Canon -- You'll love it. Even at Full Crop , they are crisp. SONY -- Its good too. But at full crop it'll look like oil paint. Still better than Noise. FUJI -- Somewhat OK. But at full zoom some noise appears Panasonic -- EXCELLENT. NIKON -- In daylight : Not Bad. In Low Light : You'll Vomit on them. J. AFTER SALES : Fuji features dealer's after sales ( The shop you buy from will take care of any issues ) . You don't have to spend hours on internet finding Service Center , though it has quite good amount of Service Centers across India. Also Canon has enough service centers across cities in India but Panasonic Lags in this field. Well. Now Nikon : Yes you'll manage to find one or two service centers in your metro cities but my own experience is pretty bad. The service guys cant see the noise spots on your display screen of dont understand lowlight performance issues. Even inside a room full of lights my camera needs Flash to capture faster than 1 / 40 speed and as per the Service Guy , this is quite good performance. So here's my arguement based on personal experiences. DONT BUY NIKON. It'll frustrate you on every single occurrances.

We did lot of research and found 2 options for myself 1 ) D SLR 2 ) Point & Shoot Camera After a detailed research we found Nikon Cool Pix 600 and found value for money and best device in the segment. The level of zoom it has and other capabilities will make you mesmerised. Amazingly superb device for novice users. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 2 of 2 users found this review helpful.

Nice Camera n Awesome Flipkart Service I received my order for this camera a few days ago....... I am really satisfied with flipkart service as the delivery was made one day before the expected date. This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer , Blink Proof alerting and Red - Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p. It takes very sharp images in daylight and indoors. One of the cons of this camera is that low light photography is a bit blurry but still decent. A 4GB SDHC card is provided along with the camera.

No issues what so ever. The bag is compact and the material used is of very high quality. The zippers are also great. My 15.6 inch dell laptop is on the heavier and bulkier side. Though the bag could fit in my laptop , but when i included both the laptop and the camera along with my two other lenses i found that the bag was very heavy and uneasy to carry. This bag is better for those who have a thin and not so heavy laptop along with a medium size dslr. The shoulder straps are very comfortable and i was able to carry it for more than 3 hours without any pain and uneasiness. But remember the bag cannot stand by on its own , so you have to put it along the side of a wall or tree. Don't leave it on benches or higher surface without any support. It might fall and damage your gear. So be careful. Its designed for general day to day use and don't expect to fit in all of your camera gear. Finally to the important thing the side access for dslr. It works super fast and is very convenient. Pros : 1. Compact. 2. Can hold my laptop and my camera gear as mentioned ( but bag becomes heavy to carry ) . 3. Side access is great. 4. Comfortable. 5. High quality build ( expected from Lowepro ) . Cons : 1. Cannot stand on its own. 2. Uneasy to carry with both laptop and camera gear. Personal note : This bag is great for me and i like it very much. If you want a bag which can hold more camera gear along with the laptop check out Lowepro Fastpack 250 Multi Use Backpack. I chose compuday photo 250 because of its price and i have less gear. So it made sense to me. Another thing i want to mention is that I bought this bag from flipkart only , but i got this bag on a lesser price than what they have mentioned now ( Rs.4165 ) .So check the price with local dealers also. If any doubts try to write in this comments section. I will try to help. I would definitely recommend this bag. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 13 of 13 users found this review helpful.

It is mercifully plain and devoid of myriad straps , buckles and exterior pockets. If you want to shlep all your photography gear over rough terrain , this bag is not for you ; but if you want to spend the day roaming around clicking some pics without feeling like a turtle , it's just the ticket. The bag has a padded laptop pocket that can accommodate a 15.6" laptop snugly. My Asus N550 ( 15 x 10 x 1.1 inches ) just fits in , which is fine by me , but it is a tight fit at the top. The padding is just adequate ; if my laptop was smaller I would put some extra padding at the bottom of the laptop pocket. The distinctive feature , of course , is the side opening camera pocket which is very useful. You can quickly get to the camera while generally keeping it protected in the bag without needing a dorky - looking camera bag. If you do a lot of yoga , you can probably get the camera out with the bag on your back ; the rest of us can slip the strap off our right shoulder and swing the bag round to bring the side pocket into view. There is a handy Velcro fixed panel that helps reduce the probability of inadvertently dropping the camera. The side pocket is big enough to accommodate my D90 with a 70 - 300mm zoom. I recommend putting only the camera in the side pocket as other stuff might drop out when getting the camera. You will have to resign yourself to rummaging in the main compartment when you want to change lenses. There is a reasonable amount of space left in the main pocket for a flash and a few lenses , plus the usual snacks and junk that we lug around on day trips. There are a couple of other thin pockets in the main compartment and on the back that are useful for organizing your junk , books etc. On the outside , opposite the side pocket , there is one of those elasticated pockets for keeping a bottle of water which , again is nice. There is nowhere to mount a tripod , but we can't take tripods into historic sites in India anyway. Overall , the appearance is acceptable , the design is great and the build quality is good for the price point. This is the best bag I have found for the casual photographer roaming around India's wonderful historic sites. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful.

Small zipper compartments on the outside can hold a couple of filters. There is a compartment just behind ones back , on the top , that easily fits my 7 inch tablet. Very spacious. I would give five starts for space. Quality of the fabric used to make the bag is pretty decent and rugged. Cons : Zippers are not of the best quality. Needs a little tugging to get them around. Just a minor hiccup. The inner ( main ) compartment has some kind of felt - cloth like lining. A little of the fine lint ( fine cotton ) is sticking to the rubber grip of the body when taken out. May happen with any other rubberized stuff we put in there. The compartment separators have the male part of the velcro , but there is no velcro lining on the inside of the main compartment. What was flipkart thinking here? The velcro barely manages to stick to the felt - like lining on the inside. Mind you , BARELY MANAGES to. Not a very huge concern if the compartment is filled with gear though , as the stuff inside will then be closely packed without moving around much. Bottomline : Beginners : This is an OK deal , considering the price. A camera backpack from any other brand is priced higher and would be smaller too. This would do the job just right , to get rid of the messenger bag you get along with the DSLR kit. Pro’s : What are you even doing on this page??

Let me tell my gears first just to get an idea about its capacity. 1. Nikon D - 3000 2. Nikon F - 80 3. Nikon AF - S DX Nikkor 18 - 55 mm f / 3.5 - 5.6G VR 4. Nikon AF - S DX Nikkor 55 - 300 mm f / 4.5 - 5.6G ED VR 5. Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f / 1.8D 6. Nikon AF Nikkor 28 - 105 f / 3.5 - 4.5D 7. Few filters ( inc. C - Pl , Vari ND , G - ND , UV , Skylight ) 8. Extra Cell for both the cameras 9. Cables , remote shutter release , and other accessories , includes few rolls of film 10. A tripod. Now about the capacity , I was able to pack everything ( except the tripod , for obvious reasons ) inside the bottom main compartment , and the top is free to keep some other materials. Let me now go to rate this product : 1. Space : 5* , nothing can be said about this , I have still space left. 2. Build Quality : 4.5* , padding is good , in the inside also the had provided velcro , both male & female is available , the female part is provided all around , so as to customize the inside ( unlike reported earlier , and this is a welcome change ) . Stitching and zip quality is ok , that's why I am not giving it 5*. 3. Ergonomics : 4* , the straps are just ok , even any laptop carrying backpacks are having much better straps. also to take the camera out from the bag while on the move , one needs to place the bag on something , and then open the zip for the compartment. Again considering the price , a 4* can surely be awarded. 4. Looks : 5* , I would give it a 5* , just because it looks so backpack type that none would think that it may contain camera , while travelling in a public transport. This may vary from person to person. Cons : 1. a bit heavy 2. taking out a camera on the go Overall verdict : 1. Considering the price of the product , at sub 1500 /- level , this bag surely deserves a 5* rating. Though I have omitted the durability aspect for obvious reasons ( I got this bag just in my hand , and if it fails to last long , I shall change this rating accordingly ) . 2. Last but not the least , the flipkart delivery , I ordered this product yesterday in the forenoon , and was delivered at my doorstep today afternoon , a truly 7* performance.

All in all , a great product that can be used and appreciated by all spectrum of users ( especially in this price range ) . I hope to see in the future some more of flipkart's great products , which are fully worth the money spent. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 5 of 7 users found this review helpful.

A very good bag for upto two lenses I have been using this bag for nearly a month now and have been able to comfortable and safely put two lenses along with my Canon EOS 550D. One lens is 18 - 55mm and other one is a 70 - 300mm lens. There are several adjustable pockets in the lower chamber of the bag. I can comfortable place the 2nd lens in the side pocket , and the camera with the other lens fitted in another pocket.

The 3rd pocket is for other stuff like charger , etc. I still have space in another pocket for lens filters , hood etc. I added some padding myself to ensure safety of the camera gear on the floor of the bag and on the sides to be extra careful. However the bag is decent for the price - a value for money and with lots of space that you carry as a back - pack. The top compartment - that has a separate zip from the lower one - is where I can keep anything else ( towel , cap - anything that carries my stuff and also acts like a cushion ) . Overall - A good buy. What I like the most - The delivery time and packaging of Flipkart. Their service is unmatched and outstanding almost always.

I have a Nikon D5200 With Kit lens , Sigma 18 - 250 and Nikkor 50 MM prime lens and a set of UV , Color , Polorizer and 3 ND filter , a Simplex 2400 tripod. I have packed everything into it and I find i can still add another couple of lens into the bag easily. I find the professional camera bag of this size costing around 8000 - 9000. The form backing is also good and offers a excellent protection to the gear. Thus looking at the price point this one has a huge cost advantage. There are few disadvantages 1. The bag is slightly heavy. And putting in all ur gear is going to make it more heavier. 2. The zipper quality is on the low side. 3. At some places the finish is not that good. Any way for 1250 Rs its difficult to expect everything. In short this is a good buy. I would be happy if Digiflip comes out with a camera bag which can accommodate a 15 inch laptop and a charger. U always need to carry ur laptop when u go for tour and trek. carrying two separate bags for a laptop and camera makes it more uncomfortable. Just a recommendation.

Well Designed Great Product for this price. I would highly recommend this product to every person using a DSLR. For a professional this a great backup , and for an amature this is all you will need. it packs in a lens attached to the body with extra 3 - 4 lenses and an extra flash gun. The padding is just perfect. The top compartment will fit a lot of other stuff and still end up with some more space. This product is well designed by Digiflip part of Flipkart and has a 1 year limited warranty. The design resembles that of Loewpro or Tamrac 5546. The quality is of an international standard.

Not a very Good DSLR Bag I bought this bag as soon as I saw the price. The prodcut is made up of good material with alot of packet and all blah blah blah but the only problem with the bag is that it has a very shallow and weak base. No padded support at the bottom will give you a heartache wenever you put it somewhere. Better carry in a polybag or a regular bag than this.

D3200 is a nice camera!!! Last week I bought Nikon D3200. It was like my dream fullfilled. After searching and reviewing tons of sites , I ended my search on D3200 as Camera and Flipkart as Seller. First of all I would tell you the future buyers or who have been using other cameras ( in this category ) that D3200 is much better camera than previous models like D3100 or D5100 or in Canon 550D.

People who compare this with 550D or D3100 / D5100 don't know that D3200 is the second best camera in sensor performance after Nikon 800. And its hardware features is being compared to Nikon Flagship Camera D800. Let me tell you why this camera is better than others. - Sensor of D3200 is second best sensor amongst all hi - end cameras. - Processor of D3200 is same as Nikon Flagship Camera D4 ( Reader can find it on Nikon site ) People ( all of us ) who claim that image quality and ISO sensitivity of D5100 is better than D3200 because they are just reading testing lab result , otherwise normal or expert user can't tell the distinguish be it D3100 / D3200 or 550D / 600D. I just started using this camera and have posted some pix on my facebook and flickr and I got really really good response. And above all , I would like to thanks "Flipkart Team" who helped me get my dream fulfilled. I got my camera before the committed time i.e. in less than 24 hr of my purchase order. ( except Sunday ) . I am giving this Camera 4 out 5 star because my hands are bigger and size of this camera is bit small for me. :) PS : This is unbiased feedback. I am praising D3200 not for that because I have bought it. I just wanted to buy latest launched camera. D3200 was launched in April 2012. Rest are almost 2 years old cameras. But still I love D3100 / D5100 / 550D / 660D , because all are same. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 74 of 82 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Ravi S. Nov 17 , 2012 D5100 vs. D3200 Here are a few reasons to go for the D5100 over the D3200 , for those who are undecided and just can't make up their minds : ( 1 ) Better low - light performance - with 16.2MPixels , the noise at high - ISO settings is better than the D3200 ( which provides 24MPixels on a marginally smaller sensor ) . The 24MPixels gives the D3200 a resolution of ~129 line - pairs / mm , while the 16.2 MPixels gives the D5100 a resolution of ~104 lp / mm. Even a high - end exotic lens will provide a maximum optical resolution of ~50 lp / mm , which means that the 104 lp / mm sensor of the D5100 already outresolves the lens. So… Here are a few reasons to go for the D5100 over the D3200 , for those who are undecided and just can't make up their minds : ( 1 ) Better low - light performance - with 16.2MPixels , the noise at high - ISO settings is better than the D3200 ( which provides 24MPixels on a marginally smaller sensor ) .

Even a high - end exotic lens will provide a maximum optical resolution of ~50 lp / mm , which means that the 104 lp / mm sensor of the D5100 already outresolves the lens. So go for the lower noise , better low light performing D5100. ( 2 ) Auto exposure and white balance bracketing : Believe it or not , the D3200 does not have an AE / WB bracketing option! The D5100 on the other hand allows auto - bracketing in 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 stop increments , and in addition , provides an in - camera HDR option ( which I rarely use , but there it is ) . ( 3 ) Active D - Lighting : More options in the D5100 ( Auto , High+ , High , Normal , Low ), i.e. more control for improving dynamic range , vs. ADL on / off in the D3200. ( 4 ) Less expensive : Save your money on the body and use it on the lenses - go for the 70 - 300mm / 55 - 300mm zoom , or the 50mm / 1.8G prime lens to complement the 18 - 55mm kit lens. ( 5 ) And of course , there's the flip - out screen in the D5100. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 51 of 59 users found this review helpful.

Autofocus Motor.. ( body AF motor lets you to auto focus with more lenses )--- 600D - Body AF motor D5100 - Lens Af motor D3200 - Lens Af motor 3. HDR mode.. ( it lets you get high image dynamic range even in backlight situations )--- D5100 has HDR mode , which is nice , but you can also do that with D3200 or 600D , later in any editing software.. 4. AF points.. ( helps to focus perfectly )--- 600D - 9 AF points. D5100 - 11 AF points. D3200 - 11 AF points. 5. Night shooting -- D3200 is simply better than others in this case , it has very low noise levels even in higher iso settings , trust me , this is amazing. 6. Colour depth and Image quality -- D3200 has much better colour depth , higher image quality , wide dynamic range than others in this case. 7. Sensor size -- D3200 and D5100 both have about 10% larger sensor than 600D 8. Battery life -- D5100 -- 660 shots D3200 -- 540 shots 600D -- 440 shots 9. Flip out screen.. ( good for video shooting )-- D5100 -- Yes 600D -- Yes D3200 -- No 10. Video quality -- all the cameras have Full HD 1080p video shooting mode , but D3200 has continous autofocus system in video mode , it is a very nice feature...on the other hand 600D has much more manual control on video shooting.. Finally I can recommend you to buy D3200 if you are really interested in still photography and also videography. I am sure this product will satisfy all your needs , but if you want much more control on video shooting you may consider buying 600D. ( but keep it on mind that D3200 is much better in image quality , color depth , night photography , dynamic range , image resolution than 600D ) . I am currently using Nikon D3200 , and trust me , you won't regret this buy.... Another thing is that if you are ready to pay about 10k more then you may buy Nikon D5200 , which is a really beautiful camera. D5200 has all the good features of these 3 cameras..

Even this you might get it for free. * External flash ( optional ) . The default flash is fair enough. If you're expecting good lighting effect for your indoor effect , you might need one. I bought "Nikon Speedlight SB - 400" and its worth. But again , its an optional one. I bought it in G.K Vale for ~37K ( tripod , uv filter , 4GB memory card , bag , lens cleaning set and 100 free photographs in g.k vale ) It was not available in flipkart that time but now it has with better price.

An Excellent camera for begineers I Bought this camera from flipkart before a year. I am using this for one year and found very much satisfactory about my choice. First this is a entry level DSLR camera and as amateur photographer you will find that 24 MP is quite useful. ( Really professionals dont care abt MP ) .It has a excellent censor which is similar to the one in D7000. When coming to performance of this camera as of i concerned there is no cons in this product. The kit lens comes along with product is more than sufficient to start a hobbyist in photographer or professional pro.If you shed some more money then opt for D52… I Bought this camera from flipkart before a year.

REVIEW - BEFORE & POST PURCHASE Ohhhh God... What a day it's been!

To start with , I'm a Nikon D3100 user , for the past couple months wanted to own a bigger one and have been researching a lot , an offer on 600D where you get a 18 - 55 and 55 - 250mm , was very tempting , but by the time I could make my mind up , the prices went high and could only get reviews about it from friends who already bought it ( they were definitely happy an… Ohhhh God... What a day it's been! I'm sure there are many buyers who get so many different suggestions from many people on what to buy and what not to , which would only get them even more confused just like I have been. To start with , I'm a Nikon D3100 user , for the past couple months wanted to own a bigger one and have been researching a lot , an offer on 600D where you get a 18 - 55 and 55 - 250mm , was very tempting , but by the time I could make my mind up , the prices went high and could only get reviews about it from friends who already bought it ( they were definitely happy and on a budget that is still a perfect buy ) . I then had shortlisted it to 600D , 650D and 60D , a friend of mine who is a professional photographer currently on a tour in Agra for a photo - shoot of Taj Mahal ( which is just amazing ) suggested me to get the 60D straight ( if possible with 18 - 200 ), another friend who runs a business of renting camera lenses in Bangalore told me that 60D has been in the market for a while now and rather get a "70D" which would be a great buy for me , but it was a big NO NO on the budget front. Finally today was the day , I had to purchase it , compared all my options and made my mind to go for the 60D. I have to say I am really happy about my decision for now , hopefully Flipkart and the seller ( WS Retail ) keep me just as happy as I am now! Purchased it for 45768 , expected delivery date is 9 days from now , but I guess they will deliver it to me before my travel date ( 16th May '14 ) . Can't wait to get my hands on it. I would really suggest any beginner or even an enthusiast to get a Canon 60D purely based on my research since the last 6 months and the pro's who suggested me this. Thank you for reading , more hands on review after receiving the item. Cheers!!! Continued - HANDS ON EXPERIENCE! Hello dear fellow flipkarters , I'm back , been out on a trip down south , and yes , I did take my brand new 60D out with me. I have to say , I do not have any hard thoughts about my decision , I enjoyed my clicks with a new height of features , this camera is definitely for me. As I'm not a pro but still an amateur , I can say , this camera with the LCD display on the top makes me stand out from the other DSLR users , being a semi - pro camera , the grip on it is perfect , the weight has been evenly proportioned and feels really good and powerful in hands , the looks are great , obviously all features are listed out in the specs and I'm not going to talk about it as this product does everything it has been designed to do so. On a whole , this camera will make you stand out and even a professional photographer would not complain much about it. At the end of the day , they are all good , but the question is , what is it in a DSLR , that you prefer? Happy clicking. Cheers!

Being my first DSLR I cant really say much in technical aspects as for that it will take sometime , for now these are my observations. Design : Ergonomically placed controls with a dial near shutter release button and a display array showing autofocus , drive modes , iso and metering , also a button to light it incase you are working on the viewfinder entirely. Next to LCD lies control wheel around SET button which can be assigned custom function , next to it there are the usual info and menu buttons. One thing I didnt like was delete button placed in the extreme left corner next to mode dial , something that should have been in the lower right extremity. and the mode dial needs unlocking by holding the middle button ( to prevent unintentional change in the shooting mode ) its flanked by ON / OFF switch Special mention about tilt and swivel LCD , extemely useful in shooting at unusual angles. Top lies hotshoe for external flash. Performance I am an avid high speed photography shooter , I found 5.3Fps amazingly fast , though it reduces while shooting in RAW. Pictures have really nice quality on par with the 7D which uses the same DIGIC 4 sensor. 9 cross type AF sensors in diamond shape see that no action is missed. Besides there is custom white balance , bracketing , picture modes , in camera RAW processing , creative filters. ISO and Shutter speed increments i1 / 3rd stops are a special mention.I couldnt test the video function as I never shoot any. Pros - Tilt and swivel LCD - good noise control at ISO 6400 - high shutterspeed for fast action ( 1 / 8000th ) & bulb mode - customizable settings ( most frequently used settings can be saved and used when needed without going through all steps again ) - sturdy feel , rubberized grip - cross check focus function ( Via digital zoom ) - excellent battery life and recharge time ( 1100 shots via view finder & 2hr 30 minutes for full battery recharge ) Cons - Kind of heavy at 755gms - image delete button inconveniently placed at top left extremity - sorely missing in camera crop I have on my Sony H50 - auto white balance sometimes favors warmer colors - AF slow in live view Conclusion - Best camera under 60 , 000 INR range with a host of features of the more expensive models yet in budget , though kinda bulky once in hands it does feel like a true DSLR , compared to others it has much better specifications and performance. Next ones would be D7000 from Nikon at 78 , 000 and 7D from Canon at 1 , 28 , 000 I suggest you keep another 10 , 000 for acessories ( lens / tripod / SDHC card , flash etc ) Just a note 4Gb SD card supplied in box is class 6 and not enough for a 18 megapixel DSLR.

Updating the rating from 2 stars to 5! *End of update* I received this camera a couple of days back. Was very happy until , I started taking some pictures and videos. There was a big red dot , visible in all the pictures and videos that I took. In the same point. I turned out to be a dust particle on the camera's sensor. Right out of the box. I was advised by my fellow photography enthusiasts to go into camera menu and select the manual clean option and leave the camera for 1 - 2 minutes. After cleaning , that red dot was gone. But then , as I started using the viewfinder , I noticed a couple of black spots on it. I cleaned the viewfinder glass , and the lens , but it didn't work. I then realized this was a case of dirt on the camera's mirror. Though these spots aren't visible in the photos. But I paid for a perfectly working product , and not a product full of dust particles right out of the box. Then , I noticed a small black dot on the LCD of the camera , that spot , turned out to be another dust particle. This time inside the LCD. Which , obviously , no one can clean. So I finally ordered for a replacement unit. Will update the review as soon as I receive it. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 4 users found this review helpful.

I got the camera for 40 , 307 /- with EF - S 18 - 55mm IS II kit lens and a 8Gb SD Card ( which is a class 10 and have fast writing speed ), but as of now it can be purchased anywhere between 42 , 000 /- to 49 , 000 /- retail price ( lower limits found at online retailers and higher limit for canon showrooms and retail shops ) .

At this price it is an amazing camera to have. Specifications can easily be seen in description. Here I will share my reason for choosing this model. Primary focus was getting an all round performing camera in the cheapest price as I was a little tight in cash 60D has been a stellar DSLR of canon line up. It is an intelligent amalgamation of semi - pro and entry level camera. It is swift in auto focus performance ( which is better as compared to all the similarly priced DSLRs in the market ), great image quality and video. Has bigger rugged and heavier body with nice grip compared to similarly priced DLSRs. For me 60D has better feel and easy operation. I simply love the twin dials on this body and tilt and swivel screen is great as I usually keep it in closed position even during taking pictures which prevents it from taking up facial oil marks and scratches. Most of the camera setting can be changed using direct buttons on body and important info is seen on top LDC. Back screen comes in use only for video and menu operations and going through various images taken and in camera processing. This saves lot of battery which any how is plenty to take around 1200 snaps. View finder is clear and big pentaprism. One star is deducted only because now you may have a better successor in Canon EOS 70D ( Although it is good 35K more heavy on the pocket ) . Although it is an old camera ( launched in Sept 2010 ), it must be noted that it still shares the same sensor ( 18mp APS - C CMOS ) as that of newly launched Canon 700D and 100D with these model having a higher image processor which takes their ISO at higher 25 , 000 ( Highest ) compered to 12500 ( Highest ) of 60D ( which is one stop ) but then these models are expensive by 15000 /- and 10000 /- respectively. At this bargain of price we get a semi - pro body as compared to entry level and 700D and 100D which means that camera have better buffer which you will see when taking multiple action shots in a go and all important setting have direct access button and two wheels depending on the mode you are in which makes camera operation that bit quicker. Camera also have higher shutter speed compared to those two models and focus speed is amazing without too much of a hunt even with 18 - 55mm kit lens which only will get better as you get better and fast lens to camera. Only 7D and 70D ( from Canon ) and D7100 ( from Nikon ) are a better APS - C sensor DSLR camera in every respect but then they have hefty price tag for that. As with its Nikon rivals D5200 , D7000 and D5300 come close. D7000 is more of direct competition to 60D but is more expensive , where D7000 as many reviewer says is maybe a touch better at still photography ( which even if it is , is so little that most of us wont be able to tell by just looking at images out of the two ) but is beaten hands down in video. I thought it is a better option to have more versatile camera at hand. For me 60D is overall better than D5200 as again it has much more to offer than D5200 at similar price ( which is obvious as one is semi - pro body while other is entry level ) . D5300 is again expensive by 15k. If you have a tight budget on close to 45k , in my view this is the camera to own. This is more bulky and heavy camera though compared to 600D , 700D , 100D , D5200 and D5300 which may be a negative for many. For those who want bit light and less bulky camera entry level DSLR with following are the suggestions If you have even low budget you may consider Canon 600D and Nikon D3200 , or even new Canon 1200D. If you want at similar budget you may look at Nikon D5200 , If you can stretch of course you can look for other newer option from Canon ( 100D and 700D ) and Nikon ( D5300 ) . Both Canon and Nikon have great history in optical imaging products and digital imaging products make high quality cameras. Believe me its just a matter of personal satisfaction rather than anything else for a newbie , amateur and enthusiast alike in what camera to own. Both make cameras with which you can never go wrong.

Fourth , extremely easy to use ; one can use the automatic settings ( which is just tooooo good for amateurs ) or manual settings , aperture settings are also available.

With 55 - 200 lens i need to place the cam horizontal. it only takes body with 55 - 200 and no space for other things or 35mm lens as the cam is horizontal touching all sides except top. The bag is a 10 / 10 bag with very good padding and the best part the plastic clip. i need not zip the bag to keep the cam in. clip holds well. withstand a 2 month overseas trip with no sigh of wear and tear. good if you dont have 55 - 200 or any other bag. this is my outing bag. a perfect for all typs of bumps where i need to travel light. small to fit in a bigger travel bag / backpack if needed. ( of course this depends upon the size of your other bags. mine were a bit bigger than usual. ) I tried the older cousin adventura 160 also but thats too big. Thats a good option if you are planning to have only one bag. As people say you will need at least two bags with a DSLR. one to keep every thing at one place and one to carry just the cam when you are not in the mood switch lenses. this one is perfect for the 2nd carry type.

It would have been ideal , if the upper compartment would have been larger by 50%. you will be amazed how your camera feels light , when you are carrying it back inside it. I'm flattered by the design and bulit quality. and you'll slowly discover how useful the small to smallest feature it consists of. Flipkart delivery as fast as it is all the time.

Not Very Useful I bought the bag reading the reviews. The fabric quality was exceptionally good but the sack that we put the camera and accessories was very confined and not so useful , which makes no sense in buying a special camera bag. Once we put the camera and one lens in , it is not very easy to take out the camera as the sides succumb it. I have a Sony SLT A - 37 ( which is ot really big in size ) and a 75 - 300 lens , which does not fit freely. I had to pay 4k for this. So please take this into consideration while buying. I am now putting my camera on the front opening of the bag. cheers Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 1 users found this review helpful.

The reason is , I ordered this camera just because there was an 8GB SD card on offer. But when i got the actual product , it was packaged with a 4GB SD card. When enquired with flipcart customer care , I was told that the offer ( 8GB SD ) was from Thursday ( 11 - 09 - 2014 ) onwards. But i am 200% sure that when i placed the order , it was displayed with 8GB card on offer from 10 - 09 - 2014 onwards. To be honest , you have put a very bad taste in my mouth. I didnt expect this kind of response from a company like flipkart. Unfortunately i dont have any proof to show that the 8GB offer was there from 10 - 09 - 2014 onwards. But as a customer , I am very disappointed I don't want to lie here as i know that what ever i said is 100% accurate.

Prices vary for camera color , with silver color ones normally the cheapest. 11. There is a separate video recording button , which starts immediately on clicking it. No in between pausing of video recording possible. So each time you have to stop and so new file will get created. 12. Has a wifi kind of icon displayed on screen. But has no wifi connectivity.

This is the worst camera. Please dont buy this camera. Even if someone is giving this cam for free pls dont get it. The shutter speed is too slow ( like ages ) . Time taken between shots is long. Auto focus is poor. Not many options for scene mode. Its too tiny to hold it properly and slips off your hand. Blurred images.Shaky images. Poor in low light. Microphone doesn't capture much audio.

Most versatile lens , ever! I used this lens most of the time. the most important point is the ability to zoom 18 - 200mm , an enormous upgrade from a kitlens , which is only 18 - 55. like kitlens , you can use this lens for any condition. landscape , potrait , telephoto , and even macro. of course , the image cannot be compared to specialized lenses like ultra wide or 400mm , but the versatility is what counts. and it's very light also. for around Rs15000 or so , this lens is perfect as the first lens you buy after kitlens.

I bought this lens after my stock lens ( Canon 18 - 55mm f / 3.5 - 5.6 ) broke. I have been using this lens for quite a while now and I am pretty satisfied with the images and their qualities on a 6.3Mp Canon EOS Digital Rebel. I've taken this lens to many places I have visited and it has coped up well. The disadvantages ( as per me ) of this lens are : 1 ) Changing focal lengths is quite a hard task as the rotating barrel is not easy to rotate. 2 ) The AutoFocus mechanism of this lens is quite noisy. It ruins the moment of the photograph. 3 ) The lens is quite heavy for a standard zoom lens… I bought this lens after my stock lens ( Canon 18 - 55mm f / 3.5 - 5.6 ) broke.

It ruins the moment of the photograph. 3 ) The lens is quite heavy for a standard zoom lens. If you wear a neck strap and have this lens on , you will probably die of strain as all the weight is put over the neck. 4 ) If the lock provided in the lens isn't on , then the lens easily opens up , which could result to damage. The advantages of having this lens are : 1 ) There is no need to carry around multiple lenses as this serves as the stock as well as a macro lens. 2 ) The 'lock' function available on this lens helps to prevent the lens to open itself while putting the camera in the cover. 3 ) This lens is good for bokeh as well! 4 ) The build quality is impressive. 5 ) Mount supports EOS - L so you can mount this lens on the budget cameras and even on the professional DSLRs like the 5DM2 , 5DM3 , 1DsM4. Go ahead. Buy this product. This really is a wonderful lens. And priced at such a rate , this wont even make your pockets feel empty. You could rather buy this lens and the Canon 50mm f / 1.8 II and still save some money instead of buying the Sigma 18 - 200mm DC II OS...

Id appreciate if flipkart thoroughly checks such fragile and expensive product before dispatching. P.S. Wen I got such a cold response from the service center , I decided to clean the lens on my own. The overall cost for cleaning was 50 RUPEES only. Believe it. I just got myself a set of screwdrivers for that amount. The lens is perfect now. The bokeh , zoom , over all feel and image quality at full zoom is too good for that price. I recommend any novice or amateur photographer to have this lens along with the 18 - 55 stock offcourse and a 50mm on his cam gear.

Sure its heavy , zooming in seems a bit tight , but picture quality is very good. Extra zoom is awesome if you are using it for the first time. However , in low light , you need a tripod or extra steady hands to take indoor pictures as well. Just got it yesterday so still trying to figure things out.

Top compartment can hold lots of small stuff like batteries , chargers , cables etc. The main compartment can hold a DSLR body , a tele lens , a couple of primes , a kit lens and an external flash. Small zipper compartments on the outside can hold a couple of filters. There is a compartment just behind ones back , on the top , that easily fits my 7 inch tablet. Very spacious. I would give five starts for space. Quality of the fabric used to make the bag is pretty decent and rugged. Cons : Zippers are not of the best quality. Needs a little tugging to get them around. Just a minor hiccup. The inner ( main ) compartment has some kind of felt - cloth like lining. A little of the fine lint ( fine cotton ) is sticking to the rubber grip of the body when taken out. May happen with any other rubberized stuff we put in there. The compartment separators have the male part of the velcro , but there is no velcro lining on the inside of the main compartment. What was flipkart thinking here? The velcro barely manages to stick to the felt - like lining on the inside. Mind you , BARELY MANAGES to. Not a very huge concern if the compartment is filled with gear though , as the stuff inside will then be closely packed without moving around much. Bottomline : Beginners : This is an OK deal , considering the price. A camera backpack from any other brand is priced higher and would be smaller too. This would do the job just right , to get rid of the messenger bag you get along with the DSLR kit. Pro’s : What are you even doing on this page??

Now about the capacity , I was able to pack everything ( except the tripod , for obvious reasons ) inside the bottom main compartment , and the top is free to keep some other materials. Let me now go to rate this product : 1. Space : 5* , nothing can be said about this , I have still space left. 2. Build Quality : 4.5* , padding is good , in the inside also the had provided velcro , both male & female is available , the female part is provided all around , so as to customize the inside ( unlike reported earlier , and this is a welcome change ) . Stitching and zip quality is ok , that's why I am not giving it 5*. 3. Ergonomics : 4* , the straps are just ok , even any laptop carrying backpacks are having much better straps. also to take the camera out from the bag while on the move , one needs to place the bag on something , and then open the zip for the compartment. Again considering the price , a 4* can surely be awarded. 4. Looks : 5* , I would give it a 5* , just because it looks so backpack type that none would think that it may contain camera , while travelling in a public transport. This may vary from person to person. Cons : 1. a bit heavy 2. taking out a camera on the go Overall verdict : 1. Considering the price of the product , at sub 1500 /- level , this bag surely deserves a 5* rating. Though I have omitted the durability aspect for obvious reasons ( I got this bag just in my hand , and if it fails to last long , I shall change this rating accordingly ) . 2. Last but not the least , the flipkart delivery , I ordered this product yesterday in the forenoon , and was delivered at my doorstep today afternoon , a truly 7* performance.

However the bag is decent for the price - a value for money and with lots of space that you carry as a back - pack. The top compartment - that has a separate zip from the lower one - is where I can keep anything else ( towel , cap - anything that carries my stuff and also acts like a cushion ) . Overall - A good buy. What I like the most - The delivery time and packaging of Flipkart. Their service is unmatched and outstanding almost always.

I have packed everything into it and I find i can still add another couple of lens into the bag easily. I find the professional camera bag of this size costing around 8000 - 9000. The form backing is also good and offers a excellent protection to the gear. Thus looking at the price point this one has a huge cost advantage. There are few disadvantages 1. The bag is slightly heavy. And putting in all ur gear is going to make it more heavier. 2. The zipper quality is on the low side. 3. At some places the finish is not that good. Any way for 1250 Rs its difficult to expect everything. In short this is a good buy. I would be happy if Digiflip comes out with a camera bag which can accommodate a 15 inch laptop and a charger. U always need to carry ur laptop when u go for tour and trek. carrying two separate bags for a laptop and camera makes it more uncomfortable. Just a recommendation.

Customizability : You can shoot in multiple resolutions , multiple sizes and in JPEG / NEF formats. It has the standard nikon variety of white balances and picture tones , but setting anything is extremely simple once you get a hold of your camera. Ergonomics : It fits your hand nicely , unlike the D5100 and D3100. Really rock solid , and you immediately get the feel that you're ready for the shoot. The two dials ( one for aperture and another for shutter ) is much MUCH better than having just one dial as D5100 , or any Canon in this range. Low light performance : Pretty decent. I usually go up to ISO 1600 when I'm in low light , and the pics that come out are usually good enough , with very less graininess. Battery : Extremely reliable and long lasting. Doesn't take a long time to recharge , and takes about 1000 shots ( if you don't use flash ) . Autofocus : YES! Which is another big differentiator in the low end cameras like D5100 and D90. The camera itself has an autofocus motor , and it's compatible with all lenses. On a D90. you don't need to buy expensive lenses with AF motor , just because your camera body sucks. Included Software : Horrible :) Just use Adobe lightroom or Aperture , and you'll be good. Included Kit lens : 18 - 105 is a very versatile lens and extremely reliable too. It covers most of the range that you're likely to encounter. Also , the autofocus on this is very silent. Video : Pretty basic. No autofocus makes it useless for me , really. Even the most basic camcorder is better than a D90 when it comes to video. Overall - 4 / 5 , mostly because of useless video functionality and due to the fact that D7000 tops D90 in all departments.

Pictures look blotchy and not sharp , specially at night photography on those cameras. I bought D90 even though some newer models were available at that point of time. The reason behind that was its great handling. If you want to take photography seriously and upgrade your camera later on , D90 provides you the same features that other pro cameras offer , including buttons and others features which are essentially same. 12 megapixels are good enough for me , and in daylight the camera is a marvel ( I compared my prints with my friends who owns a 5DMII and daylight pics are at par ) . But the camera pic suffers at night , due to low ISO tolerance. Obviously adding a big aperture lens improves the quality drastically ( I use one f - 1.4 50 mm prime for night ), and adding an external flash can really help you out. Focus speed is not the fastest , but does not matter as long as you do not shoot sports. Weight and ergonomics of the camera is just awesome ( an essential for a DSLR , as users know it , a bad ergonomically designed camera weighing more than 1 kg can really hurt your hands for sure ) . ISO range till 1000 is ok , after that noise is very obvious. Camera features some basic post - processing features , but nobody uses it. 12 bit compressed RAW is a impressive feature and every serious photographers should learn how to use RAW photographs. In built flash is just not good , you need to buy an external flash. VR lenses work fine with this camera ( some camera in Nikon lineup has this problem ) . Best photos can be taken ( according to me ) in landscape photography and in abstract photography. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 2 of 2 users found this review helpful.

Excellent camera , full of features which you can expect from a high end SLR but almost half the price. I found 18 - 105mm lens to be bit softer but still its a great lens. I use it for mostly outdoor shootings and this camera is very reliable in all respects. A good buy for many years to come I guess.

One thing i should mention is that this camera has two main functions that i find to be really useful. this camera has a bigger body compared to the D3200 and the D5200 so if you have huge hands like me then its much more easier to hold and if it still isnt comfortable enough you can buy a battery grip. its really useful and the camera just feels really solid. second , this camera supports autofocus on the body. this allows you to use old lenses which do not have an built in autofocus motor. third. the camera has two separate dials that allow you to use one for aperture and the other one for shutter speed. i found this to be much more useful and comfortable than having to press a button and then scrolling to change the settings as found on the other cameras. few points you want to keep in mind before purchasing one ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 2 users found this review helpful.

I did a lot of research before I decided to go for the D3200.

Autofocus Motor.. ( body AF motor lets you to auto focus with more lenses )--- 600D - Body AF motor D5100 - Lens Af motor D3200 - Lens Af motor 3. HDR mode.. ( it lets you get high image dynamic range even in backlight situations )--- D5100 has HDR mode , which is nice , but you can also do that with D3200 or 600D , later in any editing software.. 4. AF points.. ( helps to focus perfectly )--- 600D - 9 AF points. D5100 - 11 AF points. D3200 - 11 AF points. 5. Night shooting -- D3200 is simply better than others in this case , it has very low noise levels even in higher iso settings , trust me , this is amazing. 6. Colour depth and Image quality -- D3200 has much better colour depth , higher image quality , wide dynamic range than others in this case. 7. Sensor size -- D3200 and D5100 both have about 10% larger sensor than 600D 8. Battery life -- D5100 -- 660 shots D3200 -- 540 shots 600D -- 440 shots 9. Flip out screen.. ( good for video shooting )-- D5100 -- Yes 600D -- Yes D3200 -- No 10. Video quality -- all the cameras have Full HD 1080p video shooting mode , but D3200 has continous autofocus system in video mode , it is a very nice feature...on the other hand 600D has much more manual control on video shooting.. Finally I can recommend you to buy D3200 if you are really interested in still photography and also videography. I am sure this product will satisfy all your needs , but if you want much more control on video shooting you may consider buying 600D. ( but keep it on mind that D3200 is much better in image quality , color depth , night photography , dynamic range , image resolution than 600D ) . I am currently using Nikon D3200 , and trust me , you won't regret this buy.... Another thing is that if you are ready to pay about 10k more then you may buy Nikon D5200 , which is a really beautiful camera. D5200 has all the good features of these 3 cameras..

From me 4 star for this kit instead of 5 as delivered 1 day late then committed. overall experience with flipkart is great. packing was really appreciable.

This is my first DSLR after my Vivitar V3800N 35mm SLR that I owned about 6 years ago , so my review here might sound like a bunch of antiquated thoughts from a genie out of a bottle after 6 years. Though Autofocus and the other things amaze me , I still find shooting in manual mode better than letting the electronics in the camera decide the settings for me. Maybe its because I have used only manual film slrs before , I don't know. I filled up my 16 GB memory card and the battery was only 50% empty. That looks good , I don't have to carry a spare battery when I go on long drives. The proximity sensor on the LCD comes back on when I press the shutter half way to autofocus and release it before pressing full , and thats a little annoying when the light is low. I used to be able to view the full frame on the view finder on my Vivitar with my glasses on , but on this , the corners are being cut unless I bring my eye really close to the viewfinder. The mirror adjustment tampers with focus and since I shoot in manual , that isn't helping much. The VR feature works only while you're photographing wild life from a moving jeep or something. Turning VR on doesn't help minor shakes at low shutter speeds. Get a tripod. The Nikon 3200 is cheaper than the D90 , has more resolution , but you can't mount all those flashy high aperture long zoon lenses on it. Well , Im not going to be shooting out drag races anytime soon. With the 18 - 105 lens that comes with this camera , and the additional Sigma 70 - 300 mm macro lens that I have ordered , which I expect to be delivered today , and a circular polarizer , the tripod and the remote that I already have , I guess I have the complete amateur kit , all set to register memories of my trips to enjoy later in life.

Its predecessor , the D3100 , offered a pixel count of 14.2 - million pixels and standard ISO sensitivities of ISO 100–3200.

For people new to photography or someone who would buy this as an upgrade from basic slrs - i would say get the kit lens , if you already have a 18 - 55 get the body only...get a 50mm 1.8 d with this one which is quite cheap ... you would then have both wide angle and potrait covered...if you want amazing night results ..make sure u get a tripod and a remote trigger with this one ( the 50 mm +tripod +remote = Rs 7500 roughly ) .That is a better way to spend money and learn the craft.

An advanced level of equipment for serious amateurs I have been doing amateur photography for last couple of years. I was using Olympus 4 / 3 system ( E620 ) for last four years. But lack of service centers and quality in India made me move out of the brand Olympus. And as usual I was confused to choose between Canon and Nikon. Recent price hike of Canon lenses made the lens price comparable between the two giants. And feasibility of using old SLR lenses directly in the body made me lean towards Nikon. Still the contender was Canon 60D and Nikon D5200 ( with a wish to get D7000 ) . I am not a fan of taking video using camera ( don't like handycams too ) … I have been doing amateur photography for last couple of years. I was using Olympus 4 / 3 system ( E620 ) for last four years. But lack of service centers and quality in India made me move out of the brand Olympus. And as usual I was confused to choose between Canon and Nikon. Recent price hike of Canon lenses made the lens price comparable between the two giants. And feasibility of using old SLR lenses directly in the body made me lean towards Nikon. Still the contender was Canon 60D and Nikon D5200 ( with a wish to get D7000 ) . I am not a fan of taking video using camera ( don't like handycams too ) so the performance of video was out of my preference points. For 60D it was the articulated display , price vs performance ( being a semi - pro of a time ) and for D5200 it was the latest AF system and Nikon's ISO performance. However opted for D7000 with little more than that of 60D's regular price. D7100 was out in the market then , but the price difference does not justifies the need. Moving from a 4 / 3 system , I was overwhelmed with AF lock performance , ISO , DOF factor , and number of lenses that I can opt for ( used and new ) . I am not expert enough to present differences with digits and numbers , but its fun to use this camera. I miss the super menu UI of Olympus , but with direct access buttons and top LCD viewer made the task of changing settings easy. Though the camera is towards heavier side compared to a 4 / 3 system or other entry level dSLRs , it strikes a perfect balance with 18 - 105 Nikkor lens and I can carry it around my neck without much trouble , but a sling strap will help a lot to distribute the weight around your shoulder than on your neck. The 18 - 105 lens is excellent and it has a good balance between size and reach for a kit lens. And it is sharp enough for an amateur to choose not to opt for more advanced general zoom lens. There are a lot of advanced settings that I have not tried , and most probably wont use also , but some basic settings I have done and love them , like auto ISO , WB settings , picture control for saturation - contrast and use of U1 and U2 mode. Backed with 2 slot for memory card , I don't have to switch between cards when one is full. A large view finder ( compared to my old one ) helps me to compose the frame better. Image Quality is superb with high ISO performance. Now I can go up to ISO3200 with usable quality photos. In 6400 noise it too much unless the frame is filled with less mid - tone and more of full blacks and bright highlights. Color reproduction is natural for most of the WB settings that is set by camera automatically. Overall I am very happy with this camera - excellent.

Excellent DSLR I've started using the camera from day one. I was quite astonished by the quality of image from the camera. This camera is very user friendly and flexible to use. I highly recommend this DSLR for an enthusiast. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Ankit Banerjee May 5 , 2012 Good , but... After using both the Canon 60d and Nikon D7000 for about 2 weeks each , I must admit , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two. Similarly priced with a difference of about 4k with the Canon 60D and 18 - 135 IS lens , and a similar specs sheet. Ergonomically feels the same as well. But , it is worth noting , that the D7000 does have a few flaws , compared to the Canon 60D. 1. The 60D has an articulated screen. Simply , it can tilt and swivel , much like a handycam.

Similarly priced with a difference of about 4k with the Canon 60D and 18 - 135 IS lens , and a similar specs sheet. Ergonomically feels the same as well. But , it is worth noting , that the D7000 does have a few flaws , compared to the Canon 60D. 1. The 60D has an articulated screen. Simply , it can tilt and swivel , much like a handycam. Also , I felt that the 60D had a slightly brighter screen as well , and the screen has a higher resolution - 1 , 040k dots vs 920k in the D7000. So , if you're into a lot of experimental and creative photography , the 60D clearly beats the D7000 is that aspect. The tilt - y screen does come is handy. 2. The Nikon d7000 oddly drained its battery a lot faster than the 60D! Even though , the specs sheet given by Nikon says it can pump about 1000 shots in a single charge , it doesn't give more than 800 , in ideal conditions - with VR switched off in the lens , no use of flash , and minimal change in settings. The canon never fails to deliver anything below 1100 shots. More on this - the canon does switch on after getting off , so , you can manage about 20 clicks after that! but , Nikon , sadly , doesn't. 3. Video Quality. We know it. You know it. Canon will forever beat Nikon in this segment. The continuous Autofocus somehow seems a little inefficient. Though i didn't really get much time to test the video mode much , but , take my word , search up Youtube - Canon 60D delivers a way more warmer and richer Video , than the D7000. Period. 4. For those who suck on megapixels , the 60D has 18 MP , while the D7000 is 16.1 MP. I wouldn't say it necessarily makes a difference , but , when it comes to using wide angle lens , or when you don't have a good telephoto lens , those extra MPs do help in delivering more detail. Nikon fans argue that the higher MP count in canon is the reason for lower image quality , specially a lot noise at higher ISO. Well , I'd suggest you try either the 550D or the 60D at a 12 or 14 MP resolution , lowering it in the camera , trust me , in my old 550D , i got results which rival the Nikon d90 and even the d7000. 5. Even though the Nikon D7000 delivers excellent image quality , beyond all doubts , it still think , its not the same..err..type as the 60D. As in , the Canon delivers images which have a different warmth factor in them. And , to be honest , it somehow matches with most street / abstract / landscape scenes in India. The warmth and the colour tones delivered by the Canon , with identical settings , just seem to compliment the Indian eye better. Ask a friend to click two photos with the same scene , with both the cameras and look at them without knowing which belongs to which. 7 / 10 times , you'll prefer canon. It might just be my personal experience / feeling , but , somehow canon seems more suited to Indian photography , where most photographs have a sort of dry and warm feel. Nikon never really has tried to improve on this , and hence keeps competing with themselves. Both the 60D and D7000 are excellent cameras. If you a want to be serious about what you buy , i'd suggest renting them for a day / getting it from a friend and choosing for your preference. Mind you , the d7000 is a tad costlier , but offers you a slightly ( 5.3 vs 6fps ) higher burst rate and a stop more if ISO ( upto 25600 ) . Think and buy. happy clicking. Cheers.

Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

Just tilt the screen and you'll be smiling for the comfort you'll be getting with this feature. With an extra zoom button on the left gives you that extra 'grippie' control over the zoom feature. And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

Decent lens for folks on a tight budget. I bought this lens from Flipkart for my D90 about 5 months ago and have been using it intermittently. First , the autofocus with the D90 internal motor is good in daylight. Towards late evening if you try to take a picture of a crow on a nearby tree , the autofocus simply hunts.

As there is no VR , you essentially get what you paid for. Without tripod and below 1 / 300th of a sec shutter speed , the pictures clicked with even the slightest of camerashake are as as good as worthless. Moreover the glass is not ED as compared to the 5 times more expensive 70 - 300 VR ED lens. Coming back to the lens under review , at 70~180mm ( this lens gives a 35mm equivalent of 105mm ~ 450mm on the D90 ) you get decently sharp pictures. Beyond 200 mm , you'll get sharp pictures may be at arounf f8~f11 but you'll have to bump up the ISO which inturn increase the noise. You can use the pics but with some post processing in LR. All in all a cheap lens from Nikon to produce cheap looking photographs. I find the lens to be a better portrait lens than a long telephoto. You can see some sample pics in azon for this lens and compare with the pics taken by the VR version. All in all its a good lens to own for a beginner on a budget. However if you are a beginner and have the dough , you are better of going in for a 70~300 VR ED ( 67 mm filter size ) or a comparatively cheaper 55~300 DX in you own a DX size camera ( much lesser filter size so amount of light entering is also less :( ... ) Or you may go for the sigma or tamron lens which come with the macro option ( no VR still ) at a slightly more expense than this lens. Hope this review helps. On a lighter note , after reading my review if you still want to go ahead and buy this lens , tell me i'll sell mine for cheap : D : D As usual , kudos to flipkart for the next day delivery even if they promise 4 business days.

Purchased this lens for my Nikon D3200 after thorough search from different sources. I was aware of majority of cons. So I was expecting a very bad bad lens. But , I took the risk of purchasing this lens and I'm one HAPPY CUSTOMER. Behind the scene : This Person was using his 18 - 55 for nearly all purpose. The itch started to upgrade. The nearest competitor was Tamron 70 - 300mm which has a very high rating. In Nikon , its counter part with VR costs in the tune of 20k , which this person and his wife objected to.

The itch started to upgrade. The nearest competitor was Tamron 70 - 300mm which has a very high rating. In Nikon , its counter part with VR costs in the tune of 20k , which this person and his wife objected to. CONS of this lens : - NO VR. Need a steady hands above 200mm and slow shutter speeds. Better buy a tripod or find some place to keep the camera. Also , use a shutter release cable / remote. - No auto focus function with my camera. ( D3200 ) . Since the body doesn't have inbuilt motor , the auto focus is not supported. - As the light diminishes , the quality of the images diminishes. they are directly proportional. - Need good eyes because of its total MF function. - Picture is soft after 200mm. PROS of this lens. : - Very good results in proper day light. - Very good lens for portraits. Bokeh is worth appreciating. - In taking photos of birds or animals , if properly focused , the results are amazing and sharp until 200mm. Hence no issues in that segment. Ill be rating this lens a well deserved 4 / 5 , because , you get what you pay for. This lens is my preferred lens for portraits over my 18 - 55mm. But beware , in low end Nikon DSLR bodies without built in motor , it will be a pain to focus and without VR in low lights , it will be another problem. But , overall If you ask me whether I'm Happy , Ill reply 'hell YES. I got more than I expected for.' - ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 4 of 4 users found this review helpful.

Nikon AF Zoom - Nikkor 70 - 300 mm f / 4 - 5.6G ( 4.3x ) Lens Its a great mod range zoom lems for a very affordable proce. Great for beginners in serious photography and photography enthousiasts. However I would not rate the lens as a professional class equipment because I feel the quality of output could improve further , nevertheless its good for the proice you pay for the lens. When zooming out full range please use a tripod t avoid image stability errors. Goes will with the Nikon D5100. Its a great second lens. For enthusiasts I would recommend 18 / 55 , 18 / 105 and a 70 / 300. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

I bought this lens in 2011 and I'm writing this review as a tribute to this lens! This is my first telephoto and I'm very more than happy with this lens. I also perfected my manual focus skills with this lens. This lens performs really well in bright outdoors and also in properly illuminated indoors. Since the aperture range starts at 4 and at 300mm it is 5.6 , light would always be an issue.

It has been a continuous performer. Talking about the build quality , it is quite decent and you don't find a lot of chromatic aberrations. The optics is quite good considering its price. This is not an AF - S. So for those DSLRs with no AF motors would have to focus it manually. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 3 users found this review helpful.

If you are looking for a good zoom lens and have a budget constrains , Go for this one for sure. The images are sharp and crisp till about 200mm and a little soft with full zoom. Please note this lens does have VR feature so in low light the images might have shakes in case you don't have a steady hand ( or use a tripod ) . Flipkart did delay delivering this product but they informed me about the additional time they will take , but who cares about that , when you finally get it in your hand. And it is all Black!! ( I was secretly praying for it!! ) Good product , a good price. I recommend. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 4 of 5 users found this review helpful.

I bought this lens sometime back to go with my Nikon D3100. Though Flipkart delivered the item in good time , and am happy with the service of Flipkart , I am far from satisfied with the product itself. First of all , if one has to use this lens one has to have steady hands like an expert marksman. It is practically impossible to shoot good quality pictures with this lens - even with a tripod. At 70 mm perhaps one can get a decent shot. Since it doesn't have auto focus , it is useless in most cases , especially if the subject is moving. Shame on Nikon to market such a lens.

It has put this product in the market just to cause damage to other auto focus lens manufacturers in this range. I would never recommend this lens to anyone who is interested in good photography.

Top compartment can hold lots of small stuff like batteries , chargers , cables etc. The main compartment can hold a DSLR body , a tele lens , a couple of primes , a kit lens and an external flash. Small zipper compartments on the outside can hold a couple of filters. There is a compartment just behind ones back , on the top , that easily fits my 7 inch tablet. Very spacious. I would give five starts for space. Quality of the fabric used to make the bag is pretty decent and rugged. Cons : Zippers are not of the best quality. Needs a little tugging to get them around. Just a minor hiccup. The inner ( main ) compartment has some kind of felt - cloth like lining. A little of the fine lint ( fine cotton ) is sticking to the rubber grip of the body when taken out. May happen with any other rubberized stuff we put in there. The compartment separators have the male part of the velcro , but there is no velcro lining on the inside of the main compartment. What was flipkart thinking here? The velcro barely manages to stick to the felt - like lining on the inside. Mind you , BARELY MANAGES to. Not a very huge concern if the compartment is filled with gear though , as the stuff inside will then be closely packed without moving around much. Bottomline : Beginners : This is an OK deal , considering the price. A camera backpack from any other brand is priced higher and would be smaller too. This would do the job just right , to get rid of the messenger bag you get along with the DSLR kit. Pro’s : What are you even doing on this page??

Let me tell my gears first just to get an idea about its capacity. 1. Nikon D - 3000 2. Nikon F - 80 3. Nikon AF - S DX Nikkor 18 - 55 mm f / 3.5 - 5.6G VR 4. Nikon AF - S DX Nikkor 55 - 300 mm f / 4.5 - 5.6G ED VR 5. Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f / 1.8D 6. Nikon AF Nikkor 28 - 105 f / 3.5 - 4.5D 7. Few filters ( inc. C - Pl , Vari ND , G - ND , UV , Skylight ) 8. Extra Cell for both the cameras 9. Cables , remote shutter release , and other accessories , includes few rolls of film 10. A tripod. Now about the capacity , I was able to pack everything ( except the tripod , for obvious reasons ) inside the bottom main compartment , and the top is free to keep some other materials. Let me now go to rate this product : 1. Space : 5* , nothing can be said about this , I have still space left. 2. Build Quality : 4.5* , padding is good , in the inside also the had provided velcro , both male & female is available , the female part is provided all around , so as to customize the inside ( unlike reported earlier , and this is a welcome change ) . Stitching and zip quality is ok , that's why I am not giving it 5*. 3. Ergonomics : 4* , the straps are just ok , even any laptop carrying backpacks are having much better straps. also to take the camera out from the bag while on the move , one needs to place the bag on something , and then open the zip for the compartment. Again considering the price , a 4* can surely be awarded. 4. Looks : 5* , I would give it a 5* , just because it looks so backpack type that none would think that it may contain camera , while travelling in a public transport. This may vary from person to person. Cons : 1. a bit heavy 2. taking out a camera on the go Overall verdict : 1. Considering the price of the product , at sub 1500 /- level , this bag surely deserves a 5* rating. Though I have omitted the durability aspect for obvious reasons ( I got this bag just in my hand , and if it fails to last long , I shall change this rating accordingly ) . 2. Last but not the least , the flipkart delivery , I ordered this product yesterday in the forenoon , and was delivered at my doorstep today afternoon , a truly 7* performance.

However the bag is decent for the price - a value for money and with lots of space that you carry as a back - pack. The top compartment - that has a separate zip from the lower one - is where I can keep anything else ( towel , cap - anything that carries my stuff and also acts like a cushion ) . Overall - A good buy. What I like the most - The delivery time and packaging of Flipkart. Their service is unmatched and outstanding almost always.

I have packed everything into it and I find i can still add another couple of lens into the bag easily. I find the professional camera bag of this size costing around 8000 - 9000. The form backing is also good and offers a excellent protection to the gear. Thus looking at the price point this one has a huge cost advantage. There are few disadvantages 1. The bag is slightly heavy. And putting in all ur gear is going to make it more heavier. 2. The zipper quality is on the low side. 3. At some places the finish is not that good. Any way for 1250 Rs its difficult to expect everything. In short this is a good buy. I would be happy if Digiflip comes out with a camera bag which can accommodate a 15 inch laptop and a charger. U always need to carry ur laptop when u go for tour and trek. carrying two separate bags for a laptop and camera makes it more uncomfortable. Just a recommendation.

The D3300 is the camera to get. Paying more won't get you much more other than a lot more weight to have to carry around. • The built - in flash is excellent. You probably don't need a separate flash unless you're trying to shoot action or kids which demand a fast recycle time. • The included 18 - 55mm VR II is probably all you need for everything. If you're new to photography , the strongest advice I can give you from 45 years of experience is that it's far more important to learn how to use what you've got , instead of confusing the issue by buying more lenses , as you're starting out. • Personally , I usually use the 35mm f / 1.8 DX for everything and leave the 18 - 55mm VR at home. • The D3300's LCD is big , bright , sharp and color - accurate. You couldn't really put a bigger or better screen on a camera this small. • Like most DSLRs , the battery lasts forever. The biggest worry you should have is being lulled into forgetting to bring your charger on a long trip. • New in the D3300 , a swept panorama mode lets us hand - hold and swipe the D3300 in any of four directions to make a 180º panorama. • Color rendition is superb ; the D3300 uses all the same picture controls , with matching results , to all the other current Nikon cameras. PROS : Small for a DSLR ; Retracting lens makes camera compact ; Sharp , clear images with accurate color ; Video has smooth movement ; Great price CONS : No tilting LCD screen ; Limited shooting controls. VERDICT : The Nikon D3300 is an excellent entry - level camera for aspiring photographers , delivering a good feature set and high - quality images.

Canon is more famous because of it is easy to use as well as good marketing programs such as Loyalty Programs which makes you buy Canon again and suggest your friends to buy canon , more like Network Marketing but Nikons are more sharp especially when cropped at 100% Nikon are more sharp and have Less noise. Other reason why Canon is more famous because the people who buy a DSLR Camera are 80% enthusiasts and 20% or less professionals. A non proffestional want an easy to use Camera while Proffessionals are more concerned about picture quality. These 80% can become proffessional at some point they may choose their previous brand . so there are more Canons than Nikon. Comparing D3300 and 600d , D3300 is a new camera , Faster autofocus with Expeed 4 , more megapixels 24MPX vs 18MPX , 5fps vs 3.7fps , good performance in low light - Low noise at 1385 ISO vs 793 ISO and 60fps vs 30fps D3300 is a clear winner. If you still have doubts , goto Dxomark.com and get the scientific test results and Search in google that "Nikon d3300 flickr" goto group pool open the images at 6000x4000 resolution and compare them with 600d by doing the same.

Absolute Steal at this Price level Just bought few days back so sharing early experience IQ is fantastic Easy handling Quick focus ( a problem in most of the entry level DSLR ) New processor by Nikon seems real fast Retractable lens is quite good Very handy guide mode for beginners I have not used any other one so cant actually say about the IQ of others.

Having used it for almost a fortnight , I found out the fact that there are more to praise about this DSLR than criticize and complain. Apart from the Vari - Angled - LCD which can be found in Nikon D5000 series , which is a bit fascinating and helpful in clicking vari - angled shots , this DSLR is firstly LIGHT WEIGHTED and COMPACT. The retractable AF - S 18 - 55 mm VR II Kit Lens is a bonus point added to this beauty. Though I'd suggest to go for a Nikon prime lens or a wide angle telephoto zoom lens if you are fantasizing about crisp sharp portrait images with blurry backgrounds or landscape photography. As a beginner , there's lot to learn , for which there's a special Shooting Mode called GUIDE mode which will help you additionally while taking shots of your choice. However , since it is a DSLR , the other shooting modes like Portrait , Landscape , Sports , Child , Night Portrait and other modes will help you accordingly. Another beauty added is the EFFECTS mode which can help you click images in Super Vivid mode , Silhouette mode , Pop mode , High - Key and Low - Key modes , etc. I have personally found Super Vivid mode to be very much promising if you want to play with colors. Over all , for beginners in Digital Photography , go for this one at a very reasonable price. Initially you'll get a AF - S 18 - 55 mm VR II Kit Lens along with the camera body but going forward , choose your lens according to your photography skill enhancement. A value for money buy for a value for money experience. :) \ m / Cheers... :) ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

This a a very nice product at a very low price. Its features include Smile Timer , Blink Proof alerting and Red - Eye Fix. Videos are recorded in 720p.

This camera is one the best there is in the market. At around 7800 /- this is a steal. The camera came with its charger , USB Cable and a 4gb memory card. The memory card is quite nice , and lets you click around 480 - 490 pictures. The camera's interface is quite user - friendly and it didn't take me much time to get used to its working. The quality of the pictures it takes is superb. With a 20 megapixels and Carl Zeiss lens it clicks amazing photos.

Coming back to the camera , I found it pleasing to the eye , low start - up time , and a very loong lense..... Pros ; 1. Outdoor shots are crisp & clear. 2. Good color rendition. 3. HDR works! 4. full HD video , and 60FPS & 120FPS too! Cons ; 1. at the tele end , AF doesn't work. So is when doing macro in low - light. 2. No manual control for Shutter speed & Aperture. 3. No VF 4. For HDR , Burst & Panorama , it is advised that you use a tripod. Overall verdict ; A nice camera that gives VFM , only if you are into shooting Family pics , weddings and casual stuff... If you are serious about your PG - phy , go for something else ; As a person who once owned a true SLR ( FILM ), I found this camera lacks in many fronts ; but a SLR is a SLR..... :) Happy shooting ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 14 of 16 users found this review helpful.

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great. Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

Just tilt the screen and you'll be smiling for the comfort you'll be getting with this feature. With an extra zoom button on the left gives you that extra 'grippie' control over the zoom feature. And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

( You can simply skip buying to kit lens i.e. Nikon 18 - 55mm cause once you work with prime lens you will never gonna use kit lens ) 6. 24 MP Sensor : Even after cropping images in ur system it gives superb results cause 24MP is more then we need. So once you capture a moment it help in retouch. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 7 of 8 users found this review helpful.

Transfer to iPhone or iPad using built in WIFI is brilliant for uploading to social websites! U can also use the same to take pictures as a remote control. This is possible with the nikon app that you can download for all platforms including android and iOS. I particularly like this feature as it is amazing to use ur iPhone to see the images u want to take pictures of and click ur phone to shoot them remotely!!! This alone along with the others makes it a must buy for all gadget freaks! 39 point autofocus , swivel screen , various effects , carbon fibre body shell making it extra light. The list goes on and on! When it comes to taking pictures , it is brilliant. Beginners and amateurs can use it to point and shoot in auto mode and the pics r brilliant! Semi pros and professionals can play with the apertures and exposure rates and render mind blowing pics! Kit came with Nikkor AFS 18 - 55 lenses. Picked up a prime lens AFS Nikkor 35mm. This is enough for both landscapes ( 18mm for wide angle ) and portraits ( 35mm ) Pics r extremely sharp with the 35mm lenses! This kit can be expanded with telephoto lenses for advanced photographers. If you are looking for something to point and shoot but want pictures like the pros but also want something to pick up for future expansion to a professional level.. Just go for the D5300!!! Cons : Will post if I can find something.. Best of all , I got it for the lowest price in India , thanks to Flipkart!!! Amazing product , well packaged and delivered in two days flat! Splendid!!!!

The Wifi features makes this camera one to reckon with , and well , there are so many other features that make this one of the best at the price. PS Keep checking Flipkart and keep your fingers crossed. The price fluctuates a LOT. It was for about 57k once , when I finally bought it , I got it for 51k. Last time I saw , the price was around 47 , 000. So buy it the minute it touches the least price. Also , Kudos to Flipkart.

But its a kind request to them if they could change the battery charger or the battery ( I am confused between which one is actually faulty ) it will be good. I liked the camera very much so my wife bought it. But this bad experience on the start has made me feel bad. In fact I relied most of the time on WS - Retail because of their good service and good products ( even if some times other sellers are selling in a bit low price , I preferred WS - Retail ), but this is a first bitter experience in buying products from them.

Kudos Flipkart!!! I have been a regular customer at Flipkart , but never purchased such an expensive item before ; but Flipkart delivery was awesome , with neat and safe packing with prompt handling... Nikon D5300 is an awesome DSLR and I am still learning to use it. Got it for 45000 plus for a basic bag and an 18 - 55 kit lens. Now planning to buy a 35mm prime , a 55 - 300 VR nikkor and some accessories to fill my bag... will write more later. Most recommended camera and most efficient delivery by fk.

I have checked this product and since last 10 days i am searching this camera in different site and FlipKart is too costly for this product. I checked some website and their price are 1000 less then flipKart price. Why? i don't know , but if someone can give in very low price then flipkart should sell in reasonable price.

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great. Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.

I ma using this camera for more than 3 months , no problem found whatsover and I ma very satisfied. But it might seem that the image is bit natural in ur DSLR , I have trick for u , if u check Canon 550D it will provide u much saturated color more vibrant than Nikon D3100. So make ur camera setting color as vivid and increase the saturation manually from the menu. U wont regret this buy . Trust me.

Again the company has done it with D3100. If you are a regular digital camera user and buying this as you first DSLR you will fall in love with it at first look ( really ) . The basics ; You can get the specs from any where you want so i am not wasting in writing it. Still , i will have a say about the image sensor size which is the heart of any camera and trust me this has a golden heart. If you wish to know the conversion of sensor size and 35mm comparison it is provided in the manual. Taking further the sensor is CMOS , a better variant than the D3000 which has a CCD sensor. Dont go in detail just know that CMOS is better in comparison. The build of the camera -- 9 / 10 Holding position -- very good . you feel confident when you hold it. Like it will nor slip out out. Dial and back panel buttons -- good position and quick access function. Lens - Fair enough for starters and VR -- AF does the job really well. Lack of zoom ( if somebody want it ) . Taking photos : As easy as a DSLR can get is the auto mode and guide mode. Although the guide mode a little boring but still good and must have for starters. Without much hassle you can get great photos. The manual mode is very expansive. you can make almost any change to the settings you want. Stick to the basics and go on step by step , like first setting the aperture only , and then exposure etc and you are in the way of being a pro soon. Now about the accessories : Battery -- charges very fast and lasts long. Memory -- go for any size you like it depending on how much you shoot. Rest of the accessories are standard as the data cables , HDMi cables etc are sufficient. The ferrite cores provided are very useful put it on any data cable you are planning to use. Okay guys i hope you will find it somewhat useful. If you want more please comment.

If you don't know what you are talking about , don't make such stupid , joke of the 21st century comments. DSLR doesn't deal in Number X zoom , it uses the term focal length to specify its reach , the 18 - 55mm lens that comes with a d3100 is a decent lens , if you need to take faraway stuff you have to buy a telephoto lens , ask any real photographer , photography is not about zooming , they zoom with their legs , many of them opt "primes" ( un zoomable ) for the superior quality of glass.

Permalink   Report Abuse ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Felix Dev Oct 31 , 2011 Go for a higher one instead of this handicap DSLR... Only Nikon AF - S lenses will auto focus on D3100. Nikon chose to not put a focusing motor in the D3000 , D3100 , D5000 and D5100 so you'd have to buy the more expensive AF - S lenses that have a focusing motor in the lens. The Nikon AF 50mm f1.8D is about $140.00 while the new Nikon AF - S 50mm f1.8G is about $220.00 - a nice extra $80.00 or thereabouts in profit for Nikon. If you use the AF 50mm f1.8D on your D3100 you will have to manually focus the lens. It will not auto focus on your camera. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 29 of 40 users found this review helpful.

The thing is that it can continuously auto focus while video recording and been one of the first entry level SLR to do so. The problem with video recording is that , it can only shoot 1080p at 24fps. While many other entry level SLR's can do it at 30 fps. The continuous auto focus can cause noise in the video which is a drawback.

At the same time I was intimidated by the myriad terms and features associated with a SLR. After due research , I had ordered this gem of a camera on Flipkart and got it delivered a month ago. First mention is about how easy it is to use the camera and the additional flyer materials that came with the camera. The flyer contained easy set up guide to get you started with the camera without having to read the entire manual. On the camera as well you have guide mode which makes your life a breeze when it comes to taking photos. It has easy suggestions and 'how to' for th day to day usage scenarios and hence helps you to learn photography rather than use the auto mode. Secondly the performance has been phenomenal and the battery life has been way better than what I had feared it will be. It also has sensors to detect light and it warns you if the subject is too dark or too bright prompting you to change exposure or shutter speed. If you are a person inclined to learn photography then you will use these hints and the light in the room to update your brain and learn yourself. Only downside ( which is actually not a downside for this price ) is the performance under low light. You need to have incredibly steady hands or a tripod to take night portraits to avoid blurry images. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 3 of 4 users found this review helpful.

Worst Product Not happy with the product as not as expected. Though it has a camera Lens of 20.1 Megapixels , it gives a very poor quality image. Moreover image processing is very slow after you click. And it doesn't have a chargeable battery instead cells recharging with an external adapter. This seems to be a product with an older version.

Not a very good prime ens for low light photography. 2. Understanding the utilizing the light source is very important while using this lens. 3. 40mm is not a great focal length for Macro photography. I think this lens has far more positives than negatives. Yes that's true 105mm VR is far better than this , but hey that will cost you around 48K while this lens is almost 3 times lower price than that. I am using with my D3100 , till now I am very satisfied. Macro feature is amazing. I will suggest to use the natural light wisely and surely you can be the best Macro photographer. Period.

Thanks to SWM of nikon. Cons : 1. 40mm macro is not good for bugs or insects as you need to get too close to the subject for 1 : 1 magnification. So , do not expect popped out eye of an insect kind of picture from the lens. 2. No VR ( but for this price , better be satisfied without VR !! ) 3. Lens pokes the subject sometimes while 1 : 1 macro ( due to extremely close photography in 40mm ) and the hood does not help!! Would suggest to use an UV filter to avoid pokes. Voted 5 due to the amazing price and walkaround lens with a little punch of macro in it , and ofcourse a perfect match for my D7000 DX camera. Would highly recommend to everyone who would shoot occasional macro along with regular portraits. ( Expand ) Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

Am so amazed with its macro capability. As macro is my favorite stream , it sticks on to my D5100 most of the time. But as it is 40mm , you have to get more closer to the subject to get a real macro photo ( i really mean extreme macro ) . Its great for portraits also. And about Flipkart's service...

This camera is one the best there is in the market. At around 7800 /- this is a steal. The camera came with its charger , USB Cable and a 4gb memory card. The memory card is quite nice , and lets you click around 480 - 490 pictures. The camera's interface is quite user - friendly and it didn't take me much time to get used to its working. The quality of the pictures it takes is superb. With a 20 megapixels and Carl Zeiss lens it clicks amazing photos. The details mention an 8x zoom but it can go up to 32x , but the quality of the picture at the peak of its zoom is quite bad. The camera takes … This camera is one the best there is in the market.

I got this bag a freebie along with Nikon D5100 DSLR from flipkart. About the product its a leather material and pretty good to carry your camera. The front two small compartments are perfectly made to hold a big screen smart phone ( Though I don't know the exact purpose ), Inside the bag you have enough space to keep your camera body , kit lens ( or slightly bigger once ) and the charger and can also manage to keep and extra lens. Overall a good bag to protect your camera from the outer environment. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 1 of 1 users found this review helpful.

This lens came with my Nikon D5100. Good one for beginners. But this lens is not suited for shooting pics in low light conditions and high shutter speeds , especially if you don't have a tripod. Once if you have experimented with this lens , I suggest buying a prime lens ( on with fixed focal length ) such as a 'Nikon AF - S DX Nikkor 35 mm f / 1.8G Lens' which is much faster , sharper and renders good bokeh.

Love this lens. The right zoom range , the right price and great performance. What else can you ask for? The VR is pretty effective , I have taken a few sharp pictures at below 1 / 15 shutter speed.

Nikkor 18 - 55 is a superb product It is a basic lens from Nikon shipped with all entry level and pro - sumer SLR. Within that context , it is a excellent lens. It is unlike two magnifying glasses glued to a tail pipe that comes with Canon entry level cameras. The lens has a G tag hence it is not professional lens but the quality and clarity of this lens is par excellence. I bought this to replace my older 18 - 55 ( non - VR ) lens that came with Nikon D40X. Was this review helpful?  Yes  No 0 of 0 users found this review helpful. Permalink   Report Abuse</DIV></DIV>

Overall my experience with the camera is really satisfactory as the pic that I could capture of my small baby with her fast move is really great. Only CONS that i could figure out is company is not providing the usage manual in details as I feel that the system is fully loaded but am unable to use the feature to the fullest.

Camera is just too good. Since it is just few hours that I was able to check the functionality no serious comments , but first impression is it is a value for money product. Zoom -- as expected works well when held steady and the object in focus is not moving fast. Movie recording is not upto the mark in low lights. I am just trying to get used to set the camera to shoot moving objects as most of the times the images are really blurred. Serious comments in time tocome.

Just tilt the screen and you'll be smiling for the comfort you'll be getting with this feature. With an extra zoom button on the left gives you that extra 'grippie' control over the zoom feature. And the one - touch video button is a treat to use for those 'not - to - miss' instant video moments. It has been only 2 days since I brought this beauty from Nikkon but I'm already in love with it. Oh yes , there is a minor 4x extra zoom upgrade w.r.t L820. It's now 34x. I was impressed ( with open - mouthed ) with its picture quality for a photo I clicked of a sign board 1Km away from my balcony. Only minor flip - side was the flimsy battery slit - opener.I've a feeling that it won't last long but that's like a 0.0001% downside of a 'value - for - money - technological marvel' from Nikkon. Normally you get a Free 4GB card+HDMI cable+ a pouch but that all depends upon company / retailer offer. Battery life is the same as L820 for which there are already hundreds of review comments.
