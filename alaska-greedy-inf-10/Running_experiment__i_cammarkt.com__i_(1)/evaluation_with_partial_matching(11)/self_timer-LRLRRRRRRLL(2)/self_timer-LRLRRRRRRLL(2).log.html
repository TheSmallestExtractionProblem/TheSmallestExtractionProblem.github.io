White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 6000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

Shutter Speed 1 / 8000 - 30 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

Optical Zoom 3x Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second 2.5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds 200 The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field.

Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) .

These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture.

White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) 5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f4 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds Auto The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field.

Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) .

Video Format Motion JPEG Video Format HD ( High Definition ) Video Speed 24 fps Focal Length 18 - 55 mm Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses The distance from the center of the lens to the image of an object at infinity. At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 6000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 4.7 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues.

It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) .

This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds 100 The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field. Flash Type 1600 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) .

At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 8000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds Auto The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo.

Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Optical Zoom 3x Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 1 / 8000 - 30 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Colour Temperature Adjust 30 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 1600 80 12800 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Flash Off Compression Type Auto Flash Rear Sync Flash Fill - in Flash Red - eye Reduction Flash Slow Sync JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Compression Modes Uncompressed Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution. The resolution of the pictures you take affects their quality as well as the amount of memory they utilize. Higher resolution results in higher quality , but takes up more memory. Memory Type SD Card Built - in Microphone SDHC Card SDXC Card With Built - in Microphone There are many types of memory / media for digital cameras , but most models are compatible with only one. The most common are CompactFlash and SmartMedia. Many other cameras use Memory Stick and some write the pictures directly onto mini - CDs or floppy disks.

White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims.

Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 7 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds Auto Flash Type 100 12800 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.
