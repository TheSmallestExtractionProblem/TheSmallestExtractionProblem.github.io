In this highly engaging comedy Bergman reunites Gunnar Bjornstrand and Eva Dahlbeck who had already teamed to great effect in the final comic episode of Secrets of Women (1952) and he once again casts them as an amusingly antagonistic husband and wife. Bjornstrand's character David Erneman is a successful gynecologist who has jeopardized his sixteen-year marriage by entering into an affair with one of his patients. In retaliation his wife Marianne departs for Copenhagen to revive relations with a former fiancé. David initially seems only slightly disturbed by his wife's action but when his affair ends and he enjoys an afternoon with his inscrutable daughter (Harriet Andersson in an especially plucky turn) he determines to embark for Copenhagen and win back his wife. But his initial efforts at a reunion hardly bring him success and only after a barroom altercation with his brutish rival does David seem to rekindle his wife's affection for him. En Lektion i Kärlek is a pivotal film in the Bergman canon reviving his fortunes after the critics' rejection of Gycklarnas Afton (Sawdust and Tinsel) (1953) and spurring him toward his comic masterpiece Sommarnattens Leende (Smiles of a Summer Night) (1955). Bergman came to regard En Lektion i Kärlek as a divertissement but the film is of a greater magnitude than usual comedies of domestic life and Bergman concludes it with the endearing image of Cupid strolling past the hotel room of the reunited couple.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">En Lektion i Kärlek constitutes one of Ingmar Bergman's more overtly entertaining films.

With impeccable historical accuracy Bresson re-creates the story of the peasant girl who after leading an unsuccessful revolt against the government was brought to trial convicted of heresy and burned as a witch. However Bresson shows Joan (Florence Carrez) as a woman more sophisticated and calculating and less naive than she has normally been represented.

This time the Pythonites savage the legend of King Arthur , juxtaposing some excellently selected exterior locations with an unending stream of anachronistic one - liners , non sequiturs , and slapstick set pieces. The Knights of the Round Table set off in search of the Holy Grail on foot , as their lackeys make clippety - clop sounds with coconut shells. A plague - ridden community , ringing with the cry of "bring out your dead , " offers its hale and hearty citizens to the body piles. A wedding of convenience is attacked by Arthur's minions while the pasty - faced groom continually attempts to burst into song. The good guys are nearly thwarted by the dreaded , tree - shaped "Knights Who Say Ni!" A feisty enemy warrior , bloodily shorn of his arms and legs in the thick of battle , threatens to bite off his opponent's kneecap. A French military officer shouts such taunts as "I fart in your general direction" and "I wave my private parts at your aunties." Rabbits are a particular obsession of the writers this time around , ranging from the huge Trojan Rabbit to the "killer bunny" that decapitates one of the knights. Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , and Michael Palin collaborated on the script and assumed most of the onscreen roles , while Gilliam and Jones served as co - directors.</DIV></DIV>

It looks as though wizard cat-burglar Sir Charles Litton played by David Niven in the original 1964 Pink Panther but here essayed by Christopher Plummer is back in business. Dispatched to the Swiss resort town of Gstaad by his long-suffering superior Inspector Dreyfuss (Herbert Lom) Clouseau adopts a series of easily penetrable (and hilarious) disguises to get the goods on Sir Charles and his wife Claudine (Catherine Schell). If you remember A Shot in the Dark you'll recall that Clouseau's ineptitude turned Inspector Dreyfuss into a twitching homicidal maniac. The same thing happens here paving the way for the sequel The Pink Panther Strikes Again. And as with all the "Panther" movies we are treated to the insinuating theme music by Henry Mancini and the animated opening and closing titles.

Sunday Too Far Away is a story about the struggles of itinerant sheep shearers in the Outback in the 1950s. Jack Thompson won an Australian Best Actor prize for his role as Foley a hard-drinking hard-working shearer who is the best at his profession. When local landowners try to drive away the sheep herders Foley leads a strike to establish their right to exist and live off the land. The dispute turns violent as the landowners retaliate and Foley struggles to maintain his supremacy. Many scenes were shot in the same shearing barn used in the 1960 British-Australian hit The Sundowners which was about an Irish sheepherder who emigrates to Australia.

Naturally Beale doesn't go through with it -- but he does begin rambling about the horrible state of the world in general and television in particular. He concludes his tirade by admonishing his viewers to "Go to the window and shout as loud as you can: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!'"

Set in a rapidly crumbling steeltown suburb the story focuses on shy moody Martin (John Amplas) a teenager of East European descent who may or may not be a vampire. Though he possesses no fangs or supernatural powers and has no aversions to either crucifixes or garlic Martin is nevertheless compelled to drug pretty young women slash them with razor blades and consume their blood.

Romero's superb script keeps the film's supernatural questions ambiguous focusing instead on the characters' inner turmoil as modern-day attitudes and values clash with vanishing Old World traditions.

When she turns to her friend Matthew Bennell ( Donald Sutherland ), a colleague at the Department of Public Health , he convinces her to see his friend Dr. Kibner ( Leonard Nimoy ), a pop psychologist who argues that the problem is all in Elizabeth's head. Soon , though , Matthew and Elizabeth begin to notice that people all over the city are changing subtly and inexplicably. When their friend Jack Bellicec ( Jeff Goldblum ) and his wife Nancy ( Veronica Cartwright ) find a lifeless , half - formed doppelganger covered with plant fibers in the mud baths they own and operate , the group of friends finally begins to understand that a sinister transformation is sweeping their city. Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel , respectively the star and director of the original film , have small roles in the new version , as does an unbilled Robert Duvall.</DIV></DIV>

Camp opens with Tripper and Morty preparing the misfit counselors-in-training -- Spaz Fink Crockett A.L. Candace Wendy and Wheels among them -- for the arrival of their hyperactive little charges. After settling in kids and counselors begin their activities with a soccer game in which depressed 11-year-old Rudy (Chris Makepeace) accidentally loses the game.

Romance sexy fun and comic hijinx -- usually with the heavy-sleeping Morty as their target -- lead up to an annual Olympiad in which Camp Northstar battles the wealthier and athletically superior residents of Camp Mohawk.

Obstacles to this goal include a giant come - to - life statue named Talos , the screeching harpies plaguing blind prophet Phineas ( Patrick Troughton ), a set of huge clashing rocks , the seven - headed hydra , and an army of skeletons ( this bravura climactic sequence assured Harryhausen's place in the hearts of 13 - year - old boys of all ages ) . Supporting characters include Nancy Kovack as a pre - infanticide Medea and Nigel Green as a pacifistic Hercules. Bernard Herrmann's surging musical score was icing on the cake for this greatest of all Ray Harryhausen creations.</DIV></DIV>

The disgruntled Matthau quits the service and heads to Europe where he links up with former lover (an fellow ex-agent) Glenda Jackson. All goes smoothly until Matthau acts on the advice of yet another retired agent Russian Herbert Lom who suggests that Matthau write a tell-all autobiography. Spitefully Matthau sends out copies of his first chapter to the heads of the CIA agencies throughout the world--and from that point on he and Jackson don't have a moment's peace. This delights Matthau: now that all of his former colleagues are chasing after him he has a reason to get up in the morning. As written by Brian Garfield Hopscotch was a conventionally serious espionage novel. As adapted for the big screen by Garfield and Bryan Forbes Hopscotch is a lively exercise in cloak-and-dagger comedy even when the pursuit of Matthau turns deadly towards the end.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Jane (Trish Van Devere) inherits a mansion from an aunt whom she closely resembles. The townspeople believe that her aunt was possessed by Satan and Jane becomes increasingly frightened when she is haunted by visions of a hearse that keeps showing up in front of her door. Walter Prichard (Joseph Cotton) is a argumentative attorney who does nothing to help Jane who begins to think she is having a nervous breakdown. All of this is familiar and has been done far better elsewhere. Director Bowers paces the film far too leisurely to create much suspense and the "surprise" ending is evident to all but the most unsophisticated viewer. The Hearse routine and slow will lull most horror fans to sleep.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

The 1981 film version of this tome was evidently meant to be taken seriously but the operatic direction by Frank Perry and the over-the-top portrayal of Joan Crawford by Faye Dunaway (whose makeup is remarkable) has always seemed to inspire loud laughter whenever and where-ever the film is shown. According to the film (and the book that preceded it) Joan Crawford was a licentious child-beating behemoth who stalked and postured through life as though it was one of her own pictures-more Strait-jacket than Mildred Pierce.

Surprisingly one emerges from Mommie Dearest with more sympathy for the monstrous but intensely vulnerable Crawford than for her whining daughter (played as an adult by Diana Scarwid and as a child by Mara Hobel).

While we watch as Sarah (Meryl Streep) a 19th-century Englishwoman ruined by an affair with a French lieutenant enters into another disastrous relationship with principled young Charles (Jeremy Irons) we are constantly made aware that what we're seeing is only a film.

The story takes place primarily at the country villa of a sleazy horror film director ( scenery - chomping John Vernon ), where auditions for the title role of his new film Audra are taking place. The casting session is called after the film's intended star had herself committed to an asylum in order to properly research her Frances Farmer - type role , then found herself unable to get out. It comes as little surprise , then , that the six actresses vying for the plum role in her absence are not long for this world , as a witch - masked marauder is wandering the premises with some well - honed implements. This film's surprisingly stylish look is probably due to the initial direction of acclaimed cinematographer Richard Ciupka , but the film was actually completed by a pseudonymous replacement.

Teenagers in a small town are dropping like flies apparently in the grip of mass hysteria causing their suicides. A cop's daughter (Heather Langenkamp) traces the cause to child molester Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) who was burned alive by angry parents many years before.

Teenagers in a small town are dropping like flies , apparently in the grip of mass hysteria causing their suicides. A cop's daughter ( Heather Langenkamp ) traces the cause to child molester Fred Krueger ( Robert Englund ), who was burned alive by angry parents many years before. Krueger has now come back in the dreams of his killers' children , claiming their lives as his revenge. The teenaged leads are sympathetic and intelligent , unlike the dumb victims presented in most films of the period , and they are ably backed up by veterans like John Saxon and Ronee Blakley.

In military school , he's forced to inform on a student who's the source of a practical joke ; though he beats himself up for being a Judas , he soon realizes that to rise in the ranks he must overcome his peasant background and hide his homosexuality by ingratiating himself with his superiors. In time , he becomes Chief of Military Intelligence for the Austro - Hungarian empire. Though he professes to hate politics and politicians , Redl also can't avoid them. When the leader for whom Redl is supposedly spying among the officer corps , draws up a list of who can't be exposed for traitorous activities ( including Austrian nobles , Hungarians , Czechs , Serbs , Croatians , and even the usual scapegoats , Jews -- the aftershocks of the Dreyfuss affair are still rumbling ), he tells Redl that he must find a double of himself , a Ukrainian. Now certain that he will be exposed , Redl surrenders to fate , quoting to his wife from Montaigne : "It's no sin to be involved. It's a sin to remain involved." Brandauer is a wonder as the self - loathing Redl , and Szabo's camera picks up every nuance on his expressive face. The film eschews music except for several party scenes , and the absence of a score is most effective in the final shots of Redl's fellow officers awaiting his fate.</DIV></DIV>

Adamovich and director Elem Klimov co-authored the screenplay which shows the horrors through the eyes of a 13-year-old peasant boy named Florya (Alexei Kravchenko). Over his single mother's protests he joins the partisans but they leave him behind in their camp when they set off to fight the Germans. Glascha (Olga Mironova) a lovely young girl befriends him but the two are caught in the midst of an air raid which leaves Florya nearly deaf. Now utterly frightened Florya and Glascha return to his village to find it in ruins and in one of the film's many harrowing scenes they wade through a swamp to locate the survivors. Now committed to seek vengeance for the death of his mother and neighbors Florya returns to the front but finds himself in a village that's right in the path of the Nazi firestorm.

Adamovich and director Elem Klimov co - authored the screenplay , which shows the horrors through the eyes of a 13 - year - old peasant boy named Florya ( Alexei Kravchenko ) . Over his single mother's protests , he joins the partisans , but they leave him behind in their camp when they set off to fight the Germans. Glascha ( Olga Mironova ), a lovely young girl , befriends him , but the two are caught in the midst of an air raid which leaves Florya nearly deaf. Now utterly frightened , Florya and Glascha return to his village to find it in ruins , and , in one of the film's many harrowing scenes , they wade through a swamp to locate the survivors. Now committed to seek vengeance for the death of his mother and neighbors , Florya returns to the front , but finds himself in a village that's right in the path of the Nazi firestorm. A band of partisans arrive too late to save the village but in time to capture and mete out justice to several of the Nazi officers. Awarded the Grand Prix at the 1985 Moscow Film Festival , Come and See is notable as an honest and unflinching portrait of one of the darker chapters among many in the history of the World War II.</DIV></DIV>

The film opens with a chilling prologue in which globe - trotting pervert Frank ( Sean Chapman ) -- a connoisseur of sexual depravity seeking the ultimate sensual experience -- purchases a small , intricate puzzle box from an unseen dealer in an unspecified country. Upon solving the puzzle , Frank opens the door to a hellish alternate universe and is promptly torn to ribbons by a network of hooks and chains ; his strewn body parts are subsequently collected by the Cenobites -- grotesque , S & M - clad denizens of hell. The story continues several years later , when Frank's brother , Larry ( Andrew Robinson ), moves into Frank's abandoned house with his daughter , Kirsty ( Ashley Laurence ), and his new wife , Julia ( Clare Higgins ) . An accident causes some of Larry's blood to spill on the attic floor , which somehow triggers Frank's hideous resurrection. His body only half - composed , Frank seeks the tacit assistance of Julia -- with whom he had once had a torrid sexual liaison -- in restoring him to human form. Still secretly in love with Frank , Julia assists him by seducing men from the town and bringing them back to the house so her undead lover can drain their bodies of blood. Her increasingly furtive behavior arouses the suspicions of Kirsty , who had already moved to an apartment to get away from her despised stepmother. After following Julia and her next potential victim home , Kirsty comes face to face with the still - incomplete Frank , narrowly escaping with her life...and with the puzzle box. After losing consciousness , Kirsty awakens in the hospital , where she manages to solve the box's intricate mechanism and summon a trio of Cenobites -- including their apparent leader ( played by Doug Bradley and dubbed "Pinhead" on subsequent sequels ) -- who are prepared to claim her. In desperation , Kirsty offers them a bargain in which they agree to spare her soul if she leads them to Frank. Kirsty soon returns home to find Julia with her father...whose behavior has become disturbingly unnatural. Realizing that her father has become Frank's latest victim -- and that her uncle is now walking around in his brother's skin -- Kirsty hands Frank over to the Cenobites , who have particularly evil plans for their old friend.</DIV></DIV>

Nearly the entire storyline of the previous film has been re-shot and presented in a drastically condensed form within the first few minutes: rock-jawed but clueless "hero" Ash (Campbell) now visits the mountain cabin only with girlfriend Linda (played here by Denise Bixler). Upon arrival at the cabin Ash discovers the Sumerian Book of the Dead the ritual dagger and a reel-to-reel tape containing the professor's translations of the book's hieroglyphics. The incantations summon an unseen growling spirit from within the woods which bursts into the cabin and takes possession of Linda's soul. Ash is forced to decapitate her with a shovel after which he buries her in the forest. At first dawn Ash tries to make his escape but is promptly set upon by the spirits given a solid thrashing and nearly possessed himself saved only by the arrival of sunlight. Cut off from the outside world Ash is forced to hole up in the cabin and wait for the next demonic onslaught -- which arrives sooner than expected led by Linda's rotting corpse. After being bitten by Linda's chatty decapitated head Ash's hand becomes independent of his body and begins pummeling him repeatedly. The story then jumps to a local airport where the professor's daughter Annie (Sarah Berry) and her partner Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have just arrived with the missing pages to the Necronomicon. They employ a cranky pair of local rednecks Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobbie Joe (Kassie Wesley) as guides to lead them through the dense woods to the cabin ... where at that very moment Ash is removing his belligerent hand with a chainsaw creating yet another ambulatory foe. Driven to the brink of insanity Ash fires blindly at a noise outside unaware that the new arrivals are Annie and company. Bobbie Joe is injured by the gunshot which incurs the wrath of Jake who knocks Ash senseless and locks him in the fruit cellar. Believing her father was murdered by Ash Annie plays the rest of the professor's recording to learn the truth and discovers her possessed mother was buried in the same cellar -- and not exactly resting in peace. This touches off a string of unbelievably gruesome (and hysterically funny) events including Henrietta's transformation into a stop-motion creature (reminiscent of a Ray Harryhausen creation) Ed's sudden metamorphosis into a toothy levitating ghoul and Ash's climactic confrontation with the forest demon itself. The obvious glee with which Raimi and company present this cavalcade of slime-drenched monstrosities and Three Stooges pratfalls makes it impossible to take seriously as a horror film but Evil Dead 2 is nevertheless essential viewing among connoisseurs of truly demented cinema.

Sammy and Rosie Get Laid marked the second collaboration between director Stephen Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi ; star Ayub Khan Din would go on to write another Anglo - Asian culture - clash comedy , 1998's East Is East.</DIV></DIV>

Jane works well with Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) an excellent reporter who lacks the visual charisma to make him a star.

For reasons which must remain unknown though friendship and admiration surely played a part scores of actors and filmmakers contributed freely to Welles' budgetless effort which began in 1948 and culminated with the film's winning a Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) from the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. Welles had to take other paying work during the filming of Othello because he frequently ran out of money. Also due to the protracted shooting schedule it was shot in a wide variety of locations. The makers of this 1978 documentary interviewed Welles and as many others as they could find in order to uncover as much information as they could about this legendary production. Because of its high-toned subject matter and production peculiarities the film was never more than a critical success but film devotees arranged for a fully restored version to be made available in 1992.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Bogosian plays a provocateur radio talk - show host , whose constant espousal of his inflammatory views and ceaseless hectoring of his callers and listeners reaps equal parts love and hate. As his program rolls on , Bogosian is revealed to be just as screwed up as any of his fans , if not more. And then he pushes one caller just a bit too far. In co - adapting the play for the screen , Oliver Stone interweaves elements of Steven Singular's factual book Talked to Death , the story of a liberal Denver radio personality who was murdered at the behest of a militant right - wing hate group. One word of warning : if you're not a fan of the sort of radio depicted herein , chances are you won't warm up to this film.

Tiffany gains them access to the portal , and they make the nightmarish journey down the corridors of hell. Narrowly escaping the diabolical Pinhead ( Doug Bradley ), they come face to face with Julia , who has already handed Dr. Channard over to the Cenobites to be transformed into a hideous new creation. First - time director Tony Randel acquits himself nicely , and seems to have a real flair for the surreal material ; the script by longtime Barker collaborator Peter Atkins elaborates on elements only hinted at in its predecessor. It should follow that the slightly larger budget would allow ample room for this expansion , but the production values actually appear somewhat slimmer. What the film lacks in refined style it makes up for in utter dementia , particularly in its depiction of graphic bloodletting -- numerous scenes were trimmed or deleted altogether in order to obtain an R rating from the MPAA.</DIV></DIV>

Three businesses dominate the block: a storefront radio station where a smooth-talkin' deejay (Samuel L.

Sal (Danny Aiello) serves up slices with his two sons genial Vito (Richard Edson) and angry racist Pino (John Turturro). Sal has one black employee Mookie (Spike Lee) who wants to "get paid" but lacks ambition.

Levine's Harlow is the more slickly professional though neither film is exactly a cinematic landmark. Carroll Baker plays 1930s "platinum blonde" Jean Harlow who in keeping with the portrait painted by biographer Irving Schulman and Arthur Landau (upon whose book this film is based) was a forlorn waif tossed around like a football by the predatory males of wicked old Hollywood. Prodded by a hellish stage mother (Angela Lansbury) and an implicitly incestuous stepfather (Raf Vallone) Harlow rises to the pinnacle of movie stardom but never finds true happiness. The wedding-night revelation that her new husband producer Paul Bern (Peter Lawford) is impotent is just another devastating blow for the poor girl. After all she goes through in the film Harlow's premature death at age 26 is almost a relief. The only person who truly deeply sincerely cares about her is her lovable agent Arthur Landau (played by lovable Red Buttons) who it will be remembered co-authored the original Harlow book. Movie buffs will derive some perverse pleasure by the script's many distortions of the facts notably Jean Harlow's days as a slapstick-comedy ingenue (director Gordon M. Douglas who worked at the Hal Roach studio during approximately the same period as Harlow should have known better). Whatever its shortcomings Harlow posted a huge profit for Joe Levine and Paramount Pictures.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Jack Caine (Dolph Lundgren) is a not-by-the books police officer investigating the death of several people including his partner by a gang called the "White Boys."  All the victims seemed to have died of drug overdoses but Jack thinks that there is something more sinister afoot. His investigation reveals a plot by aliens who use the bodies to extract a chemical that is sold to addicts on their home planet. Originally entitled Dark Angel I Come in Peace while silly and confusing has great production values and some excellent special effects. The main reason to see this film is because of the expert direction by former stunt-man Craig Baxley who manages to keep the action moving at a fast pace and tie up the loose ends of the threadbare story. The cinematography by Mark Irwin is outstanding and shows that imagination and a good visual sense can overcome a limited budget and a bad plot.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Things get hairy when one of the students ( Kiefer Sutherland ) becomes obsessed with the notion of really dying , the better to experience the Afterlife before being revived -- if he can be revived. In her first dramatic starring role ( playing a sensitive young lady on a misguided guilt trip ), Julia Roberts is very , very good -- completely bereft of movie - star mannerisms. Audiences flocked to see Flatliners back in 1990 due to the highly publicized off - screen romance between Roberts and Sutherland.

His brother after being beaten up spends the film bulking up on growth protein. The grandfather hires half-naked girls to bite off his toenails and in a brutal rage almost kills Léolo.

It was praised for its stunning originality and for the excellence of its execution. In addition it was praised for being a completely absorbing fable that both grownups and children can enjoy so long as the children are able to its handle scary bits (beginning perhaps at age seven or eight). In the story Jack Skellington (voice of Chris Sarandon) is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown a realm of reality where the inhabitants make it their life's work to scare humans on Halloween. He's good at his work and is very popular around town but it all bores him. In a funk one day he wanders into a wood where every tree is the doorway to realms serving one or another human holiday and falls through the doorway into Christmas. There he sees scenes of such glee and good will that he is overwhelmed. He returns to Halloweentown with the inspiration to persuade his fellow citizens to kidnap Santa and do Christmas in their own Halloweentown way -- complete with snakes and shrunken heads. Despite strong arguments against this project by Jack's otherwise loyal girlfriend Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara) Santa (voice of Edward Ivory) is duly captured and the townspeople prepare a very special Christmas for everyone. Jack is excited about the new plan and at first doesn't notice that Sally isn't around much anymore. Meanwhile Oogie Boogie (voice of Ken Page) a sinister opponent of Jack's has re-kidnapped Santa and has captured Sally as well. Since Sally is the true love of Jack's life and (he eventually realizes) the only one who can be relied upon to tell him the truth in every circumstance a confrontation with Oogie Boogie becomes inevitable. In addition to being a monumental work of animation (it took over 120 animators and many more technicians more than two years to film it) this show features ten very appropriate musical numbers by composer Danny Elfman who also supplies Jack's singing voice.

Dolores Claiborne ( Kathy Bates ) has spent nearly a quarter of a century looking after a mean - spirited woman named Vera Donovan ( Judy Parfitt ) on a small island off the coast of Maine ; when Vera is found dead after falling down a flight of stairs , Dolores is considered a prime suspect in her murder. Word of the affair reaches New York - based journalist Selena St. George ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ), Dolores's estranged daughter. Though she's about to leave on an important assignment , Selena instead flies to Maine to find out what's happened with her mother. Selena's father , Joe St. George ( David Strathairn ), died under mysterious circumstances 15 years before ; more than a few people believe Dolores killed Joe , and many feel she did the same with Vera. Though the strong and tough - talking Dolores stands her ground , police detective John Mackey ( Christopher Plummer ) is convinced that there's more to her story than she's letting on , and in time Selena learns the ugly truth about her mother's connection to both deaths.

Much of the story centers on lazy middle-school student Zhi-Qiang who is more interested in video games and his cute schoolmate than passing the test that will determine his future. As the film begins Zhi-Qiang is being beaten by his teacher for being lazy. His life changes when a local boy is abducted and he runs across the captor and ends up a captive himself. The man behind the plot is a cruel ex-cop but he is killed during a motorcycle accident and the children are left in the hands of his dim-bulbed but amiable assistant Ah-Ching.

Mastroianni first appears as Parisian traveling salesman Mateo Strano who suddenly shows up at the home of Maria the wife he abandoned twenty years before. She eventually remarried Andre. Mateo begins telling the skeptical Andre that he never really left Marie. Instead he was bewitched by fairies and has been living in the apartment across the street the entire time. He seems so serious that he is able to lure Andre to the alleged apartment. There Mateo murders him with a hammer and then calmly returns to Maria who seems nonplused by the sudden turn. With pride she shows Mateo their adopted daughter. Mastroianni next appears as Sorbonne professor of negative anthropology Georges Vickers a grown man who still lives with his cranky mother until he inexplicably leaves to become a vagrant. Living on the streets he encounters Tania a streetwalker with a passion for the philosophies of author Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan. The hooker and the tramp stay together until the day that Vickers returns and he leaves. It is soon afterward that he discovers that Tania is really the president of a major corporation. When he learns that she has been jailed for attempting to murder her creepy ex-husband Vickers uses his clout to save her. The story then jumps to a newlywed couple happily struggling in a humble garret. Their lives change dramatically when a benefactor suddenly appears and provides them with a marvelous country house. They are also given a mute butler (Mastroianni) who answers their every beck and call. It doesn't take the couple long to figure out that the sinister valet (who actually owns the chateau) is quietly poisoning them. In terror they leave but later he finds them and demands that they give him their baby daughter. He gives the child to Maria Mateo's wife. Mastroianni's fourth persona that of industrial magnate Luc Alamand then appears.

The stress causes the sudden emergence of his other disparate personalities. Interestingly though each live wildly different lives they are clearly the same mild-mannered self-effacing character.

Adrienne Mark ( Jeanne Moreau ) is the most acclaimed French novelist of her generation , whose best known work , Je M'Appelle France , was an international best - seller made into an award - winning French film ( and a disastrous Americanized remake ) . Adrienne is living in New York City when she learns that the flat in Paris where she grew up ( as Adrienne Markowsky ) is up for sale. Looking for a key to her past , she buys the apartment and discovers a cache of letters written by her late mother. Adrienne's mother died in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII , but while she's been led to believe that her mother was betrayed while working with the resistance , the letters suggest that the truth was far more troubling. Along the way , Adrienne is romantically pursued by a young fan , William O'Hara ( Josh Hamilton ), though he instead finds love with Virginia Kelly ( Sean Young ), an American film producer eager to work with the great writer. The Proprietor also features Sam Waterston , Nell Carter , and Austin Pendleton.</DIV></DIV>

Elise is an actress who finds herself out of work now that she's seen the shady side of 40 and her husband and producer Bill (Victor Garber) is demanding a divorce (and half of her fortune). Brenda helped her husband Morton (Dan Hedaya) open a profitable chain of discount electronics stores but now that his commercials have made him a minor celebrity he's taken up with a much younger (and thinner) woman.

In Keith Gordon's film adaptation of Vonnegut's book Nick Nolte stars as Howard W. Campbell Jr. an American playwright living in Germany shortly before the U.S. entered World War II. Campbell is essentially apolitical; if he sometimes hobnobs with Nazi leaders it's only because they're VIPs in his time place and social circle and he cares for little besides his writing and his beloved wife Helga (Sheryl Lee). One day Campbell is approached by Frank Wirtenan (John Goodman) an American intelligence agent who offers Campbell an unusual assignment -- a position as a radio commentator beaming Nazi propaganda broadcasts to U.S. troops across Europe which in fact feature coded information that will aid the American war effort. Campbell agrees but succeeds all too well -- he makes such a convincing Nazi sympathizer that at the end of the war he finds it impossible to convince people he wasn't really a Nazi and even those inclined to believe him feel he aided Germany as much as the Allies.

In Keith Gordon's film adaptation of Vonnegut's book , Nick Nolte stars as Howard W. Campbell Jr. , an American playwright living in Germany shortly before the U.S. entered World War II. Campbell is essentially apolitical ; if he sometimes hobnobs with Nazi leaders , it's only because they're VIPs in his time , place , and social circle , and he cares for little besides his writing and his beloved wife Helga ( Sheryl Lee ) . One day , Campbell is approached by Frank Wirtenan ( John Goodman ), an American intelligence agent who offers Campbell an unusual assignment -- a position as a radio commentator beaming Nazi propaganda broadcasts to U.S. troops across Europe , which in fact feature coded information that will aid the American war effort. Campbell agrees , but succeeds all too well -- he makes such a convincing Nazi sympathizer that at the end of the war , he finds it impossible to convince people he wasn't really a Nazi , and even those inclined to believe him feel he aided Germany as much as the Allies. After 15 years as a recluse in New York City , a racist tabloid prints a story about Campbell , and in 1961 he discovers himself behind bars , awaiting trial as a war criminal. Besides Nick Nolte , who gives an outstanding performance , the supporting cast also includes Alan Arkin , Frankie Faison , and Kirsten Dunst ; Kurt Vonnegut Jr. also makes a cameo appearance.</DIV></DIV>

For a woman who conducted her life with the bold strokes of grand opera this effort to depict her human dimension rather than her mythical qualities might not have won her personal approval but it offers a useful counterpoint to the musical play Evita by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice which was filmed at about the same time as this movie. Eva Peron was the beautiful illegitimate daughter of a rural landlord and a seamstress. She ran away to Buenos Aires when she was 15 with the help of her lover a traveling singer. Once in the Argentine capital she did everything in her power to become a prominent performer. A woman of tremendous intelligence courage cunning and guile she reportedly lacked certain essential assets necessary for stage stardom such as native acting talent. However her good looks and indomitable will took her a long way toward her goal. Then in 1944 she met Juan Peron an army officer on the rise in the Argentine government. Together they formed a winning team and with her help Juan Peron became the President of Argentina. It is during Peron's first presidency that Eva strode from the pages of history into the realms of mythology. With an impeccable sense of drama she combined her untiring and passionate advocacy for the poor with an unbridled contempt for the pretensions of the moneyed classes. Among her lasting and noteworthy accomplishments was winning the right to vote for Argentine women. Then at the height of her power and influence she died of uterine cancer.

For a woman who conducted her life with the bold strokes of grand opera , this effort to depict her human dimension rather than her mythical qualities might not have won her personal approval , but it offers a useful counterpoint to the musical play Evita by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice , which was filmed at about the same time as this movie. Eva Peron was the beautiful illegitimate daughter of a rural landlord and a seamstress. She ran away to Buenos Aires when she was 15 with the help of her lover , a traveling singer. Once in the Argentine capital , she did everything in her power to become a prominent performer. A woman of tremendous intelligence , courage , cunning and guile , she reportedly lacked certain essential assets necessary for stage stardom such as native acting talent. However , her good looks and indomitable will took her a long way toward her goal. Then , in 1944 , she met Juan Peron , an army officer on the rise in the Argentine government. Together , they formed a winning team , and with her help , Juan Peron became the President of Argentina. It is during Peron's first presidency that Eva strode from the pages of history into the realms of mythology. With an impeccable sense of drama , she combined her untiring and passionate advocacy for the poor with an unbridled contempt for the pretensions of the moneyed classes. Among her lasting and noteworthy accomplishments was winning the right to vote for Argentine women. Then , at the height of her power and influence , she died of uterine cancer. But despite the ravages of the illness , Peron maintained her public image and died with grace and dignity. While there is enough drama in her story to serve as the basis for countless movies , this one is of particular interest because it is by her countrymen.</DIV></DIV>

While everyone around him applauds the sentiment , Jerry's superiors think his ideas are bad for business ; Jerry is fired , and , rather than standing in solidarity with him , his "friends" in the firm scramble like sharks to claim Jerry's clients. At the end of his last day , the only people willing to join Jerry as he strikes out on his own are staff accountant Dorothy ( Renee Zellweger ), a single mother secretly in love with him , and Rod Tidwell ( Cuba Gooding Jr. ), a football player whose pride and arrogance have gotten in the way of his reaching his potential. Jerry Maguire earned an Academy Award for Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance as Tidwell and provided a breakthrough role for Renee Zellweger ; it also made "Show me the money!" an unavoidable catchphrase for several months.</DIV></DIV>

Devi Anjalee Deshpande has trouble adjusting to the new culture.

The plot drawn from Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker (itself based on a 19th-century British farce) is set in motion when Yonkers feed store clerk Cornelius Hackl (Michael Crawford) celebrates his promotion by taking his pal Barnaby Tucker (Danny Lockin) to New York City for a "corking good time." But Cornelius and Barnaby can't avoid crossing paths with their boss Horace Vandergelder (Walter Matthau) who'd give them Holy Ned if he saw them in a fancy restaurant with two fancy girls instead of tending the store. Mr. Vandergelder himself is the object of Dolly's affections though she pretends to have only a professional interest in the widowed merchant going through the motions of finding him a new wife when in fact she'd like to be the lucky bride herself.

Didier Temple (Fabrice Luchini) is a journalist who writes an article about a Bosnian film he had never seen calling it "pure fascist propaganda." (The director Pascal Bonitzer was once the editor of the celebrated film magazine Cahiers du Cinema. However this episode is not based on his own experiences but on an incident some years ago regarding Underground by Emir Kusturica which was declared a fascist movie by the French daily Le Monde.) Following an argument with his girlfriend Juliette (Sandrine Kiberlain) Didier's life falls apart. He is convinced he is being followed by a dark haired man. He thinks everyone is looking at him just waiting to insult him. He fights with his family. Juliette is fed up and leaves him for another man a TV director she meets in a park. At a dinner party Didier is introduced to his shadow Jerome Sauveur (Laurent Lucas) who could be his double except that he's more handsome and writes better. Didier also encounters a strange young girl Aurelie (Valentina Cervi) but Juliette soon comes back.

What is eXistenZ? According to the glossary Cronenberg put together for this film it is a new organic game system that when downloaded into humans accesses their central nervous system transporting them on a wild ride in and out of reality. What's more it changes every time it is played by adapting to the individual user -- you have to play the game to find out why you are playing the game. More than one person can plug into the same game and set out on a series of bizarre and surrealistic adventures together. The narrative takes place sometime in the near future when game designers are worshipped as superstars and players can organically enter inside the games. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the goddess among computer game designers whose latest invention 'eXistenZ' taps deeply into its users' fears and desires by blurring the boundaries between reality and escapism is subject to an assassination attempt and forced to flee. Her sole ally is Ted Pikul (Jude Law) a novice security guard sworn to protect her. Persuading Ted to play the game Allegra draws them both into a phantasmagoric world where existence ends and eXistenZ begins. Jennifer Jason Leigh who is supposedly something of a computer nerd in real life is hip and sexily alluring as Allegra Geller. When she and Pikul make love and are transported to the bizarre setting of a trout farm which has been converted to an assembly line production plant for games they delve deeper into the dangerously intriguing game. Soon the forces of Anti-eXistenZialism will close in on Pikul and Allegra. eXistenZ marks the first time since Videodrome that Cronenberg has written a completely original screenplay. eXistenZ was inspired by the tribulations of the fugitive writer Salman Rushdie author of the Satanic Verses. After interviewing the author for a magazine article in 1995 Cronenberg was struck with the idea of an artist who suddenly finds himself on a hit list for religious or philosophical reasons and is forced to go into hiding. The idea of a game came later on for which he created a new vocabulary. According to Cronenberg  eXistenZ thematically connects to Crash Videodrome Naked Lunch and even M. Butterfly in terms of exploring the extent to which we create our own levels of reality and the idea of a creative act being dangerous to the creator. This is the second film on which Alliance Atlantis has been associated with Cronenberg after Crash which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 International Cannes Film Festival.

Julien lives at home with his pregnant sister Pearl ( Chloe Sevigny ); his brother Chris ( Evan Neumann ), who wrestles in his spare time ; and their violent father ( Werner Herzog ), who slaps his children around , hoses them down with water , and offers to pay Chris ten dollars to dress up in his late mother's clothes and dance.

The original story took place in the 18th century and revolved around a former servant girl Marja who is married to plain simple-minded and older Juha but in love with Russian salesman and 'Casanova' Shemeikka. Kaurismaki's story is set in the late 1970's shot silent and furnished with captions to disclose the dialogue. It is meant to be watched with live music preferably with the score's composer Anssi Tikanmaki conducting his own orchestra. Absence of sound (dialogue) is not really new for Kaurismaki whose 1990 masterpiece Tulitikkutehtaan tyttö/The Match Factory Girl took 17 minutes before a word was uttered. Instead of imitating silent movies Kaurismaki placed his version of  Juha at the moment of the history of silent film when some sound could be used. Acting style and images start somewhere in the late 1920's and towards the end slowly move into the '50's B-movie style. With Timo Salmien behind the lenses who has been collaborating as cinematographer with Aki and brother Mika Kaurismaki since 1981 and some of the regular cast (such as André Wilms Elina Salo Sakari Kuosmanen and Kati Outinen) Juha is distinctively a Kaurismaki film. Published in 1911 well-known Finnish author Juhani Aho's tragic drama has been filmed three times before. The first was Johan in 1920 by Mauritz Stiller who staged it in provincial Sweden (which was a strange locale for the Finnish audiences). The second Juha was brought to screen in 1937 by Nyrki Tapiovaara who was faithful to the script but the film was not very successful. The third Juha was by Toivo Sarkka in 1956 and it was also the first Finnish film shot in color.

As the couple tries various tests and alternate methods of conception to no avail , Reza continually reassures Leila that it's not important to him to have children -- only to be with her. But Reza is the only male child in his family , and his mother ( Jamileh Sheikhi ), an old - fashioned woman , is determined for him to have a son to continue the family line. She continually harangues Leila , telling her that Reza desperately wants a child , even if he insists to Leila that he doesn't. Eventually all the pressure from Reza's mother and her own feelings of inadequacy get to Leila , and she agrees to allow Reza to take a second wife who can have his child. As the couple grow more despondent and uncertain as to how to please one another , Reza , unable to assuage Leila's guilt , reluctantly agrees to meet several women his mother has selected as potential second wives. At first , Reza and Leila joke about the unsuitability of the women he's fixed up with , and rediscover some of the joy in their own loving marriage , but eventually their resistance wears down , and they both give in to his mother's wishes.</DIV></DIV>

However Rose is too high strung and too much the New Jersey native to ever feel truly at home in the South. In addition her business is not doing well and her husband isn't even trying to be discreet about his infidelity. One day Rose's anger gets the better of her and she kills her husband dragging the body to the walk-in cooler in her shop until she can figure out what to do with it.

The fathers at the convent are outraged and one Father Cuna (Damian Alcazar) who has already killed Father Serra to seize control of the mission makes it clear that Maria is to be stopped at all cost.

Maria becomes delusional and starts hearing voices as she obsessively cleans the floors of the chapel. Abandoning her inheritance and her last vestiges of privilege , she leaves the mission to work among the poor , where she is said to be able to heal the sick with her faith. The fathers at the convent are outraged , and one , Father Cuna ( Damian Alcazar ), who has already killed Father Serra to seize control of the mission , makes it clear that Maria is to be stopped at all cost. The directorial debut from Eduardo Rossoff , Ave Maria was shown at the 1999 Guadalajara Film Festival.</DIV></DIV>

In the winter of 1999 Xiao Bo a shy young man arrives in Beijing to look for work. He is employed by an unhappily married woman Qing Jie who is full of maternal instincts. Qing Jie lets him sleep in her house and tries to introduce him to her girlfriend. Soon it becomes apparent that Xiao Bo is not interested in girls. Qing Jie's husband tries to rape him one day when they are alone in the house prompting Xiao Bo to leave and seek shelter with Chong Chong the editor of an underground magazine devoted to graffiti collected from public toilets known to be gay cruising areas. Chong Chong is living with another man who is jealous of the new arrival. A tender love develops between Xiao Bo and Chong Chong which has the significance of 'coming out' for Xiao Bo. In the meantime Qing Jie has made up her mind to leave her husband and live with her girlfriend with whom she has been having an affair. The film was shot with non-professional actors except for the leading actor Qing Jie who had previously appeared in some television films. The tempo is adjusted to that of everyday life where nothing much seems to happen on the outside. People go to work come home exhausted and dream of vacations.

Help arrives in the form of financier Sim Rosedale ( Anthony LaPaglia ), who extends to Lily a businesslike proposition of marriage ; though she is tempted , Lily refuses his offer because he is nouveau riche rather than blueblood society. Soldiering on , Lily journeys to the Mediterranean , where she has been invited to the home of Bertha Dorset ( Laura Linney ), an alpha socialite who schemes to use Lily as an unwitting decoy for an affair under the nose of her husband George ( Terry Kinney ) . When the trip starts to go bad , George tells Lily that he wants to divorce the slatternly Bertha , but needs some solid proof of her affairs in order to do so. Lily knows that one of Bertha's previous lovers was Selden , but her loyalty to him prevents her from speaking up to George. So , still in debt to Gus and given only a paltry inheritance by her aunt ( Eleanor Bron ), Lily endures a slew of unsuccessful jobs and , tragically , gradually sinks into the mire of genteel poverty. Directed by Terence Davies , House of Mirth premiered at the 2000 Locarno Film Festival.</DIV></DIV>

The film's title refers to the name of a haute cuisine restaurant run by a self - satisfied conservative couple , Henri ( Jacques Boudet ) and Loretta ( Andrea Ferreol ) . When the two find themselves overworked in the kitchen , they retreat to the local orphanage to find some cheap waitressing help , and the teenaged Diamantine ( Meiji U Tum'si ) fits the bill perfectly. The haughty couple has more plans for the girl than just waiting tables , however -- the conspicuously accommodating Henri and Loretta are actually bad - mouthing the girl behind her back to the townspeople and the restaurant's patrons. They go so far as to ask the naive Diamantine to pretend that she's pregnant , and she complies under the assumption that it's a harmless prank. When their intentions are revealed , however , the girl becomes wise to the couple's self - satisfied scheming , and sets her sights on revenge. Set in late - 1960s France , the film was shot entirely on digital video and then transferred to 35mm prints ; Van Peebles composed the score himself. Le Conte du Ventre Plein was first shown as a special presentation at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.</DIV></DIV>

They were met by a diverse group of activists ranging from youthful peace-punks to veteran trade union members who intended to publicly air their concerns about issues of economic justice Third World labor policies and environmental safety that were being ignored by many of the WTO's affiliates. Police soon clashed with the protesters the vast majority of which were gathered peacefully and had obtained permits for their gatherings. While Seattle authorities attempted to portray the protesters as a violent rabble in statements to the media a number of activists armed with film and video cameras were on hand to document the protests who then used the Internet and independent media outlets to bring their side of the story to the public. This Is What Democracy Looks Like was compiled by directors Jill Friedberg and Rick Rowley from material shot by more than a hundred "media activists" who captured a side of the WTO protests largely ignored by the mainstream news media. This Is What Democracy Looks Like is narrated by actress Susan Sarandon and Michael Franti leader of the leftist hip-hop group Spearhead; radical rock band Rage Against the Machine also appears in the film.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Some prints of La Mort en ce Jardin bear the title Gina. hel ) F Lorsque L'Enfant Paris ( When the Child Appears ) was adapted from the hit play by Andre Roussin. The story revolves around the efforts of a well - meaning , highly moralistic minister , who wants the government to clamp down on illegitimacy. Complications ensue when the minister's own wife become pregnant -- and all evidence indicates that the child is not his. Adding to the protagonist's headaches , his daughter , on the eve of her wedding to a wealthy young man , announces that she , too , may well be in the family way. Not to be left out , the minister's son declares that he thinks he's impregnated his father's secretary!</DIV></DIV>

After several social engagements Jae-hoon suggests to Young-soo that he might be interested in financing his next film. Jae-hoon begins to pursue Soo-jung who keeps him at bay for a while.

The repressive act of necrophilia changes into something else when the girl returns from the other world and instead of pressing charges tries to get to know her "savior" better. The film is a commentary on contemporary times where it seems to be easier to have sex than to make love. All characters have problems in their relationships with others.

G. Clouzot's Le Mystère Picasso was an unmitigated commercial disaster - all the more tragic when one considers the groundbreaking nature of its content.   Like Emmer before him Clouzot offers rare and precious glimpses of Pablo Picasso at work. The film watches Picasso draw or paint 15 different works often via tightly-compressed time-lapse cinematography. All of the featured masterpieces were intentionally destroyed following production meaning that they exist only in the cinematic realm. With this documentary Clouzot comes as close as humanly possible to defining the genius of Picasso within the parameters of the camera lens. Oddly Le Mystère Picasso does not appear on many of the "official" lists of Clouzot's films even though it won a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

With numerous cinematic references and allusions (Bergman Godard Woo Hartley) the tale begins with a black-and-white silent sequence depicting Death chasing a young man through Old Baghdad. The setting shifts to present-day New York where a Japanese man Kenji (Takeshi Kaneshiro of Chungking Express) is seen abed in a sparsely furnished apartment. Kinji goes to a local cafe where he chats with several others: Italian friend Fabrizio (Michael Imperioli) who proclaims "Lubitsch is the god!"; a literary wit Balzac Man (Jeffrey Wright); and an enigmatic German woman Pola (Geno Lechner) who hints at a possible sexual liaison with Kinji. Death (Mira Sorvino) drifts about assuming various forms -- disco gal Japanese geisha Chinese woman devil with a red dress on and a French-accented figure dressed as a man. The sad and lonely Death informs Kenji that she has no choice in determining her victims and he also learns from her that he has only 12 hours left to live. She suggests that he make the most of his remaining minutes so he sets forth on a series of brief adventures. At the cafe he chides famous artist John Sage (Ben Gazzara) for being involved with a decades-younger girlfriend the beautiful Korean Anouk (Hye Soo Kim). Sage invites Kenji to dinner at their home and Death invites herself. Kenji makes the proposal that since he's due to die he could be allowed sex with Anouk as a final act. This request isn't well received by anyone present leaving Kenji to his own devices as the darkness closes in. Mira Sorvino wears a virtual fashion show of colorful costumes in this movie which also provided her with the opportunity to speak Chinese onscreen for the first time. Sorvino majored in Asian studies at Harvard and lived for eight months (1988-89) in Beijing where she studied Chinese taught English and viewed a variety of Chinese films.

In their travels , Adam and Maggie encounter Mrs. Assingham ( Anjelica Huston ), an American socialite who enjoys playing matchmaker , whether or not her subjects are interested. She introduces Maggie to Prince Amerigo ( Jeremy Northam ), a handsome but penniless member of Italian royalty , and after a bit of prodding , they announce their intention to marry. Mrs. Assingham also pushes Adam into a relationship with Charlotte ( Uma Thurman ), a close friend of Maggie , and they too decide to wed. However , no one else knows that Amerigo and Charlotte were once lovers , who broke off their relationship because he couldn't marry a commoner with no money. Their passion is eventually too strong to resist , and they embark on an adulterous affair , which becomes even more dangerous when Mrs. Assingham learns of it.

Shot in stark black and white the film opens with the sudden and inexplicably bloody hijacking of a bus in rural Kyushu.  The crazed gunman (Riju Go) shoots two passengers in the back as they try to flee. Stepping out of the bus for some fresh air the hijacker drags bus driver Makoto (played by the ubiquitous Koji Yakusho) along for cover. When the driver faints and falls to the ground police snipers shoot the terrorist. In his last dying effort the hijacker stumbles back on board the bus where he murders an old lady and tries to kill a pair of shocked schoolchildren Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki) and Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki). Two years later the experience has wreaked havoc on the lives of the three sole survivors. Distanced and easily distracted Makoto's weird behavior -- particularly his habit of wandering off unannounced for days at a time -- finally takes its toll on his marriage. Meanwhile Naoki and Kozue are left mute from the event though they can communicate. The silent siblings' mother soon walks out of her marriage and their father kills himself in a car wreck leaving them alone in a large house with a substantial insurance check. Having found work at a construction company Makoto's strange behavior starts to raise a few eyebrows especially when he utterly ignores the advances of a comely office worker. Soon the village is rocked by news of murdered women washing up on a nearby river bank; Makoto's brother suspects him and asks him to leave their family house. He shows up on the doorstep of Naoki and Kozue's house which has devolved into utter disrepair and the trio forms a family of sorts. Their relative peace and order is upset by Akihiko (Yohichiroh Saitoh) the bumptious cousin from Tokyo on vacation from college who is insensitive to the trauma that the trio has endured and increasingly suspicious of the kids' ersatz guardian. His disapproval of Makoto grows when that same comely office work turns up dead and Makoto is the prime suspect. Looking to break out of their routine and cleared of murder charges Makoto purchases an old bus and converts it into a camper. Taking his three housemates on an odyssey that begins at the site of the hijacking they slowly start to reconcile the grief and pain that so destroyed their lives. Unfortunately the killing seems to follow them along their way.

Snyder begins by looking at the first recorded outbreak of the illness which took place in Lake Tahoe NV in the mid-'80s. She shows brief interviews with people from the area including sufferers (some of whom have still not recovered) local doctors and public relations-types who are eager to dismiss the condition as hypochondria -- to downplay its seriousness in order to alleviate fears and protect the reputation of their resort town. Snyder exposes the CDC's failure to investigate the syndrome thoroughly. The CDC came up with the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" naming a complex and serious condition after one of its symptoms which one sufferer complains is akin to calling tuberculosis "Coughing Disease." Snyder also investigates earlier unrecognized outbreaks from around the world including one epidemic in Florida which occurred decades ago. Snyder tracks down survivors and doctors from this outbreak and interviews them about their experience. The heart of Snyder's documentary is her in-depth interviews with sufferers of CFS -- including filmmaker Blake Edwards (The Pink Panther) Olympic gold medallist soccer star Michelle Akers and a young man named Steven -- bedridden for two years because of the illness -- who Snyder captures attending his high school graduation.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Kim A.

Alex's cousin Norman (Bill Cohen) works in Hollywood as a producer and actually thinks the Jagger Stevens idea has potential so he asks Alex to write a script. However Alex doesn't know the first thing about screenwriting; he signs up for a class in writing for film but he hasn't made much progress beyond attracting a girl named Gwen (Judy Prescott) whom he isn't even sure he likes. However there's a new waiter at the restaurant Joey (Kerr Smith) who is good looking gay and has an admirer named Elliot (Peter Jacobson) who happens to be a screenwriter. Alex and Elliot meet through Joey and before long begin collaborating on a script although Jagger Stevens is a good bit different after Elliot gets through with him. Hit and Runway was the debut feature for director/co-screenwriter Christopher Livingston and was screened at the 1999 Los Angeles Independent Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Can two men , one straight and one gay , find happiness together writing a cheesy action movie?

But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of  what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without).

Fox is the voice of Milo Thatch , a lowly museum employee and linguist in the early 20th century who's determined to continue his late grandfather's search for the lost , sunken empire of Atlantis. Bankrolled by eccentric millionaire Preston Whitmore ( John Mahoney ), Milo teams up with a diverse crew of mercenaries led by submarine commander Rourke ( James Garner ) . After a sea battle with a giant denizen of the deep , the explorers locate the submerged civilization. Milo falls in love with Princess Kida ( Cree Summer ), the daughter of Atlantis' aged ruler ( Leonard Nimoy ), and must choose sides when it's revealed that some of his fellow expedition members intend to steal a mystical energy source from their hosts. Claudia Christian , Mark Hamill , David Ogden Stiers , Don Novello , and the late Jim Varney co - star. Although considered a shoo - in for a nomination in the debut year of the new Oscar category of Best Animated Feature , Atlantis : The Lost Empire faced stiff competition from other non - live - action entertainment in the summer of 2001 , including Shrek , Final Fantasy , and Monsters Inc..</DIV></DIV>

As a founder of the influential Nuyorican Poets Cafe his poetry soon became recognized as a forerunner to rap and hip-hop music. TV screenwriter turned director Leon Ichaso spins this impressionistic biographical look at this artist. Raised in an abusive family Pinero (Benjamin Bratt) turns to streets for solace. Soon he is engaging in petty crime drug dealing and addiction. When he finds himself in Sing-Sing he turns his experiences in prison into the play Short Eyes which eventually garners him seven Tony awards in 1974. Uncomfortable with his new fame he clings to his girlfriend Sugar (Talisa Soto) and his childhood buddy Miguel Algarin (Giancarlo Esposito) who is a literature professor and who co-founded the Nuyorican Cafe. Though Pinero makes cameos on such shows as Kojak his art begins to suffer as he starts to succumb to his drug addictions.

Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition Amelie didn't attend school with other children but spent most of her time in her room where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine (Lorella Cravotta) died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight and her father Raphael (Rufus) had limited contact with her since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997 Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette (Isabelle Nanty) a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria and Joseph (Dominique Pinon) an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment she returns them to their former owner Mr. Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou) sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel (Serge Merlin) an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle thanks to a rare disease that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris. Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain received unusually enthusiastic advance reviews prior to its French premiere in the spring of 2001 and was well received at a special free screening at that year's Cannes Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">One woman decides to change the world by changing the lives of the people she knows in this charming and romantic comic fantasy from director Jean - Pierre Jeunet.

Dr. Wilhelm von Huber (James Woods) is a German expatriate scientist living in the United States in the early '60s who has been hired by the fledging National Aeronautics and Space Administration to help America launch its newly formed space program. Von Huber is recently widowed and his son Wilhelm II (Alex D. Linz) -- known as Billy to most of his friends -- is still dealing with the loss of his mother.

A half-vampire half-human hybrid Blade (Snipes) is a merciless vampire hunter bent on destroying the bloodsuckers that feed on humanity. The keys to Blade's success are a serum that allows him to resist the urge for blood and an array of inventive deadly weapons both of which were once supplied by his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson).

Snow Dogs stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as Ted Brooks a Florida-dwelling dentist with a successful chain of offices and a comfy poolside lifestyle. All this changes however when he finds out that he was actually adopted as a child and that his birth mother has died and left him an inheritance in her home state of Alaska of all places. After arriving in the snow-bound clime Ted learns that he has been willed a pack of cutely named sled dogs: Demon Diesel Dutchess Nana Mack Scooper Sniff and Yodel. Problem is the town's premiere sled-dogger Thunder Jack (James Coburn) wants the pack for himself and encourages Ted to go back to his tropical environs. But with a major sled-dog race looming Ted's inspired to learn the ropes as it were and prove himself worthy of his birth mother's inheritance -- any way he can. Snow Dogs was directed by Jingle All the Way's Brian Levant and features some animatronic dog effects by Jim Henson's Creature Shop; the script was very loosely adapted from popular author Gary Paulsen's nonfiction book Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Considering Broomfield's track record that the film is dangerous sensational and occasionally very funny is no surprise. What is somewhat shocking in a very rewarding and commendable way is how moving Biggie and Tupac is. Using archival footage of the two rap stars and interviews with many of those involved Broomfield uncovers significant evidence that corrupt LAPD cops were involved in the two deaths and that the FBI was doing surveillance on Biggie (Christopher Wallace) on the night he was murdered. Broomfield's film also strongly suggests that Death Row Records head Suge Knight orchestrated both murders. Few satisfactory conclusions are drawn but the film should at least encourage further investigation of these claims. By running the camera constantly even before the interviews begin Broomfield frequently catches his subjects off guard. But even if Broomfield had uncovered nothing Biggie and Tupac would still be an entertaining and valuable telling of the tragic deaths of two talented young men. The filmmaker's interviews with Biggie's friends and particularly his charming mother Voletta Wallace paint a picture of a surprisingly sensitive and goodhearted young man.

Considering Broomfield's track record , that the film is dangerous , sensational , and occasionally very funny is no surprise. What is somewhat shocking , in a very rewarding and commendable way , is how moving Biggie and Tupac is. Using archival footage of the two rap stars and interviews with many of those involved , Broomfield uncovers significant evidence that corrupt LAPD cops were involved in the two deaths , and that the FBI was doing surveillance on Biggie ( Christopher Wallace ) on the night he was murdered. Broomfield's film also strongly suggests that Death Row Records head Suge Knight orchestrated both murders. Few satisfactory conclusions are drawn , but the film should at least encourage further investigation of these claims. By running the camera constantly , even before the interviews begin , Broomfield frequently catches his subjects off guard. But even if Broomfield had uncovered nothing , Biggie and Tupac would still be an entertaining and valuable telling of the tragic deaths of two talented young men. The filmmaker's interviews with Biggie's friends , and particularly his charming mother , Voletta Wallace , paint a picture of a surprisingly sensitive and goodhearted young man. Broomfield was granted less access to Tupac Shakur's family ( Tupac's mother is still involved in business dealings with Knight ; she doesn't appear in the film and she refused Broomfield permission to use Tupac's music ), but he still manages to expose the controversial rapper's essential humanity.

But what was he like before he formed the Nazi party? Screenwriter and director Menno Meyjes explores that question in this drama a work of fiction keyed to the fact that Hitler unsuccessfully pursued a career as an artist following World War I. In 1918 Max Rothman (John Cusack) is a former artist who lost an arm during the war. While Max can no longer create his eye for talent is as keen as ever so he has become a successful art dealer specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz. Max's success has brought him a fine home and a beautiful wife Nina (Molly Parker); he's also acquired a mistress Liselore (Leelee Sobieski) a lovely young woman with artistic aspirations of her own. One day Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) an emotionally intense fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich. Adolf fancies himself an artist and while Max isn't especially impressed with his technique he sees in him a burning passion and a desire to communicate so he encourages Adolf to express his demons through his art. While Adolf takes Max's advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him Max's friends find Adolf's open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max who is Jewish simply chalks Adolf's attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences. But as Adolf immerses himself more deeply into his political interests and his thoughts on social engineering he begins to leave painting behind in favor of a more interesting art form the political arena.

The movie opens at a refugee camp in Peshawar , Pakistan , where Afghans have sought refuge in the wake of the U.S. military campaign in their country following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks. The story follows Jamal , an orphaned teenager , and Enayat , his older companion , as they make their way from Pakistan to London. Traveling in the back of trucks , by bus , and on foot , the two cross Central Asia in an arduous journey punctuated by encounters with hostile border guards and shady smugglers. Even more traumatic is the ocean voyage from Turkey to Italy , during which Jamal and Enayat are forced to hide in a shipping container with other asylum seekers , including a terrified infant. Winterbottom shot the movie vérité - style on digital video , and the smudgy look and quick cutting betray the movie's guerrilla roots. Enhancing its raw veneer is Winterbottom's reliance on improvised dialogue and non - actors. A stirring work of advocacy , this flawed but wrenching film won the Golden Bear at the 2003 Berlin Film Festival.</DIV></DIV>

Arnold was an outgoing and well-liked schoolteacher with an interest in electronics who also ran a private computer school out of their home. Elaine a reserved but caring woman helped look after the couple's three sons Jesse Seth and David. All appeared to be happy in their lives until November 1987 when police raided the Friedman home after Arnold and Jesse were accused of multiple counts of child molestation. A search revealed that Arnold owned a sizable collection of child pornography and he confessed to some of the charges placed against him; Jesse however firmly insisted he was innocent. As the investigation against the Friedmans went on public opinion regarding the case became more and more heated but not all of the testimony against Arnold and Jesse matched up and some began to wonder just how many of the charges filed against the family had merit. Remarkably enough in the midst of these crises which threatened to destroy the family from within the Friedmans continued to take part in one of their favorite pastimes -- shooting home videos of their day-to-day lives offering a fly-on-the-wall look at a family struggling (and often failing) to hold themselves together in the wake of unthinkable accusations. Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki not only documented the legal and emotional struggles of the Friedman family with his own cameras but was given access to the family's archive of home videos and the result was Capturing the Friedmans a documentary which keeps its primary focus on the Friedman family while also investigating the merits or faults in the charges levied against them. Capturing the Friedmans received an enthusiastic reception in its screening at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

When two of his friends are murdered by the killer , Bo decides he must step in to help catch the killer that Huysmans hasn't yet found on his own , though Bo soon falls into a dangerous position when he falls in love with Johnny ( Stephane Metzger ), a sullen and street - smart hustler who helps rent - boys find profitable assignations with older women.</DIV></DIV>

McElwee is drawn to the subject after meeting his second cousin John a film memorabilia collector who shows McElwee an old Warner Bros. film from 1950 Bright Leaf in which Gary Cooper stars (alongside Patricia Neal and Lauren Bacall) as a tobacco magnate who builds himself up from nothing only to lose everything to a rich powerful and ruthless Southern gentleman. The film reminds McElwee of the stories his father used to tell about his great grandfather who built up a fortune in the tobacco business but spent years and tens of thousands of dollars suing the Duke family (the most powerful tobacco growers in American history and founders of Duke University) for stealing his famous "Durham Bull" brand. The battle ruined him and left the family bankrupt. McElwee decides to investigate the origins of the film which leads him to explore his own connection to the tobacco industry. Even though his family is no longer in the business McElwee feels guilty about his family's "contribution to global tobacco addiction." McElwee interviews cancer patients including former patients of his late father a surgeon. He also interviews several friends who smoke or who have ties to the tobacco industry. In focusing on Bright Leaf he finds himself interviewing film historian Vlada Petric and actress Neal. All of this is intertwined with a very personal family history involving his relationship with his father his son and the whole issue of smoking.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

The haunting story begins with war journalist Paul (Matthew MacFadyen) who returns to his childhood home to bury his father.

Phillippe just barely supports himself as a telemarketer , his cold - calling has put him in touch with a former girlfriend who isn't especially happy to hear from him , and an attempt to discuss his research with a former Russian cosmonaut has near - disastrous results. Phillippe also has to put up with his younger brother André ( also played by Lepage ), a television weather announcer who has money , a small degree of fame , a handsome boyfriend , and almost no respect for Phillippe. As his mother's health takes a severe turn for the worst , Phillippe's luck seems to have changed at last when he's invited to Russia to discuss his recently published thesis on the space program , but André is not willing to help look after their mother. Far Side of the Moon ( aka La Face Cachée de la Lune ) was written , directed , and edited by leading man Lepage , who adapted the script from his own stage play.</DIV></DIV>

When eccentric billionaire Constance Pennington passes on , she leaves her entire fortune to her closest companion , Bailey. However , there's something that sets Bailey apart from most of the nuevo riche -- Bailey is a golden retriever dog. Bailey's best human friend is Ted ( Dean Cain ), a handsome but nerdy animal behaviorist who has learned to communicate with Bailey in "dogish." Ted looks after the wealthy pooch with Bailey's blessings , but Bailey's new fame and wealth don't sit well with everyone -- Caspar Pennington ( Tim Curry ), Constance's nephew , is infuriated that a dog has inherited his aunt's fortune. With the help of his shrewish wife , Dolores ( Jennifer Tilly ), Caspar sets up the Animal Rights and Research Foundation ( ARRF ), and installs Ted on the boards alongside Marge ( Laurie Holden ), a cute single mother and animal rights activist. But Caspar and Dolores hardly have benevolent aims in mind -- ARRF is supposed to keep Ted and Marge busy while the Penningtons kidnap Bailey and find a way to prove to the world that Ted has been abusing the dog. Jon Lovitz provides the speaking voice of Bailey.</DIV></DIV>

Tony Takitani (Issey Ogata) is the son of a Japanese musician with a passion for jazz who spent most of World War II in Shanghai and was later sentenced to a stretch in prison following the war. Tony was named in honor of an American serviceman who befriended his father but his name also earned him the suspicion of his classmates and he had few close friends as a child a situation aggravated by the death of his mother. While Tony displayed great technical skill as an artist his work lacked feeling and he ended up pursuing a successful career as a technical illustrator. One day Tony meets Eiko Konuma (Rie Miyazawa) a beautiful woman working with one of his clients and he is immediately entranced. Feeling as if he's found his soul mate Tony becomes fully inspired for the first time in his life and soon asks Eiko for her hand in marriage.

The world's major military powers saw no financial or political advantage to getting involved in the crisis in Rwanda , so they refused to help , and as a result , 800 , 000 Rwandans were slaughtered. Dallaire regarded this as a predictable and preventable act of genocide executed by the Hutu - controlled government against Hutu oppositionists and Tutsis...a massacre he could only watch without being able to help. Nearly ten years after the tragedy in Rwanda , Dallaire returned to the nation to see what was left of the country he tried to protect ; Shake Hands With the Devil : The Journey of Roméo Dallaire is a documentary which follows him as he discusses the massacre of Rwanda , what could have been done , and how the horrific experience has changed his life. The genocide in Rwanda also provides the basis for the acclaimed dramatic feature Hotel Rwanda ( 2004 ), in which a fictional character based on Roméo Dallaire is played by Nick Nolte.</DIV></DIV>

Mrs. Li knows about their rejuvenating powers and she also knows about their unpleasant main ingredient but after some initial nausea she digs right in. In Oldboy writer/director Park Chan-wook's "Cut" a successful filmmaker (Lee Byung-hun of Joint Security Area) arrives home to find that a disgruntled extra (Lim Won-hee) has taken over his home and fastened his pianist wife (Kang Hye-jun of Oldboy) to the grand piano.

One day , a new boy enters the camp , Isak ( Maja Stankovska ), who displays a calm but resilient nature that's different from the fearful attitudes of the other children. After initial resistance , Lem becomes close friends with Isak , and their friendship helps Lem confront the horrors of camp life in a new way. Writer and director Ivo Trajkov cast teenage actress Maja Stankovska to play Isak after a long series of unsuccessful auditions failed to find a young man who had the right look for the role.</DIV></DIV>

Leroy's fictional memoir which documents a boy's truly harrowing road to adulthood. Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett) is the seven-year-old son of Sarah (Asia Argento) an unstable and unwed mother who abandoned her son and left him to be raised by foster parents. Jeremiah has come to love his guardians and is devastated when Sarah arrives at their doorstep demanding her child back. Threatening Jeremiah with torture if he tries to run away Sarah introduces her young son to drugs and encourages her one-night-stand paramours to help "discipline" her son when she feels his behavior is inappropriate. Sarah marries a man named Emerson (Jeremy Renner) but abandons him shortly afterward; Emerson responds by molesting Jeremiah and soon the child is left in the care of his grandparents (Peter Fonda and Ornella Muti) members of a fundamentalist Christian sect which emphasizes child discipline that's strict to the point of abuse. After three years Sarah returns with a new husband Kenny (Matt Schulze) and takes Jeremiah (now played by Dylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse) with her; Kenny spends most of his time on the road as a trucker and Sarah supports the family at home as a stripper and a prostitute. Sarah also begins dressing her son is girl's clothing which excites the perverse appetites of Sarah's latest boyfriend Jackson (Marilyn Manson); she soon leaves Jackson and pairs off with Chester (Jeremy Sisto) a biker with a dangerous way of making a living. The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened as part of the "Directors Fortnight" series.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

While Allende was popular with his constituency , he and his agenda of democratic socialism were seen as a threat by the United States , and Henry Kissinger said of his election , "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people." In 1973 , a coup d'etat backed by the United States toppled Allende's leadership , and the former president soon committed suicide. General Augusto Pinochet rose to power in the wake of the coup , leading to a 17 - year reign of terror marked by torture and political executions. Salvador Allende is a documentary which looks at the political career of the fallen leader , exploring both his rise to the presidency and the forces that collaborated to remove him from office against the will of the people. Former United States ambassador to Chile Edward Korry is among those interviewed about the American role in Allende's fall.</DIV></DIV>

When a case involving an animal laboratory finds the distracted dad once again taking an extended leave of absence from his frustrated family , Douglas' luck takes a turn for the worst after he is inadvertently infected by a top - secret genetic - mutation serum that transforms the two - legged lawyer into a four - legged sheepdog. Though his current situation has its drawbacks to be sure , the fly - on - the - wall perspective afforded to Douglas in his newfound state alerts the well - intending father and husband that all is not well on the home front. Moved by the unfulfilled needs of his neglected family and determined to become a better father if he can only shed his winter coat , Douglas' unique new vantage point could offer just the motivation needed to bring the nefarious forces behind the serum to justice and win back his wife and kids once and for all.</DIV></DIV>

In the first segment "Meant to Be" an elderly shopkeeper suffers from the pangs of loneliness until an encounter with the blind and deaf Theresa Chan (via her autobiography) changes his life; the 61-year-old Chan portrays herself in the segment and shares her story with the audience. The second "So in Love" chronicles the experiences of two teenage lesbians whose lives are about to change irrevocably. In the third "Finding Love" a middle-aged security guard (Seet Keng-Yew) divides his affections between food and an infatuation with a professional woman who works in his building. He feels too intimidated to approach the girl formally but ultimately decides to make himself known with a letter.

Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett) are a couple from the United States who have traveled to Morocco in Northern Africa on a vacation after the death of one of their children has sent Susan into a deep depression. Richard and Susan's other two children have been left in the care of Amelia (Adriana Barraza) their housekeeper. Amelia is originally from Mexico and her oldest son is getting married in Tijuana. Unable to find someone who can watch the kids or to obtain permission to take the day off Amelia takes the children with her as she travels across the border for the celebration. Around the same time in Morocco a poor farmer buys a hunting rifle and he gives it to his sons to scare off the predatory animals that have been thinning out their goat herd. The boys decide to test the weapon's range by shooting at a bus far away; the shot hits Susan in the shoulder and soon she's bleeding severely while police are convinced the attack is the work of terrorists. In Japan Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) is a teenage deaf-mute whose mother recently committed suicide. This despairing confused girl experiences such rage and frustration that she causes her volleyball team to lose a match and later yanks her underwear off and begins exposing herself to boys in a crowded restaurant. Chieko's father then struggles to reach past the emotional distance which separates him and his daughter. Babel earned Alejandro González Iñárritu the prize for Best Director at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">The tragic aftermath of human carelessness travels around the world in this multi - narrative drama from filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu.

Kingsley (Jeremy Irons) is a director looking to adapt for the screen a Polish gypsy folktale that was previously stalled when the two leads were viciously murdered.

Assigned the task of infiltrating Sayle's impenetrable lair by posing as the winner of a computer magazine contest , Alex makes the acquaintance of shady Sayle sidekicks Mr. Grin ( Andy Serkis ) and Nadia Vole ( Missi Pyle ) before getting a special sneak preview of the remarkable Stormbreaker's true powers. His cover subsequently blown , Alex is given a key piece of information regarding the remarkable computer before being thrown to a giant jellyfish by Sayle and his henchmen and left to die just as the prime minister is about to push the button that will activate Stormbreaker computers all across Britain. With no time to spare and the fate of a nation hanging in the balance , Alex must now enlist the help of his trusted housekeeper Jack Starbright ( Alicia Silverstone ) and faithful classmate Sabina Pleasure ( Sarah Bolger ) in ensuring that the Stormbreaker system is not activated and revealing Sayle for the true villain that he is before the young super spy's breathless first mission becomes his fatal last.</DIV></DIV>

The story is presented through a series of chapters of varying lengths with titles like "The News That They are Coming" "We the Resurrected" "The Freeze" "Only Problems and Work." and finally "The Circle Is Completed." The enormously complex saga is centered in an abandoned farm machinery plant upon a Hungarian plain. There live a small band of hobos including three couples a doctor with a drinking problem. All of them want to leave and they will do anything they can to do it. A set series of events occurs but the story presents those events from each of the different character's viewpoints.

In 1784 21-year-old William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was elected to the British House of Commons and soon established himself as a politician with a conscience. Several years later his close friend William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) became prime minister and together they made a bold plan to introduce a bill banning slavery before the English legislature. Wilberforce was aided by anti-slavery activists Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell); however pro-slavery hard-liners Lord Tarleton (Ciarán Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) spearheaded a hard-fought opposition to the legislation and despite Wilberforce's best efforts his bill went down in defeat. In 1797 Wilberforce left politics due to poor health and a battered spirit; staying at the country home of his friends Henry and Marianne Thornton (Nicholas Farrell and Sylvestra Le Touzel) he became acquainted with Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) a beautiful woman with progressive views.

Born in a small town in Connecticut , Ralph Nader was raised to believe the words of his father that "you can fight city hall , " and Nader made a nationwide reputation for his willingness to take on the wealthy and powerful. After receiving a degree from Harvard Law School , Nader first became a household name in 1965 with his book Unsafe at Any Speed , in which he detailed the auto industry's willingness to sacrifice safety in the name of greater profits. The book so outraged General Motors that they hired investigators to dig up dirt on Nader and make trouble for him ; the plan backfired when Nader sued for invasion of privacy and walked away with a 425 , 000 - dollar settlement that he used to set up an activist group to investigate both public servants and private commerce and how they live up to their responsibilities. However , Nader's long career as a incorruptible watchdog was tarnished in 2004 when Nader ran for president in a campaign that attracted a great deal of attention for a third party candidate -- and was blamed by many Democrats for drawing enough votes away from Al Gore to allow George W. Bush to walk away with an extremely narrow victory. An Unreasonable Man was directed by Henriette Mantel and Stephen Skrovan , the former of whom worked as a member of Nader's staff in the '70s.</DIV></DIV>

Filmmaker Jasmine Dellal followed the tour with a camera crew , and When the Road Bends : Tales of a Gypsy Caravan offers a look at the music these artists performed on stage as well as their interaction after the shows and on the road ; the film also features individual interviews with the musicians back home after the tour was completed.</DIV></DIV>

Wade affirmed a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion , President George W. Bush's conservative appointments to the Supreme Court threaten to overturn the decision and filmmakers Stephen Fell and Will Thompson set out to document what many consider to be the most controversial social movement in American history. Over the course of one year , Fell and Thompson were granted unprecedented access to pro - life groups , leaders in the movement , and fundraising campaigns that are working harder than ever to reverse the Roe v. Wade decision. With college credit offered to university students who communicate the pro - life message , it seems that activists of all ages are working to outlaw abortion. As the battle to determine a woman's right to privacy rages , however , many question what it really means to win the war. Interviews with over 70 of the pro - life movement's most active proponents and captivating archival footage combine to examine the social movement that has effectively split American politics right down the middle.</DIV></DIV>

But in the years to follow , bitterness and inveterate disappointment ensued as Dr. Paskowitz tried to settle into a conventional existence. Two broken marriages and a medical career that Dorian would later describe as "miserable" left him clawing his way out , desperate for an "alternative" lifestyle.

As one child after another cropped up over the course of a decade , the family toured the country winning one surfing competition after another , and Dr. Paskowitz accepted low - rent medical jobs for the poor that reeled in little to no income. In theory , this all seemed idealistic , even utopian ; in reality , Dorian Paskowitz was reportedly a severe disciplinarian who denied his children the benefits of school and financial security , forced everyone to stick to an almost unbearable diet of a gruel - like substance , and -- even more alarmingly -- felt comfortable having open and noisy sex with his wife , with the children only a few feet away. In time , as one child after another grew up , left the clan , and attempted to survive , they found it difficult , if not impossible to function in the day - to - day world without the education , social skills , and monetary know - how that so many young adults take for granted. With his documentary Surfwise , filmmaker Doug Pray tells the Paskowitzes' strange , bewildering , and ultimately heartbreaking story via incisive interviews with family members , still photographs , and telling archival footage.</DIV></DIV>

Bindler directs this wave-twisting tale of a soul-searching surfer (Matthew McConaughey) in the midst of an existential crisis.

Upon returning to his hometown of Malibu to spend the summer with old friends Steve begins to sense that the good vibes he remembers as a boy have been hopelessly corrupted by the powers that be.

(1972). When wacky co-ed Judy Maxwell (Barbra Streisand in the Katharine Hepburn part) spies nebbishy musicologist Howard Bannister (Ryan O'Neal in bespectacled Cary Grant mode) in a San Francisco hotel lobby she decides that Howard and his precious igneous rocks are right up her alley. Too bad Howard already has a fiancée the propriety-fixated Eunice (Madeline Kahn in her film debut). Using all her arcane knowledge from brief stays at numerous colleges Judy tries to charm her way to a $20000 grant for Howard and Howard himself at a banquet with grantor Frederick Larrabee (Austin Pendleton). Things get even more complicated the next day when Judy's underwear-filled overnight bag gets mixed up with Howard's rock bag which gets mixed up with Mrs. Van Hoskins' bag of jewels which gets mixed up with Mr. Smith's bag of top secret government papers. All sides converge at Larrabee's mod townhouse and the chase begins. Retaining Hawks' machine-gun pace (as well as the sly pop culture referentiality of Billy Wilder) Bogdanovich and writers Buck Henry David Newman and Robert Benton updated the opposites-attract screwball convention for contemporary times. O'Neal gently parodied not only Grant but also his own Love Story (1970) preppy while Kahn represents stiff-wigged 1950s manners as opposed to Streisand's long-haired pants-wearing free spirit. The happy ending in which Cole Porter-belting youth wins out over old manners found favor with audiences as What's Up Doc? became one of the most popular films of 1972 and the second hit in a row for Bogdanovich after 1971's The Last Picture Show.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

When Arbie's high - school sweetheart , Wendy ( Kate Graham ), returns home after her first year of college , the lovelorn teen attempts to win the object of his affections back by taking her to the site of their first romantic encounter. Unfortunately for Arbie , the ancient Tromahawk Tribe Indian burial grounds have been bulldozed to make way for an American Chicken Bunker restaurant , and Wendy has turned into a left - wing lesbian with a penchant for protesting. Subsequently beaten to a pulp by Wendy's rough - and - tumble girlfriend , Micki ( Allyson Sereboff ), and in desperate need of a steady job , disgruntled Arbie applies at the Chicken Bunker despite the fact that Wendy and Micki have launched a tireless campaign against the restaurant. But something supernatural is stirring in this poultry paradise ; the spirits of the dead are not pleased that their eternal slumber has been interrupted. As the employees of the American Chicken Bunker begin dying a series of increasingly gruesome deaths , restaurant owner General Lee Roy ( Robin L. Watkins ) does his best to cover up the scandal and keep his customers in the dark. Meanwhile , the restless demons of the Tromahawk tribe vow to take revenge on the fast - food - loving masses by infecting every last piece of genetically modified poultry that is served at the Chicken Bunker. Perhaps if Arbie can prevent their curse from reaching beyond the drive - through window , he can save the world from a fate worse than trans fat and finally win back the girl of his dreams.</DIV></DIV>

But appearances can sometimes be deceptive and despite having all the creature comforts Lazar is constantly trying to live up to the demands of his overbearing mother and discontented spouse.

Vietnam Veterans Against the War (or VVAW) was a group formed by men who had served in Vietnam and had come to believe that the war -- and America's presence in it -- was wrong. In early 1971 as reports of the 1968 My Lai Massacre and the court martial of Lt. William Calley were still in the news the VVAW organized what they called "the Winter Soldier Investigation" in which Vietnam vets and VVAW members were encouraged to come forward and take part in public hearings in which they discussed war crimes they had witnessed first hand. Held in Detroit the hearings were an emotional outpouring in which veterans discussed horrific violence against civilians women and children talked about how military commanders sought to dehumanize the Viet Cong in the eyes of the soldiers and expressed their desire to prevent other young men from suffering as they did. A handful of filmmakers were on hand to document the event and Winter Soldier is a disturbing but often moving account of men coming to terms with the horrors of war. While the makers of Winter Soldier were uncredited on screen they included Fred Aranow Nancy Baker Robert Fiore David Gillis Barbara Koppel Michael Lesser and Michael Weil. The title of the film and the investigation came from the work of Thomas Paine who in 1776 wrote "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman." ~ Mark Deming All Movie Guide</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Edoardo has a beautiful wife Allegra (Marisa Berenson) and they have four grown children -- Tancredi (Pippo Delbono) Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti) Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro) and Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher). The family gathers for a reunion at Edoardo and Allegra's villa in Milan with Tancredi's wife Emma (Tilda Swinton) and Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini) a chef planning on going into business with Edoardo also in attendance. But the happy gathering takes a somber turn when Edoardo suddenly dies while having lunch with the family. The death takes the family by surprise and causes nearly everyone to reassess themselves and their lives. In the months that follow Allegra discovers that Elisabetta is a lesbian and deals with new desires of her own when she falls in love with Antonio. Tancredi finds that his relationship with Emma is not as stable as it once was as he struggles to keep up the elegant image of the Recchi name.

From Academy Award-winning writer/director Sofia Coppola ("Lost in Translation" "The Virgin Suicides" "Marie Antoinette") "Somewhere" is a witty moving and empathetic look into the orbit of actor Johnny Marco (played by Stephen Dorff). You have probably seen him in the tabloids; Johnny is living at the legendary Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood. He has a Ferrari to drive around in and a constant stream of girls and pills to stay in with. Comfortably numbed Johnny drifts along. Then his 11-year-old daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning) from his failed marriage arrives unexpectedly at the Chateau. Their encounters encourage Johnny to face up to where he is in life and confront the question that we all must: which path in life will you take? Filmed entirely on location "Somewhere" reunites the writer/director with "Lost in Translation" editor Sarah Flack and production designer Anne Ross. Stacey Battat ("Broken English") is the costume designer and Harris Savides ("Elephant") is the director of photography on "Somewhere."</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Populated by musicians comedians and strippers and cloaked in an overarching gaudiness 'burly' shows typically a dime for a single admission. Especially during difficult eras such as The Great Depression the shows enabled male attendees to temporarily cast their troubles aside. As helmed by Leslie Zemeckis (documentarist wife of Robert Zemeckis) this chronicle examines the "burly" tradition by interviewing authors historians and burlesque participants including former strippers comedians and novelty acts. Taken together the personal reminiscences not only reflect a broad spectrum of emotions from triumph to tragedy but add up to a historical chronicle of a unusual now-extinct subculture that will remain forever tied to the early-mid 20th century.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

This film adaptation from Georgian director Dover Koshashvili follows the original text with remarkable fidelity; in it Laevsky (Andrew Scott) clings to ephemeral pleasures such as drinking gambling and romancing his alluring mistress Nadya (Fiona Glascott) in the Russian provinces - putting all of the said pursuits far ahead of disciplined action - but he soon grows listless and disenchanted with Nadya falls into financial ruin and ultimately must fight Van Koren in a vicious duel thanks to Nadya's sexual liaisons with the man.

At a Swiss spa upper-class expatriate American Frederick Winterbourne (Barry Brown) meets pretty nouveau riche flirt Daisy Miller (Cybill Shepherd); her bratty xenophobic little brother Randolph (James McMurtry); and her tremulous nattering mother (Cloris Leachman). Despite warnings from his dowager aunt (Mildred Natwick) about Daisy's recklessness with men Winterbourne finds himself drawn to her. When he encounters her again in Rome he tries to convince her that her liberated behavior with an Italian admirer (Duilio Del Prete) may sully her reputation in aristocratic circles. But Winterbourne cannot reconcile his own feelings for Daisy with the manners that he is used to following nor can he fathom how she may feel about him beneath her veneer of willful coquetry. After society matron Mrs. Walker (Eileen Brennan) ostracizes her Daisy's final rash action reveals to Winterbourne how his old-fashioned mores may have sealed her fate. With a screenplay by Frederic Raphael and location shooting in Rome and Switzerland Bogdanovich carefully recreated the rich surroundings and stultifying social strictures of James' story. Despite this well-executed atmosphere Daisy Miller suffered critically as Bogdanovich was especially taken to task for casting the amateurish Shepherd in the complex and pivotal role of Daisy. After three consecutive hits with The Last Picture Show (1971) What's Up Doc?

The pair embarks on an oddball journey to get Thunderbolt's loot from an old robbery before his former associates the sadistic Red (George Kennedy) and cretinous Goody (Geoffrey Lewis) get to it first but all four are too late; the one-room schoolhouse hiding place has apparently vanished.

In this Japanese film the mythological foundations of Japanese society are explained away albeit poetically. Here the Sun Goddess responsible for the founding of Japan is seen as conniving woman Himiko (Masao Kusakari) who rules a small portion of the Japanese islands in the third century through her influence over several powerful men. When she is killed for reasons of political expediency the film zooms back to reveal her mourners as figures in modern-day Japan.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Using modern scientific biases to strip away the mystery behind ancient legends is an activity not confined to Europe or the Americas.
