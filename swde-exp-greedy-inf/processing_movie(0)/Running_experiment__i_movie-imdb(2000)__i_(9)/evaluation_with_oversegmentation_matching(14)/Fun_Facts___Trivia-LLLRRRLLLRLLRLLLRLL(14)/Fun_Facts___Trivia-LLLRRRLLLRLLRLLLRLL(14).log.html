About three weeks into filming he was fired along with cinematographer Pal Gyulay and several other crew members after Disney executives viewed the initial dailies. Among other things the footage was severely out of focus; this was blamed on both Gyulay (who was described as "in over his head" and "out of his league") and the production's older set of Panavision anamorphic lenses. Executive producer Kathleen Kennedy originally asked Mikael Salomon to take over as cinematographer (she had shown him an early draft of the script which he loved while they were working together on Always and he asked her to remember him if there was a chance for him to shoot it). However Steven Spielberg pushed for Salomon to be offered the job of director knowing that he had been wanting to move from cinematography to directing for some time. After accepting Salomon asked Juan Ruiz Anchía to be the new cinematographer and rush-ordered a set of Panavision's newer sharper Primo anamorphic lenses.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

Striking crew members report that they were quite touched by her action which was more than a gesture but rather a sincere belief in workers' rights. On her part Polley called her union the Screen Actors Guild to tell her of her action and the union representative told her they'd back her if she crossed the picket line. SAG assumed that she was calling to ask whether she could defy the strike and cross the picket line! A shocked and dismayed Polley stayed out with the strikers and the strike ended after three days when their grievances were met. Subsequently Polley has stated that she has been told that she lost several job offers due to this incident as producers don't want a union 'militant' despite the film industry being a craft industry dominated by the guild (union) system and she did what she felt was right.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Orange; color: White;">fn</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">null</DIV></DIV>

The shape of his head resembles that of a human head probably to make Godzilla less scary.
