Of course there's no way to convey the actual horrors endured by the survivors of the camp , where millions of Jews were killed and abused , and though the trial was not filmed , hundreds of hours of audio tapes from the hearing have allowed documentarians Rolf Bickel and Dietrich Wagner to provide the film with an intense soundtrack of survivor's testimony. Anguished voices recount the daily horrors they endured , with refugees coming from all over the world to testify against their former oppressors. The tapes are underscored with footage from SS archives and the Russian liberation of the camp as well as the courtroom and modern - day Europe. Originally aired on German television in 1993 in three parts -- "The Investigation , " "The Trial , " and "The Verdict" -- it plays to devastating effect as a three - hour omnibus. The film , which was released to American theaters in a limited run shortly after the execution of Saddam Hussein , is a chilling testament to the quickness with which even the most horrific crimes can become buried by time and change , only to be uncovered as raw and festering as ever.</DIV></DIV>

In the interim , Eddie Murphy made the marginally better Showtime and started fishing for a career revival that wasn't a sequel to his previous hits. In the satirical , lunar - colony hash of Pluto Nash , Murphy's a variant of Casablanca's Rick Blaine in the year 2087 , happily running the moon's hottest nightclub , refusing a buyout offer from a greedy gambler , and suffering the consequences with his sidekick robot ( Randy Quaid in yet another thankless role ) and newest employee ( Rosario Dawson , before doing similar time in Men in Black II ) . A visual hybrid of Total Recall and A.I. , this nearly laughless comedy would be a total write - off if it weren't for Murphy's stalwart attempt to jump - start the flagging humor. He's got the chops of a superstar , but only when his collaborators are on the same page. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

After two decades of running from this cinematic disaster , the cast can no longer hide from the legion of followers that celebrate them for their ineptitude. BEST WORST MOVIE , directed by TROLL 2's once - disgraced child star , Michael Paul Stephenson , unravels the stories of these unforgettable real - life characters and the colorful army of devotees who continue to revel in the film's perfectly flawed brilliance. At the center of this celebrated documentary is the improbable story of a small - town Alabama dentist - turned - cult - movie - icon , and an Italian filmmaker who come to terms ( or doesn't ) with his internationally revered cinematic failure. BEST WORST MOVIE is an affectionate and intoxicatingly fun tribute to the single greatest bad movie ever made and the people responsible for unleashing it on the world. The result is a hilarious and tender offbeat journey that pays homage to lovers of bad movies and the people who make them , while investigating a deeper story about the strange nature of celebrity , the catharsis of redemption and the humanity that exists in making even the worst movie ever made.</DIV></DIV>

Not only do Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy throw comedic sparks as a married team of lawyers on opposing sides of a high - profile case , but their exquisite verbal jousting was scripted by the outstanding team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. Leading all of this stellar talent was director George Cukor at the prime of his career. The result is one of Hollywood's greatest comedy classics , still packing a punch with its sophisticated gender politics. Arguably the best of the Tracy - Hepburn vehicles , Adam's Rib shows the stars at their finest in roles that not only made their off - screen love so entertainingly obvious , but also defined their timeless screen personas -- she the intelligent , savvy , rebellious woman ahead of her time , he the easygoing but obstinate modern man who can't help but love her. Screen teams don't get any better than this. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

But before he could try and snuggle up to her at nap time , or maybe send her a valentine , his family moved away. In the intervening years there have been other women in Nate's life , but none who could measure up to Cristabel. Convinced she's the only girl for him , Nate decides to move back to L.A. and track her down. The good news : she's still single and stunning. The bad news : there's a reason she's still single. Cristabel's still best friends with the same less fortunate little girl Nate remembers from first grade , June Phigg. The two are inseparable. They live together. They go to yoga together. They would even go on double dates together...if only June could get a date. Cristabel simply refuses to leave dear June home alone. Determined to spend as much time as possible with Cristabel , Nate sets out to find a boyfriend for June. Even when he pays them , however , guys all flee at the sight of her. Then it hits him : June needs a makeover. As Nate and June become friends she emerges from her cocoon , and Nate slowly realizes that the girl of his dreams isn't the hottie at all. It's the nottie -- who turns out to be something of a hottie herself.</DIV></DIV>

With unprecedented access , she traces the exotic world of secret mystic societies and centuries - old traditions and pageantry ; diamond - encrusted crowns , voluminous , hand - sewn gowns , surreal masks and enormous paper mache floats. Against this opulent backdrop , she uncovers a tangled web of historical violence and power dynamics , elusive forces that keep this hallowed tradition organized along enduring color lines.</DIV></DIV>

Bob Roberts is a folksinger with a difference : He offers tunes that protest welfare chiselers , liberal whining , and the like. As the filmmakers follow his campaign , Robbins gives needle - sharp insight into the way candidates manipulate the media. While the film follows Roberts's campaign , it also covers a fringe journalist ( Giancarlo Esposito ), who may have dug up the kind of dirt to push Roberts's campaign off the rails. Robbins captures the chilly insincerity of this right - wing populist and fills his cast with terrific supporting players , including Alan Rickman as the campaign's shadowy financier and Susan Sarandon and Peter Gallagher as a pair of airhead TV news anchors. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

The women's historic achievement finds its voice in a narrative that intersperses interviews , archival images , and scenes of present - day Liberia together to recount the memories of a few of the women who were there. In 2003 , Liberia was a country devastated by decades of political dislocation , humanitarian crisis , and street - to - street urban warfare. Charles Taylor , then President of Liberia , had emptied the country's pockets as creatively as any dictator in memory. His ascent to power led to the deaths of thousands of people and a nation in complete ruin. Out of the wreckage , more than 2000 Christian and Muslim women throughout the country began to organize and banded together in an effort to bring an end to the fighting. At great person risk , they protested creatively and persistently for peace in the worst days of brutal and protracted civil conflict.</DIV></DIV>

After months of anguished contemplation , Chaplin decided to finish the film as it began -- in silence , save for a musical score and an occasional sound effect. Once again cast as the Little Tramp , Chaplin makes the acquaintance of a blind flower girl ( Virginia Cherrill ), who through a series of coincidences has gotten the impression that the shabby tramp is a millionaire. A second storyline begins when the tramp rescues a genuine millionaire ( Harry Myers ) from committing suicide. When drunk , the millionaire expansively treats the tramp as a friend and equal ; when sober , he doesn't even recognize him. The two plots come together when the tramp attempts to raise enough money for the blind girl to have an eye operation. Highlights include an extended boxing sequence pitting scrawny Chaplin against muscle - bound Hank Mann , and the poignant final scene in which the now - sighted flower girl sees her impoverished benefactor for the first time. Chaplin's decision to release the silent City Lights three years into the talkie era was partially vindicated when more than one critic singled out this comedy in pantomime as the best picture of 1931.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

DAY ZERO follows the lives of three best friends in New York City who have thirty days to come to terms with their fate - the draft is back and they've been called to serve. Dixon , Rifkin and Feller grew up together in New York. Living very different lives in the same city , their childhood friendship still binds them. Rifkin ( Chris Klein ) is a married lawyer whose career is on the rise. He's just made partner and is looking for any loop hole to get out of serving. Now "just isn't a good time" for him.

Instead he draws up his list of "Top 10 things to do before I serve." Dixon ( Jon Bernthal ) drives a cab , lives a solitary life and is proud and ready to serve - until he meets someone and finally has something to lose. Over thirty days , they will find their relationships tested as they confront long held beliefs about life , death , courage and love.</DIV></DIV>

Based on Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon , which introduced the world to the nefarious killer Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter , the film stars William Petersen ( giving a suitably brooding performance ) as ex - FBI agent Will Graham , who is coaxed out of semiretirement to track down a serial killer who has thwarted the authorities at every turn. Graham's approach to the case is a perilous one. First he seeks counsel with Lecter ( Brian Cox ) in the latter's high - security prison cell -- an encounter that is utterly horrifying in its psychological effect -- and then he begins to mold his own psyche to that of the killer , with potentially devastating results. As directed by Mann ( who was at the acme of his success with TV's Miami Vice ), this sophisticated cat - and - mouse game never resorts to the compromise of cheap thrills. Predating Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Lecter by four years , Cox plays the character closer to Harris's original , lower - key conception , and he's no less compelling in the role. Petersen is equally well cast , and as always Mann employs rock music to astonishing effect , using nearly all of Iron Butterfly's heavy - metal epic "In - A - Gadda - Da - Vida" to accompany the film's heart - stopping climactic sequence. All of this makes Manhunter one of the finest films of its kind , as well as further proof that Harris's fiction is a blessing to any filmmaker brave enough to adapt it. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

No Jackie Chan movie could be a total misfire , however , and he's charmingly self - effacing here as a hapless chauffeur who inadvertently replaces his injured super - agent boss ( Jason Issacs ) and foils a madman ( Ritchie Coster ) who plans to infect the world's water supply ( ! ) and reap a fortune selling pure bottled water. Jackie's a bumbling superhero after donning his boss's high - tech , Inspector Gadget - like tuxedo ( it even has a "Mambo" setting ), and curvaceous co - agent Jennifer Love Hewitt coaches him in crime fighting while closing in on the bad guys. It's all as routinely ridiculous as it sounds -- Jackie's faux James Brown act is the only real highlight -- and as critic Roger Ebert observed , the climax hinges on an insect queen that doesn't exist in nature! So , while Jackie and Jennifer provide a few moments of stellar stunts and random amusement , you can blame this mess on screenwriters who didn't do their homework. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

He doesn't wear a helmet because clearly his head is not a particularly vulnerable area. As he leaps upon a vicious Vietcong who's brutally bayoneting a buddy of Braddock's , he plucks the rings from two hand grenades -- and wakes from a recurring nightmare. Haunted by his memories , Braddock joins a delegation sent to Vietnam to negotiate for the return of missing - in - action prisoners of war ( hence the movie's title , Missing in Action ) . But when the communist government accuses Braddock of war crimes , he fights back! It's all pretty preposterous -- particularly the subtler absurdities , like when Braddock dresses entirely in stealthy ninjalike black except for his head , allowing his feathered blond locks to fly free -- but fans of this kind of jingoistic action flick will find it satisfying enough. The fight scenes are frequent , if not particularly imaginative. Also featuring the great character actor M. Emmet Walsh as an old army buddy who helps Braddock out when the going gets tough. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

Joanne Woodward won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eve , a young Georgia housewife suffering from multiple personalities. Eve's husband ( David Wayne ), confused by his wife's aberrant behavior when assuming her two other selves , seeks out help from a psychiatrist ( Lee J. Cobb ) . Carefully probing Eve's subconscious via hypnosis , the doctor finds out that , though each of Eve's personalities is aware of the other's existence , none are related. After months of therapy , Eve is purged of her negative selves and is totally cured. Ironically , Joanne Woodward would herself play a psychologist confronted with a multiple - personality case in the Emmy - winning 1976 TV movie Sybil.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

The two play sisters of a stubborn , alcoholic Iowa farmer ( Jason Robards ), who decides to leave his fertile farm to them and their youngest sister ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) . It is a decision that rends the family , setting siblings against one another and forcing long - held secrets out of their guilty closets. The family dynamics become ever more destructive , and the refuge of sanity the two older sisters have created may be their only salvation. It's a tragedy not quite on a Shakespearean scale , but anyone who appreciates the difficulties of a dysfunctional family will relate to the heartbreak -- and the promise of redemption. Pfeiffer especially is breathtaking as the good housewife Rose , whose rage at her father and her husband is never far from her placid surface. -- Anne Hurley</DIV></DIV>

This serenity is broken only by the occasional , carefully restrained reference to the past , giving a sense that this marriage may not always have been such a fairy tale. This tendency of Fiona's to make such references , along with her increasingly evident memory loss , creates a tension that is usually brushed off casually by both of them. But , when it is no longer possible for either of them to ignore the fact that Fiona is being consumed by Alzheimer's disease , the limits of their love and loyalty must be wrenchingly redefined.</DIV></DIV>

If Simon can get in with the right DC people , if his entourage of one can sleep with the right intern , and if they can both stop the Prime Minister's chief spin - doctor Malcolm Tucker rigging the vote at the UN , they can halt the war. If they don't... well , they can always fire their Director of Communications Judy , who they never liked anyway and who's back home dealing with voters with blocked drains and a man who's angry about a collapsing wall.</DIV></DIV>

His interactions with his co - workers offer some relief from the monotony , and their discussions encompass everything from music to the decline of American culture to new flavors of jellybeans and life itself. At home , Harvey fills his days with reading , writing and listening to jazz. His apartment is filled with thousands of books and LPs , and he regularly scours Cleveland's thrift stores and garage sales for more , savoring the rare joy of a 25 - cent find. It is at one of these junk sales that Harvey meets Robert Crumb , a greeting card artist and music enthusiast. When , years later , Crumb finds international success for his underground comics , the idea that comic books can be a valid art form for adults inspires Harvey to write his own brand of comic book. An admirer of naturalist writers like Theodore Dreiser , Harvey makes his "American Splendor" a truthful , unsentimental record of his working - class life , a warts - and - all self portrait. First published in 1976 , the comic earns Harvey cult fame throughout the 1980s and eventually leads him to the sardonic Joyce Barber , a partner in a Delaware comic book store who end ups being Harvey's true soul mate as they experience the bizarre byproducts of Harvey's cult celebrity stature.</DIV></DIV>

Lee plays Richleau with a dark elegance and intensity -- he's a commanding figure with a trim goatee who discovers that the son of a war buddy has joined a satanic cult lorded over by the quietly malevolent Mocata ( Charles Gray , best known as the narrator in The Rocky Horror Picture Show ) . Director Terence Fisher , working from a literate script by genre scribe Richard Matheson , creates a strikingly handsome period piece ( set in 1920s rural England ) dripping in dread as Richleau and Mocata battle for the souls of two young lovers on both physical and spiritual planes. The action scenes are well handled and the towering Lee cuts quite a figure leaping through hoards of robed devil worshippers to save a sacrificial victim , but the film peaks in an eerie supernatural battle in which Richleau and his skeptical party confronts Mocata's demons while protected in a giant pentagram. The effects are coarse and dated by today's standards , but the gorgeous period detail , vivid color , and unsettling imagery create a sinister ambiance , and Fisher's mix of psychodrama and swashbuckling action makes for an engrossing thriller , a life - and - death struggle between two masters of the forces of light and darkness. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

In repose , Chow's sleepy magnetism recalls the glory days of Robert Mitchum , Steve McQueen , and Takakura Ken ; when he's stepping high , Chow has a unique , ebullient star presence , a man who embraces life so unselfconsciously that he becomes vulnerable to all kinds of suffering and heartache ( he endures masochistic megadoses of violence here ) . The sequence in which Chow's Mark avenges his betrayed best friend --- by blasting his way into , and then out of , a Chinese restaurant , twin .45s blazing --- is a swashbuckling standout. Woo's film technique may have been more polished in later efforts , but Tomorrow has a direct emotional power that is still unique. Kung fu star of the 1970s , Ti Lung is also terrific here as the 40ish established mobster , relied upon by all , who allows conflicting loyalties toward Mark and toward his younger brother , now a cop , to undermine the stability of his position. -- David Chute</DIV></DIV>

Jane's flight on Cloud Nine comes to a flaming crash when she learns that Renato is married and the father of a large family. Picking herself up and dusting herself off , Jane is determined to keep her romance alive , and hang the consequences. She ultimately does what's best for everyone , and heads back to Ohio , wistfully clutching to the memory of the happiest summer of life.

In this 1999 movie , Jeff Bridges plays Lyle , a slick Kentucky horse breeder about to make a career - topping sale of a prospective Derby winner ( the title character , as it were ) . Lyle's youthful crony , Vinnie ( Nick Nolte at his scuzziest ), phones in from Rancho Cucamonga , California , with a blackmail threat -- he'll reveal their shared secret unless Lyle helps him sort out his goofy love life. Lyle drops everything and heads west ; Vinnie promptly steals Lyle's car , and essentially his identity , and drives east. Lyle's well - oiled existence starts coming apart ; Vinnie meanwhile cleans up his act and struts his stuff among the racing set. Oh , the irony of it all. In his filmmaking debut , British theater director Matthew Warchus strains to "cinematize" the play. This mostly means relentless crosscutting , with not only Lyle's and Vinnie's journeys being overlapped , but also fragmentary flashbacks in which the teenage Lyle , Vinnie , and Lyle's haunted wife ( Sharon Stone ) are played by Liam Waite , Shawn Hatosy , and Kimberly Williams. Only Albert Finney , as a racing official implicated in their old scam , appears in both time frames -- with unintentionally grotesque results. The complicated editing can't conceal that there's nothing complex , or compelling , about the characters' sins. Stone doesn't show up till the third act ( a ploy that worked better onstage ), and is outshone by the always - intriguing Catherine Keener playing the sweet - natured dim bulb who has lately won Vinnie's heart. Back - to - back Oscar winner John Toll photographed. -- Richard T. Jameson</DIV></DIV>

We're the best in the world at everything!" Unfortunately , living peacefully is not as easy as it seems. Though Ralph is named chief , Jack and the choristers quickly form a clique of their own , using the ever - effective political promise of fun rather than responsibility to draw converts. Director Peter Brook draws some excellent performances out of his young cast ; the moment when Ralph realizes that even if he blows the conch for a meeting people might not come is an excruciating one.

It is a relatively simple , uncomplicated story of a callow young Russian conscript ( Vladimir Ivashov ) who yearns for home and hearth during World War II. Unfortunately , only those who have committed a conspicuously heroic act are being honored with liberty. Almost in spite of himself , the boy becomes a battlefield hero , and as a result is allowed to visit his family. En route to his home , the boy uses up much of his valuable leave time through his efforts to help others. He finally gets to see his mother for a few precious moments before being called back to active duty. At the risk of sounding snobbish , we advise that you see Ballad of a Soldier in a subtitled print.

Farrell convinces Mundson to hire him as casino manager , but is shocked when Mundson introduces his new bride , and Farrell's old flame , Gilda ( Rita Hayworth ) .Though Farrell is unwavering in his loyalty to his employer , and he and Gilda treat each other with contempt , Mundson realizes that the torch never died for either of the former lovers. Ordered to guard Gilda , Farrell tries to convince himself that he's protecting Mundson's interests , but Gilda sees through his self - deception. Meanwhile , Mundson reveals to Farrell that his primary business is control of an international tungsten cartel that he plans to use to further his fascist ends. With the police closing in on the cartel , Mundson fakes his death , apparently leaving Gilda and Farrell free to marry. They do so : Gilda for love , but Farrell to punish her for being unfaithful to Mundson. When Mundson returns to kill them , it is he who dies , thereby freeing the lovers to apologize to each other and return to the U.S. Charles Vidor's Gilda is a voyeuristic film noir treat that engages the viewer in a complex web of sado - masochistic triangles. When , for example , Gilda performs her signature number , Put the Blame on Mame , she is not simply enraging both Mundson and Farrell with her open sexuality , she is also crying out in pain for the love she is being denied.~ Steve Press , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

For the kids , the political schism means greater freedom , and the kids find pleasure in biking , talking , and falling in love. But they cannot ignore the war forever.</DIV></DIV>

But this relaxed picture , made near the end of Hawks's marvelous career , still shows the steady , sure hand of a master. Hawks reunites with John Wayne , playing a hired gun mixed up in a range war ; Robert Mitchum is Wayne's old pal , now a sheriff in the midst of a hopeless drunken bender. James Caan , in one of his first sizable roles , plays a kid who can't shoot straight and wears a funny hat ( every character in the movie makes fun of this hat ) . As the plot moves along , it begins to resemble Rio Bravo rather closely ( "I steal from myself all the time , " Hawks was fond of admitting ) . But in El Dorado the heroes are a bit older , their powers a bit weaker ; at the end Wayne must revert to a bit of subterfuge in order to get the drop on the steely gunslinger ( ice - cold Christopher George ) he needs to put down. As relaxed as the movie is , Hawks and Wayne and company are in good spirits , with plenty of broad humor and easy camaraderie on display. Hawks and Wayne would make just one more film , the disappointing Rio Lobo , before ending their fruitful partnership. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

Black Robe , which was directed by Bruce Beresford , a director who gave the world the finest film of the early '80s Australian new wave , Breaker Morant , and who continually collides cultures and ethnicity in his films ( Mister Johnson , Driving Miss Daisy ), matches and surpasses the Costner epic as an expertly crafted , brutal saga of redemption and salvation. In 1634 a young French Jesuit missionary is assigned to trek 1 , 500 miles through the New France wilderness to a mission settled in Huron Indian country. Black Robe chronicles the journey of Father Laforgue ( Lothaire Blutheau ) as he leaves his Jesuit brothers and , with the aid of a young translator and guide , Daniel ( Aden Young ), and eight canoes of Algonquin Indians , moves into the uncompromising Canadian northern territory on a die - hard mission to convert the natives. Mixing elements of Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans and Roland Joff�'s The Mission , Beresford offers a restless tale of Laforgue's conflicted faith juxtaposed against the sublime spiritual harmony with the land that the Huron and Algonquin already hold. Black Robe dances to its own drummer and is tuned into the precarious balance between nature's mystery and spirit and the strident , unyielding religious ethic. The cinematography by Peter James is relentlessly cruel and bleak , but it absolutely conveys the obstacles that face the idealistic and blind young priest , who by the end , has faced his own awakening. The film also features one of the late , great composer Georges Delerue's most noble scores. -- Paula Nechak</DIV></DIV>

Breaking with the standard romantic spin on this legend , Bresson offers us a selfish , ruthless Lancelot , no better than the other grubby nobles who seek but fail to find the Holy Grail. Returning from his futile mission , Lancelot callously renews his affair with King Arthur's Guenevere , who likewise is depicted in less than sympathetic terms. Expectedly , the dream of Camelot is dashed to bits ; Bresson argues that Camelot was never any more than a dream -- or rather , a delusion. The mudcaked cinematography of Pasqualino de Santis adds to the iconoclastic flavor of Lancelot of the Lake.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

He's an outlaw named Lightning Jack Kane who's quick on the draw but not terribly bright. Jack's gang gets wiped out , leaving him to continue his bank robbing career alone... until , by chance , he takes hostage a young mute ( Cuba Gooding Jr. ) who decides he'd rather team up with Jack than be a put - upon store clerk for the rest of his life. Against his better judgment , Jack agrees , and they embark on a series of criminal escapades , bonding over bank heists , bar fights , jailbreaks , and women. The always lovely and charming Beverly D'Angelo plays Lana , a dance hall girl who's madly in love with Jack. Gooding is his usual exuberant self , even without words , and Paul Hogan is Paul Hogan. If you're a fan of his , you'll enjoy this movie , and if you're not , you probably aren't reading this review in the first place. Lightning Jack doesn't offer much in the way of historical recreation ; this is a Disney - style old West , with women's underclothes that look like they came out of a Victoria's Secret catalog and some pretty 1990's haircuts. But the movie rambles along amiably. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

A gifted cross between Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise , Gorham effortlessly carries this touching story of a young man's struggle to adapt and thrive in a completely foreign land. He may look like a bar of soap , standing in his suit and tie against the lush palms and shimmering waters of his new surroundings ; but as daily island living hits Groberg with death , disease , and natural disaster , this missionary's determination and courage shine through. Heartfelt letters Gorham writes to his true love ( sweetly portrayed by Anne Hathaway ) and her candid replies underscore profound -- or profoundly normal -- events and impressions the two experience while apart. It's an uplifting , tear - invoking family drama that benefits even more from fine acting , artful direction , and an Academy Award - winning producer ( Gerald R. Molen , Schindler's List ) .

But when an evil corporation uses a super - ho named Ireenie ( Jennifer Coolidge from Best in Show and Legally Blonde ) to steal this magic belt , Pootie must find himself again. In the title role , Lance Crouther glides through the movie like Isaac Hayes's skinny younger brother , while Chris Rock lends his trademark bark to multiple roles , including Pootie's father.

Meadows is not much of a thief. Indeed , in his late teens , he is not much of a man at all. His great crime was to try to steal forty dollars from the general's wife's pet charity. For this , he's been sentenced to eight years behind bars. At first , Buddusky and Mulhall view the journey as a paid vacation , but their holiday spirits are quickly depressed by the prisoner , who looks prepared to break into tears at any moment.

The film starts with a heated argument between two men , and when the elder is found dead with a knife in his chest the younger man is arrested and revealed to be his son. The story begins in flashback : the father , Dreverhaven ( Jan Decleir from Antonia's Line ), is a fearless Scrooge - like moneylender who has cold - heartedly built his fortune by collecting debts and foreclosing on the poor. His son , Katadreuffe ( Fedja van Huet ), is the offspring of a single night's passion with his housekeeper -- in an interesting twist he hounds her to marry him , and she leaves with the boy to raise him on her own. When she dies , father and son become locked in a fascinating battle : as Katadreuffe finds him calling in the law , Dreverhaven buys up his debts and attempts to drive him into bankruptcy. Katadreuffe eagerly takes up every challenge his father throws at him in a perverse show of strength and filial defiance. Adapted by first - time director Mike Van Diem from the 1938 novel by Ferdinand Bordewijk , this handsome epic is assured from the first frame , and excellent performances by Decleir ( whose imposing Dreverhaven seems to tower over all by will as much as by size ) and van Huet bring to life this study of two tortured psyches whose love emerges only through conflict and competition. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

Practicing his patter in his basement with cardboard cut - outs of his favorite celebrities , mediocre aspiring comedian Rupert Pupkin ( Robert De Niro ) believes that one appearance on the evening talk show of the Johnny Carson - esque Jerry Langford ( Jerry Lewis ) will be his ticket to stardom. After he helps Jerry escape the advances of amorous fan Masha ( Sandra Bernhard ), Rupert takes Jerry's patronizing brush - off as a true promise for an audition and begins haunting Jerry's office. Provoked by Masha's needling and a rejection from Jerry's smooth production exec Cathy Long ( Shelley Hack ), Rupert makes a disastrous trip to Jerry's country house with embarrassed date Rita ( Diahnne Abbott ), then hatches an even more outlandish scheme to get ahead. With Masha's help , Rupert kidnaps Jerry and demands as ransom the TV appearance that he believes will turn his fantasy into reality.~ Lucia Bozzola , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Thirty years ago , she abruptly disappeared from the screen and from public view. One of her greatest admirers , Genya Tachibana , is a documentary filmmaker who has traveled to the isolated mountain lodge where she makes her home to interview her. There , he presents her with an old key , and as if the key had opened a door to her memories , Chiyoko starts telling the story of her life , interweaving moments from her past and future and passing through the boundary between reality and the movies that had made up so much of her life.As her story unfolds , Chiyoko seems to transcend time and space , traveling freely through the corridors of fictional movies and reality. Chiyoko was born when the Great Earthquake hit Tokyo in 1923 , as war is looming in Imperial Japan. At a very young age , she is discovered as an actress , and soon becomes one of Japan's most popular stars. Over the course of her career , her movies and her roles encompass all the epochs of Japanese history , bringing her and her audience back more than five hundred years , and then moving chronologically through the centuries to the present and beyond. Chiyoko's first major role finds her in the Warring States Period of the 15th and 16th centuries , where we see her as a princess in a burning castle tower. Her movies swiftly carry her into the Edo Period ( 1603 - 1868 ), when the Shogun ruled the country. In one moment , she is portraying a ninja fighting against samurais , but another role transforms her into an innocent local girl who confronts a group of elite samurai guards. She runs away , only to find herself being arrested in a scene set against the backdrop of Japan's Meiji Period ( 1868 - 1912 ), at the dawn of a new era when the power of the Emperor was restored. Chiyoko escapes , but in her next movie , we find her in the pre - World War II and war - torn decades of the Showa Period ( 1912 - 1945 ) . As Chiyoko chronicles her life and career , we come to learn that not only was Chiyoko an icon of the Japanese cinema , but her roles also represented feminine icons of Japanese history.Through each role and in every era , Chiyoko has only one wish - to see her first love , an injured artist and painter she had helped escape from government authorities as a girl. Chiyoko risks everything to hide the mysterious stranger in her storage house. Before she can learn his identity and mission , however , he leaves her...but not before he presents her with the all - important key. From that moment on , she determinedly keeps running - in real life , and in her movies - believing that they will meet again and she will learn the true meaning of the key.As her identity changes with each movie role , so does that of her true love. Yet Chiyoko keeps running after him through the passages of time. Wherever she goes , she also must battle her enemies : a man with a scar and a rival actress , both of whom continue to change their appearances according to the time periods and settings of the movies that make up Chiyoko's life.The two filmmakers , Genya Tachibana and his cameraman Kyoji Ida , become so immersed in Chiyoko's story that they are amazed to find themselves actually witnessing the events as she describes them. To the astonishment of his cameraman , Tachibana is not only present , but has become a character in her movies , appearing to rescue her whenever she is in danger. Chiyoko keeps running through the centuries in pursuit of the "love of her life , " as if she had lived for 1000 years. In what appears to be her final role , seemingly in the future , she rockets to the moon , leaving us to wonder what adventures await her there. -- © Go Fish Pictures</DIV></DIV>

At the center of these events are two young , American friends - one Jewish , the other Arab. The film is told from the alternating viewpoints of the Jews , Arabs and Brits , all of whom collide in their fight for the control of Jerusalem while bringing to the forefront themes of courage , terrorism , deprivation , politics and a strong sense of morality. Their involvement takes them from the streets of New York to The Holy Land , where they risk their lives - making incredible sacrifices along the way - to fight for what they believe in , as the city of their dreams teeters on the brink of destruction. The film , based on historical accounts from the best - selling novel O Jerusalem , written by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre , offers a rich background to an explosive conflict that echoes the situation in the Middle East today.</DIV></DIV>

Sarah Polley ( Go , The Sweet Hereafter ) plays Beatrice , a naive young reporter who is sent by a huge media conglomerate to investigate the disappearance of a camera crew in Iceland. Eventually she finds an immortal but depressed and alcoholic monster ( Robert John Burke ) who wants nothing more than to die. Beatrice agrees to help him find the one man who can kill him , and she draws the monster out into an invasive media spotlight. No Such Thing is maybe too ambitious ; the story tackles not just the media and world unrest , but even the history of mankind. Still , like most of Hartley's work , the movie remains uniquely engaging , a delicate mix of irony and sincerity. Also starring Helen Mirren ( Gosford Park ) and Julie Christie ( Afterglow ) . -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

What they lack in speed and agility , they more than make up for in sheer single - minded determination. Im - Ho - Tep is a case in point. He's an ancient Egyptian priest , cursed for his terrible crimes against the gods. A team of British archaeologists digs up his sarcophagus , along with a box inscribed with a warning that opening it will unleash death and destruction. You'll never guess what they do. Once freed , Im - Ho - Tep takes on the appropriately evil alias Ardath Bey and gets to the task of resurrecting his ancient lover -- which will , of course , require a living human surrogate. While the premise may sound formulaic , The Mummy in fact turns out to be bracingly weird , relying on atmospheric creepiness rather than on jump - out - and - scare - you effects. Boris Karloff gives a terrific performance as Im - Ho - Tep. He has all the malevolence the film requires , but also manages subtler touches ; the expression in his eyes as he is wrapped in preparation for being buried alive is absolutely chilling. Instead of forcing him to do all the tedious shambling around that so many mummies resort to , the filmmakers have wisely given Im - Ho - Tep / Ardath Bey a nearly living appearance once he's cleaned up and has a few psychic powers to boot , making him a potent adversary. Stock up on ace bandages and prepare for a good spooky evening. -- Ali Davis</DIV></DIV>

Jerry informs Lucy that he's taking a vacation alone in Florida ; instead , he holes up with his buddies and plays poker for a week ( while sitting under a sun lamp so he'll have an appropriate tan ) . Lucy concludes that Jerry was never in Florida just as Jerry discovers that Lucy was spending her time with Armand Duvalle ( Alex D'Arcy ), a handsome voice teacher. Both Jerry and Lucy believe the other was unfaithful , so they agree to a trial divorce , with a bitter battle fought over custody of Mr. Smith , the dog ( Lucy gets the dog , but Jerry has visitation rights ) . Determined to make Jerry jealous , Lucy continues keeping company with Armand while also dating Daniel Leeson ( Ralph Bellamy ), a wealthy oil man from Oklahoma. Convinced that turnabout is fair play , Jerry starts going out with Dixie Belle Lee ( Joyce Compton ), a brassy nightclub singer , as well as socialite Barbara Vance ( Molly Lamont ) . However , Lucy has belatedly decided that she wants Jerry back , and she hatches a plan to win him back by making a spectacle of herself at a party. The Awful Truth was based on a play which had been filmed twice before , but McCarey gave his superb comic cast free reign to improvise and add new business , and the results were splendid ; you haven't lived until you've heard Irene Dunne attempt to sing Home on the Range. ~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Though he initially follows his handler's instructions , Gilliam soon starts handling speeches in his own brazen , outspoken way , which starts to turn the tide -- which upsets the party leaders who chose him , since they expected him to lose. While Head of State doesn't quite have the razor wit that Rock wields in his stand - up routine , it has a sharper edge than just about any other political satire in recent memory. Rock bursts with charisma , and his supporting cast ( including Lynn Whitfield , Dylan Baker , Robin Givens , and especially Bernie Mac as Gilliam's brother and running mate ) provide solid comic support. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

In 1959 in Istanbul , Fanis Iakovidis is a young boy growing up in the multi - cultural city , where Greeks and Turks live side by side. Fanis' granddad , spice shop owner Vasilis , tells him that life , like food , requires salt , too and impregnates him with a broad , non - denominational outlook tinged with the mystical. Ignorant of growing political tensions , Fanis is heartbroken when the family is split up. As a Greek citizen , Fanis' father has his property confiscated and moves with his wife and Fanis to Athens ; old Vasilis stays in his beloved Istanbul. Back in Greece , the family suffers the initial irony of being treated as de facto Turks. Flash forward to Athens in 1964 , and Fanis is showing real talent as a cook , much to the comic dismay of his parents and teachers who fear he may be turning into a homosexual. Fanis still misses his grandfather , and even his father notes that Greece was much more beautiful in our minds than what we found here. The last segment is set in the present day , as the mature Fanis , a respected astrophysics prof , finally returns to Istanbul , where his granddad is mortally ill.</DIV></DIV>

Art Carney stars as a nearly retired detective who suddenly finds himself caught up in two seemingly separate cases. One involves the murder of his former partner ( Howard Duff ); the other entangles him with a flaky post - hippie ( Lily Tomlin ), who wants him to find her missing cat. The two cases eventually dovetail , but the plot -- which leads them to a Hollywood crime bigwig played by the affable Eugene Roche -- is of less interest than the almost magical chemistry between the crotchety Carney and the wonderfully off - the - wall Tomlin. The perfect film for anyone who likes their mysteries in the Dashiell Hammett / Raymond Chandler mode. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

While the infant King of England awaits his rightful place as leader of the British Empire , his rule is usurped by Roderick ( Cecil Parker ), an evil pretender to the throne. Brave rebel leader The Black Fox ( Edward Ashley ) intends to remove Roderick from the palace and bring the crown back to its true owner , but in the meantime the baby king needs to be looked after , which is the job of a man named Hawkins ( Kaye ) . The Black Fox travels with the little king and his rebels as they search for the key to a secret tunnel that will allow them passage into the castle. Maid Jean ( Glynis Johns ), one of the rebels , meets a man en route to the Castle who is to be Roderick's new jester. The rebels quickly hatch a plan : detain the jester and send Hawkins in his place ; the king can then find the key and initiate the overthrow. Hawkins is able to persuade Roderick and his men that he is indeed a jester , but his espionage work gets complicated when Princess Gwendolyn ( Angela Lansbury ) falls in love with him , and he runs afoul of Sir Ravenhurst ( Basil Rathbone ), the evil genius behind Roderick. Court Jester features Kaye's famous Pellet with the Poison routine.~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Today , it is a vivid , dramatic and pervasive presence in all our lives. Like the Church , the Monarchy and the Communist Party in other times and places , the corporation is today's dominant institution. But history humbles dominant institutions. All have been crushed , belittled or absorbed into some new order. The corporation is unlikely to be the first institution to defy history. Based on Joel Bakan's soon - to - be - published book , "The Corporation : The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power , " this documentary is a timely , critical inquiry that examines the very nature of the corporation - its inner workings , curious history , controversial impacts and possible futures. We begin by learning that under the law , corporations have all the rights and yet few of the responsibilities of people. By viewing the behavior of the corporation through the prism of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( or DSM III , the gold standard of psychiatric evaluation ) the filmmakers discover that if the corporation were indeed a person , the person would be considered a psychopath. Featuring candid interviews with CEOs , whistle - blowers , brokers , gurus , spies , players , pawns and pundits , the chronicle charts the spectacular rise of an institution aimed at achieving specific economic goals as it also recounts victories against this seemingly invincible force. Once you see it , you may find yourself thinking twice about what you eat , what you wear , what you watch and what you read.</DIV></DIV>

With a smart , tough little script by Shelagh Delaney , Mike Newell's noir - ish film is a dissection of the human frustration and complex class issues surrounding her crime. Miranda Richardson , looking like some delicious , chilled confection , plays Ellis , the hostess to a "glorified brothel" who plans for a better life with her young son until she meets David Blakely ( a young , gorgeous Rupert Everett ), the wealthy ne'er - do - well whose fitful attentions chip away her armor. Their vicious attraction and its constant tug - of - war lose some dramatic pull as the story heads toward its inevitable climax , but Richardson's performance holds your attention. She plays the entire film in a kind of stunned ardor , a feisty little animal caught in the headlights of Everett's sullen magnetism. By the time she's plugging bullets into his body , she's already hit you a few time with her heated , fatal despair. -- Steve Wiecking</DIV></DIV>

Hughes would produce a paean to World War I flying aces like Hell's Angels. Given Hughes' comparative inexperience as a moviemaker , however , everyone was taken slightly aback that the finished film was as good as it was. The very American Ben Lyon and James Hall play ( respectively ) Monte and Roy Rutledge , a couple of British brothers who drop out of Oxford to join the British Royal Flying Corps. Several early scenes establish Lyon and Hall's romantic rivalry over two - timing socialite Helen ( Jean Harlow ) . While flying a dangerous bombing mission over Germany , the brothers are shot down. The commandant ( Lucien Prival ), who'd earlier been cuckolded by one of the brothers , savors his opportunity for revenge. He offers the boys their freedom if they'll reveal the time of the next British attack ; if they don't cooperate , they face unspeakable consequences. Roy , driven mad by his combat experiences , is about to tell all when he is shot and killed by Monte. The latter is himself condemned to a firing squad by the disgruntled commandant -- who , it is implied , will soon meet his own doom at the hands of the British bombers. Nobody really cares about this hoary old plot , however ; Hell's Angels culls most of its strength from its crackerjack aerial sequences. The highlight is a Zeppelin raid over London , one of the most hauntingly effective sequences ever put on film. From the first ghost - like appearance of the Zeppelin breaking through the clouds , to the self - sacrificing behavior of the German crew members as they jump to their deaths rather than provide excess weight , this is a scene that lingers in the memory far longer than all that good - of - the - service nonsense in the finale. Also worth noting is the star - making appearance of Jean Harlow. When Hell's Angels was begun as a silent film , Norwegian actress Greta Nissen played the female lead. During the switchover to sound , producer Hughes decided that her accent was at odds with her characterization , so he reshot her scenes with his latest discovery , Harlow. While she appears awkward in some of her scenes , there's no clumsiness whatsoever in her delivery of the classic line about slipping into something more comfortable. Originally , Marshall Neilan was signed to direct the film , but became so rattled by Howard Hughes' interference that he handed the reins to Hughes himself , who was in turn given an uncredited assist by Luther Reed. Also ignored in the film's credits are the dialogue contributions by future Frankenstein director James Whale , who'd been hired as the film's English - dialect coach. Modern audiences expecting a musty museum piece are generally surprised by Hell's Angels' high entertainment content : they are also startled by the pre - code frankness of the dialogue , with phrases like The hell with you bandied about with reckless abandon. In recent years , archivists have restored the film's two - color Technicolor sequence , providing us with our only color glimpses of the radiant Jean Harlow.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Now critics refer to it as a winning , offbeat classic. What took 'em so long? Probably the fact that director Roger Spottiswoode ( Tomorrow Never Dies ) and screenwriter Ron Shelton ( Bull Durham ) were chasing something very elusive : a cockeyed , scatological look at delayed glory. Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee , a meek bank VP in Taft , California , who daily relives the humiliation of a bobbled pass in the game against Bakersfield. Not content to live out his days as "Butterfingers" Dundee , Jack hits on a plan to "rewrite history" by restaging the Big Game. Taft's now - over - the - hill quarterback , Reno Hightower ( Kurt Russell ), reluctantly goes along with the harebrained scheme to redeem his buddy. The guys' wives ( Holly Palance and Pamela Reed ) shake their heads and play along. At once zany , sweet , and nostalgic , this small - town chronicle strives for , and achieves , folk - legend status. "Casey at the Bat" in shoulder pads , anyone? -- Glenn Lovell</DIV></DIV>

Running to get help , he is spotted by a group of local girls who report him to the police as the murderer fleeing the scene. Taken in for questioning , Tisdall quickly realizes that as a stranger in town with circumstantial evidence pointing to him , he has little chance of beating the murder rap. His escape gives him an opportunity to prove his innocence , and not unlike the Hannay character in THE 39 STEPS , he finds a young woman who will believe his story. The woman ( Nova Pillbeam ), however , proves to be the daugher of the local police constable , which generates a humorous set of complications. Nonetheless , the police and local authorities are not taking the escaped murderer lightly. The ensuing manhunt tests the wills of the father and daughter as well as the resolve of the innocent man. The film is based on the novel A SHILLING FOR CANDLES by Josephine Tey.</DIV></DIV>

Silverstone plays Emily , a spoiled rich girl who has everything but her father's affection , so she decides to stage her own kidnapping to see if dad will come to his senses and appreciate the daughter he so blindly disregards. But when Emily locks herself in the trunk of her own car , she's surprised when the car is stolen by Vincent ( Benicio Del Toro , from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ), a professional car thief whose partner ( Harry Connick Jr. ) has misplaced $200 , 000 of the Mob's money. Christopher Walken stars as Emily's "Uncle Ray , " who's hot on her trail as she goes on the lam with Vincent. It's not the meandering plot that matters so much as the funny dialogue between Silverstone and Del Toro , who steals his scenes with a smoky mumble and easygoing charm. This one is mostly for Alicia fans , but the film has got enough good laughs and low - key appeal to make it a home - video sleeper. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

That doesn't mean it's a bad movie , but it does make it a mildly disappointing one , and it illustrates the hazards of crafting a film to fit the persona of its leading man. In this case , you've got Wesley Snipes , a young , savvy man of action , playing a Washington , D.C. , police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a woman in the White House. The president's son is a prime suspect , but there's a cover - up underway that forces Snipes to intensify his investigation beyond normal parameters. For a while at least , this makes Murder at 1600 a sharp and interesting film , and while the national security advisor ( Alan Alda ) seems highly cooperative ( but don't be so sure ), Snipes meets a secret service member ( Diane Lane ) who shares his belief in a high - level conspiracy. Unfortunately , that's when the film takes a downward plunge , resorting to a series of thriller clich�s including an unlikely chase through secret tunnels beneath the White House. We're not suggesting this couldn't happen , but it's the kind of thing you typically see in movies that have run out of original ideas before they're over. Kinda makes you want to watch Absolute Power again , doesn't it? -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Diamond , is one of the legendary filmmaker's surlier efforts. Were it not for the star - making performance of Walter Matthau ( which won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor ), it might not have registered so strongly with audiences. Shot in a grimy black and white , the story begins as CBS cameraman Harry Hinkle ( Jack Lemmon ) is injured on the sidelines of a football game when Cleveland Browns star Boom Boom Jackson ( Ron Rich ) accidentally barrels into him. Hinkle's all right , but his ambulance - chasing brother - in - law William Gingrich ( Matthau ), also known as "Whiplash Willie , " has a lawsuit filed before Hinkle even wakes up at the hospital. Hinkle is reluctant to join in on the scheme , which involves staying in a wheelchair , until he realizes it may bring his ex - wife ( Judi West ) back , even though her eyes practically flash dollar signs at the thought of his case's settlement potential. Working on Hinkle's conscience , however , is a burgeoning friendship with Jackson , who feels horrible about the incident. Not as sure - footed or as brazenly funny as many other Wilder efforts , the film nevertheless boasts a comic turn by Matthau that is deliciously conniving and endlessly inventive. Wilder , Hollywood's most caustically funny blend of pessimist and optimist , doesn't even aim for balance here. He clearly loves Matthau's character above all others and lets him run the show. The Lemmon and Matthau franchise began here and would go on to include their reteaming for Wilder's films The Front Page and Buddy Buddy. -- Robert Abele</DIV></DIV>

James Horner's rollicking music score certainly helps , as does the epic - scale CinemaScope photography of the breathtaking Italian landscapes. The costumes and extravagant production design are also great to look at , and much of Derek Meddings's visual effects work still looks striking. Freddie Jones stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast as the wise Ynyr , while the two romantic leads , Ken Marshall as Prince Colwyn and Lysette Anthony ( with an overdubbed American voice ) as Princess Lyssa , are mere formalities on which to hang the plot. The all - British supporting cast includes Todd Carty , Bernard Bresslaw , Robbie Coltrane , Liam Neeson , and the gorgeous Francesca Annis. If you feel the need for some escapist sword - and - sorcery fantasy , then Krull delivers in full measure. -- Mark Walker</DIV></DIV>

He runs away from them ( finally ) and enters his third term facing trouble from more than one side : for using magic outside the school and from the news that a notorious criminal , serial killer Sirius Black , has escaped the wizard's prison at Azkaban and apparently is headed for Harry. The school calls in supernatural help against Black in the form of Dementors , but unusual things continue to put Harry in peril. He is thrown into a confusing panoply of shifting alliegences and shifting shapes where nobody is who or what they seem. Who is the real criminal? What is the real crime? Who is telling or knows the truth?</DIV></DIV>

One is boss of the garbage dumps , the other is boss of the cement factories , but both have problems with their offspring. Zarije's good - for - nothing son Matko plans a train heist that will finally bring him respect and wealth but is forced to ask help from Grga. He loses all in a double - cross by his partner , the manic , coke - snorting "businessman - patriot" Dadan , who demands that he pay the debt by marrying off his son Zare to Dadan's headstrong sister , Afrodita. Complicating the plot further , the innocent Zare has fallen for comely barmaid Ida , who soon initiates him into the mysteries of love. Frenetically paced and hilariously funny , Black Cat , White Cat builds to its uproarious climax , the arranged wedding of Zare and Afrodita , through a slapstick sequence of wild chases , exuberant parties , fake deaths , skullduggery , double - crosses , mishaps , and pratfalls. Its cinematography , as rich as the action , includes Fellini - esque scenes of pigs eating cars and the obligatory flocks of geese. The rousing sound track of Gypsy music adds to the folklore and fun. Actor Srdan Todorovic as the wild Dadan returns from director Emir Kusturica's earlier somber work , Underground , accompanied by an excellent cast , including many Gypsy non - professionals , who display an uncanny family resembance. A ribald , buoyant comedy , Black Cat , White Cat will lift your spirits and leave you dancing.</DIV></DIV>

She finds help at a sanitarium from a kind psychiatrist ( Claude Rains ), who turns her into a beautiful , confident woman. As a new person , she takes a pleasure cruise , where she meets Jerry ( Paul Henreid ), an architect trapped in an unhappy marriage , saddled with a troubled daughter. The two fall in love , but , of course , the romance is doomed. Yet their paths cross on occasion , and , despite their feelings , Charlotte finds satisfaction in helping Jerry's depressed child. The film will seem familiar to new viewers -- the campy style was the pattern for many tearjerkers to come , and its most famous line has been oft repeated ( "Don't ask for the moon -- we have the stars" ) . But the heartstrings are tugged , and as Paul Henreid chivalrously lights two cigarettes and hands one over to the doleful - eyed Davis , pull out the box of tissues -- you're gonna need 'em. -- Jenny Brown</DIV></DIV>

Christopher Lee removes the monstrous makeup from the earlier film and makes his entrance as an elegant , confident , altogether seductive Dracula , a frightening figure of flashing eyes and erotic allure. Peter Cushing , with his hawklike profile and piercing eyes , turns his rationalist intensity to Van Helsing : man of science as crusading vampire hunter. Director Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster make a few changes to Bram Stoker's tale ; gone are Renfield , Transylvania , howling wolves , and transformations into bats. The Count is an old - world aristocrat firmly ensconced in a castle in England and Van Helsing a crusading vampire hunter who plots his demise with an elaborate plan. This is the first film to really mine the erotic appeal of vampires : Dracula seduces Mina and Lucy like a devil tempting good to the dark side through sex -- more suggestive than explicit , but daring for 1958. Lee is electric as the ferocious Count , despite his limited screen time , and Cushing turns Van Helsing into a virtual swashbuckler of a hero , leaping and diving through the climax like an aging action hero. Cushing reprises his role in The Brides of Dracula , while Lee absented himself from the series until 1966's Dracula : Prince of Darkness. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

When her parents , Giancarlo and Agata , move from a seaside town in Tuscany to an ailing aunt's apartment in the big city , Caterina is ready for something new. Dad , a teacher in a tech school , has undisguised social ambitions and is delighted to see a list of famous last names attending his old alma mater , where Caterina will also be going. Her class is split between revolutionary no - globals and rich kids who parrot their parents' conservative ideas. Both sides try to bring the new girl into their sphere of influence. She's first drawn to Margherita , a mercurial hippie princess and soon falls in with the flighty Daniela and her circle of rich , cell phone totting mall - rats.

As the psychedelic San Francisco of the '60's began evolving into the gay San Francisco of the '70's , The Cockettes , a flamboyant ensemble of hippies ( women , gay men , and babies ) decked themselves out in gender - bending drag and glitter for a series of legendary midnight musicals at the Palace Theater. The Cockettes were founded by "Hibiscus , " a member of a commune that was dedicated to distributing free food and to creating free art and theater. The early shows were mostly non - narrative revues , with everybody making their own costumes , and creative spontaneity reigning supreme. But with "Pearls Over Shanghai" the Cockettes produced their first show with all - original script , music and lyrics. Combining grand spectacle with the awkwardness of a high school operetta , The Cockettes thrilled audiences as much with their unpredictability as with their triumphs.</DIV></DIV>

Zenovich had unprecedented access to several of the key players in the case , including the lawyers representing the case , the media covering it , and the unusually clear - eyed and candid victim. Unearthing a trove of telling footage from the past , and combining it with insightful interviews from today , she brings comprehension and clarity to events long clouded by myth and misconception. A thrilling examination of a trial that became the prototype for innumerable Hollywood courtroom scandals to follow , the film becomes a brilliant discourse on the attraction / repulsion that defines celebrity culture in contemporary America.</DIV></DIV>

It also caused major controversy by redefining violence in cinema and casting its criminal protagonists as sympathetic anti - heroes. Based loosely on the true exploits of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the 30s , the film begins as Clyde ( Beatty ) tries to steal the car of Bonnie Parker ( Faye Dunaway ) 's mother. Bonnie is excited by Clyde's outlaw demeanor , and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car , with Bonnie in tow , and their legendary crime spree begins. The two move from town to town , pulling off small heists , until they join up with Clyde's brother Buck ( Gene Hackman ), his shrill wife Blanche ( Estelle Parsons ), and a slow - witted gas station attendant named C.W. Moss ( Michael J. Pollard ) . The new gang robs a bank and Clyde is soon painted in the press as a Depression - era Robin Hood when he allows one bank customer to hold onto his money. Soon the police are on the gang's trail and they are constantly on the run , even kidnapping a Texas Ranger ( Denver Pyle ) and setting him adrift on a raft , handcuffed , after he spits in Bonnie's face when she kisses him. That same ranger leads a later raid on the gang that leaves Buck dying , Blanche captured , and both Clyde and Bonnie injured. The ever - loyal C.W. takes them to his father's house. C.W.'s father disaproves his son's affiliation with gangsters and enters a plea bargain with the Texas Rangers. A trap is set that ends in one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. The film made stars out of Beatty and Dunaway , and it also featured the screen debut of Gene Wilder as a mortician briefly captured by the gang. Its portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde as rebels who empathized with the poor working folks of the 1930s struck a chord with the counterculture of the 1960s and helped generate a new , young audience for American movies that carried over into Hollywood's renewal of the 1970s. Its combination of sex and violence with dynamic stars , social relevance , a traditional Hollywood genre , and an appeal to hip young audiences set the pace for many American movies to come.~ Don Kaye , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Built around intimately - told personal stories of Hasidic and Orthodox Jews who are gay or lesbian , the film portrays a group of people who face a profound dilemma - how to reconcile their passionate love of Judaism and the Divine with the drastic Biblical prohibitions that forbid homosexuality. As the film unfolds , we meet a range of complex individuals - some hidden , some out - from the world's first openly gay Orthodox rabbi to closeted , married Hasidic gays and lesbians to those abandoned by religious families to Orthodox lesbian high - school sweethearts. Many have been tragically rejected and their pain is raw , yet with irony , humor and resilience , they love , care , struggle , and debate with a thousands - year old tradition.

Think of it as Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels by way of Bound. Susan Lynch and Rachel Weisz are Dorothy and Petula , gangster girlfriends desperate to escape the Scottish underworld of scumbags , violent gang bosses , and corrupt cops. The familiar details are all here -- a dead body that won't go away , an uneasy balance between sadistic violence and black humor , and a tightening web of conspiracies and revenge plots that converge in a messy climax. But director Bill Eagles and writer Simon Donald temper the runaway plotting and cutthroat conniving of alpha males with moments of female bonding and giggly girl talk. Unfortunately they never quite overcome the brutal misogyny inherent in the genre. Still , there's a real joy in seeing Petula's self confidence blossoming under Dorothy's encouragement and trust , and you can't help but want the giddy girlfriends to triumph over the big , bad underworld. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

Utilizing carefully selected excerpts from extraordinary and in some cases rarely - seen films , and told through the first - hand accounts of the directors , actors , writers , and producers , the film covers some of Hollywood's most important movies , including "The Mortal Storm , " "The Great Dictator , " "The Search , " "The Diary of Anne Frank , " "The Pawnbroker , " "Judgment at Nuremberg , " "Sophie's Choice , " and "Schindler's List." The film takes us from the American ambivalence and denial during the heyday of Nazism , through the silence of the post - war years , and into the present day. It asks hard questions : about the uneasy relationship between American popular culture and the Holocaust , about the responsibility of filmmakers in their portrayal of history , and about the power of film itself to affect the way we look at ourselves.</DIV></DIV>

What else to do but make a movie that shows off Dangerfield's alternately knowing and boorish humor? This may not be on the AFI list of great films , but it delivers laughs aplenty in its story of a rough - edged tycoon who made his fortune in clothes for the stout and tall and decides to attend college in order to be closer to his son ( Keith Gordon ) . There's not much plot , but lots of room for Dangerfield's one - line riffs.

Set in a seedy New Orleans summer , Down By Law details the meeting of three unlikely convicts and their just as unlikely escape. Zack ( Tom Waits ) is an out - of - work DJ who is accused of murder when a body is found in the trunk of a stolen car he was hired to drive across town. Jack ( John Lurie ) is a pimp set up for a fall by a competitor. These two sullen souls are locked in a cell with Roberto ( Roberto Benigni ), a cheerful Italian immigrant who happens to have killed a man. The chemistry between the members of this loosely bound team is fascinating : Zack and Jack are forever laughing at Roberto , yet they rely on his energy and good will to escape their dire situation. The three mismatched miscreants eventually bust out of jail and head into the Louisiana bayous. Tired and hungry , they separate to search for food : Waits goes one way , Lurie another , and the frightened Benigni decides to risk stepping into a ramshackle diner. Somehow or other , he winds up in the arms of gorgeous Italian girl Nicoletta Braschi -- and is even able to provide new clothes and escape routes for his astonished comrades! ~ John Voorhees , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Vaclav Neckar stars as an unambitious youth whose chief preoccupation is a wish for sex , but who secondarily sees the draw of joining the organized Resistance movement. The latter , however , would require energy and focus , and Neckar's character -- who does as little work as possible as an apprentice railway platform guard -- prefers the inertia of his small - town depot. Spending his time observing the philandering of an older guard , keeping clear of his wild - eyed boss , and flirting with the female conductor of a passing train , the young hero has his priorities in order but must deal with an increasing responsibility to a larger rebellion. The film has a nice mix of rural lethargy , surreal hints , and comic knowingness about the landscape of teenage ambivalence. Finally , there is something else : the shock of a confrontation between dreams and real - world obligation , particularly in a world gone mad through no fault of one's own. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Born to race cars , Speed is aggressive , instinctive and , most of all , fearless. His only real competition is the memory of the brother he idolized - the legendary Rex Racer - whose death in a race has left behind a legacy that Speed is driven to fulfill. Speed is loyal to the family racing business , led by his father , Pops Racer , the designer of Speed's thundering Mach 5. When Speed turns down a lucrative and tempting offer from Royalton Industries , he not only infuriates the company's maniacal owner but uncovers a terrible secret - some of the biggest races are being fixed by a handful of ruthless moguls who manipulate the top drivers to boost profits. If Speed won't drive for Royalton , Royalton will see to it that the Mach 5 never crosses another finish line. The only way for Speed to save his family's business and the sport he loves is to beat Royalton at his own game. With the support of his family and his loyal girlfriend , Trixie , Speed teams with his one - time rival - the mysterious Racer X - to win the race that had taken his brother's life : the death - defying , cross - country rally known as The Crucible.</DIV></DIV>

Mostly set in a teeming warren of private and performance spaces within a turn - of - the - century theater , the film follows the fluctuating fortunes of playwright Tuccio ( Turturro ), his lover - muse - leading lady ( Katherine Borowitz , Turturro's offscreen wife ), and their colorful company : Rufus Sewell and Georgina Cates , youthful , less wise projections of playwright and muse ; Ben Gazzara as a grizzled old thespian forgetful of the line between reality and performance ; Bill Irwin as the naive bit player who catches the hungry eye of Christopher Walken's deliciously over - the - top , acid - tongued critic ; Susan Sarandon as a calculatingly seductive diva fighting her age ; and commedia dell'arte types Aida Turturro and Leo Bassi. Tuccio's dying to get his play on the boards , but as theater owners Beverly D'Angelo ( she of the endearing overbite ) and Donal McCann ( late star of Irish cinema , and of John Huston's The Dead ) reasonably point out , his delicate fantasy about love and illusion lacks an ending. Zigzagging through Midsummer Night's Dream misunderstandings and misalliances , slipping seamlessly from mundane into artifice and back again , Illuminata wends its way toward Tuccio's bittersweet denouement. In Mac , his directorial debut , Turturro paid heartfelt tribute to his own blue - collar dad ; this sophomore effort ( cowritten with friend and fellow director Brandon Cole ) glows with warm affection for audiences , actors , and those who dream their plays. -- Kathleen Murphy</DIV></DIV>

A depiction of a young woman's coming of age in a brutalized time and place , the story is set in 1920 in County Cork , southern Ireland at the country home of Sir Richard Naylor and his wife , Lady Myra. The Naylors belong to the class of Anglo - Irish aristocracy known as the Ascendancy , whose way of life -- moneyed , graceful , essentially feudal -- is fast coming to a close. Behind the facade of set - piece dinners , tennis parties and army camp dances , all know that the end is approaching. When Sir Richard's niece , Lois , who is being courted by a captain in the British army , is lured by a menacingly playful and violent young man hiding on the Danielstown estate , class tensions arise and a fierce struggle for personal freedom ensues.</DIV></DIV>

Filmed on digital video over a year by filmmakers Joe and Harry Gantz ( HBO's Taxicab Confessions ), the film observes two couples and and a trio who partake in what is known by insiders as "The Lifestyle." Twentysomethings Calvin and Sarah opened up their relationship to Julie and include her as a permanent fixture to their practices. Married thirtysomething medical professionals James and Theresa spend their free time cruising bars and clubs in their R.V. looking for potential lovers , then discussing their experiences the day after. Southerners Shannon and Gerard met when he was 32 and she was 17 , married , then tried swinging when it was suggested by a marriage counselor. Though what is presented is fairly explicit , a minimal amount of sex is actually shown in Gantz's film. Instead , SEX WITH STRANGERS chooses to examine the manner in which swinging affects an otherwise committed relationship -- and the result appears to be determined by the emotional constitution of the participants. Calvin's emotional distance appears to be the undoing of sensitive Sarah , while James and Theresa could be an advertisement for The Lifestyle. Problems between Shannon and Gerard , however , appear to be beyond anything that any amount of additional partners could ever repair.</DIV></DIV>

Jacqueline du Pre was arguably the greatest prodigy of the 20th Century. She dazzled audiences around the world with the unbridled passion and beauty of her music. While her sister Hilary married and began a family at home , Jackie and her husband , the pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim , traveled and performed around the world. Although the couple was treated as musical royalty , the constant touring became a tremendous strain on Jackie who longed for the simpler life that her sister built.

Although it received a theatrical release , this four - hour depiction of the bloody Civil War battle was shot as a made - for - television film. But no taint of cheapness or shortcuts should stick to this magnificent picture ( well , except maybe for those phony - looking mustaches ) . Based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels , this film takes a refreshingly slow , thorough approach to the intricacies of battle. In ordinary circumstances , those intricacies might seem of importance only to fans of military strategy or Civil War enthusiasts , yet in Gettysburg they come across as the very stuff of life , death , and unexpected heroism. If the film has a problem , it's that it climaxes too early : the first long segment , detailing the struggle of a "civilian soldier , " Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain ( Jeff Daniels ), to hold his ground against long odds , is an enthralling piece of moviemaking. Daniels , in a heartbreaking performance , does his best film work. Other cast members include Tom Berenger , Sam Elliott , and Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. Richard Jordan , in his final role , gives a powerhouse performance as Confederate general Lewis A. Armistead. Oh , and you can also try to spot Ted Turner , whose company produced the film , as a Confederate soldier. Writer - director Ronald F. Maxwell seems inspired by the gravity of the battle ; long as it is , every moment of Gettysburg is informed by a nobility of purpose. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

And government secrecy is growing , vastly outpacing the circulation of open information. The statistics , as much as can be gathered , are staggering. In a single recent year , the United States government classified about five times the number of pages added to the Library of Congress ; the cost is about eight billion dollars a year -- just to keep secrets secret.Now , 70 years after the builders of the bomb created a national information security system and just a few years after 9 / 11 , a government secrecy crisis is looming. The combination of a declared war on terrorism and the curtailment of civil liberties sets the stage to ask some critical questions. When does security erode , rather than enhance , democracy? Can burying too much information actually undermine national security?Secrecy , the stylistically elegant and provocative new film by Robb Moss and Peter Galison , explores the hidden world of national security policy by examining the many implications of secrecy , both for government and individuals. Combining animation , installations , a mesmerizing score , and riveting interviews , the film takes us inside the inverted world of government secrecy as we share the experiences of lawyers , CIA analysts , and the ordinary people for whom secrecy becomes a matter of life and death. -- © Sundance Film Festival</DIV></DIV>

Allen plays Boris , a 19th century Russian who falls in love with his distant ( and married ) cousin Sonja ( Diane Keaton ) . Pressed into service with the Russian army during the war against Napoleon , Boris accidentally becomes a hero , then goes on to win a duel against a cuckolded husband ( Harold Gould ) . He returns to Sonja , hoping to settle down on the Steppes somewhere , but Sonja has become fired up with patriotic fervor , insisting that Boris join a plot to kill Napoleon. Intellectual in - jokes abound in Love and Death , and other gags are basic Allen one - liners ; for instance , after being congratulated for his lovemaking skills , Boris replies nonchalantly , I practice a lot when I'm alone. The pseudo - Russian ambience of Love and Death is comically enhanced by the Sergey Prokofiev compositions on the musical track.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Hustler was a raw and raunchy magazine that pushed the limits of American tolerance. Its publisher , a grade - school dropout and Kentucky redneck , was nobody's hero , but circumstance would cast him as the era's last crusader. It was a role that brought Larry Flynt both ruin and glory. Flynt becomes the unlikely champion of the First Amendment when he takes his fight against the Rev. Jerry Falwell all the way to the Supreme Court. Though his life , both public and private , was a tale told to America in soundbites and headlines , behind the scenes raged a story less familiar but no less striking : a story encompassing love and loss , redemption and despair , madness and healing.</DIV></DIV>

A young painter named Zhou Yu ( Gong Li , Raise the Red Lantern , Shanghai Triad ) falls headlong in love with a painfully shy poet , Chen Ching ( Tony Leung Ka - Fai , The Lover ) . Twice a week she takes the train to his town to be with him , even though he's bewildered by her near - obsessive passion. On the train , a wise - cracking veterinarian ( Sun Honglei ) pursues Zhou Yu , but she resists his emotional directness. Zhou Yu's Train bounces back and forth , not only between these two romances but also in time , to confusing effect. But there's something compelling about Zhou Yu's need to love the version of her lover that she holds in her mind , and that sustains the movie through its muddled moments. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

Interspersed with clips of Allen Ginsberg , Jack Kerouac , Neal Cassady , and William S. Burroughs are brilliant montages of clips that set the beats in the context of their times. The story of how the beats rebelled against American conformity in the 1950s is well known , of course , but this documentary manages to find fresh ways to relate their views on life and writing. Segments in which Johnny Depp , John Turturro , and Dennis Hopper portray , respectively , Kerouac , Ginsberg , and Burroughs may strike some as extraneous , but the good performances redeem their inclusion in the film. As befits the documentary's title , The Source devotes considerable attention to the influence of the beats , and interviews with such notables as Ken Kesey , Jerry Garcia , and Philip Glass , performance clips of Bob Dylan , and news footage from the 1960s establish how the sensibility of the writers trickled into all of society. This is not only a fine introduction to the beats , but those who already revere them will find the profusion of material contained it to be a delight. -- Robert J. McNamara</DIV></DIV>

Renato ( Ugo Tognazzi ) owns a popular nightclub and is the long - time lover of Zaza ( Michel Serrault ), a female impersonator who is the club's main attraction. Unfortunately , Renato's son Laurent ( Remy Laurent ) has told none of this to his future father - in - law , an important figure in a morally conservative political organization. Not wanting to ruin his son's chance of happiness , Renato agrees to pose as a straight man , but he finds his familiar habits , and those of the even more flamboyant Zaza , getting in the way at every turn. Zaza is the one who comes up with what he thinks is an ideal solution : he'll dress in drag and pose as Renato's wife. Naturally , the plan does not pan out as expected. La Cage aux Folles' pleasant , unthreatening comic sensibility attracted a large mainstream audience in both Europe and the United States , which was at the time unusual for a film with a homosexual theme. Indeed , the film was popular enough to inspire two remakes : a stage musical and , nearly two decades later , the Hollywood comedy The Birdcage with Robin Williams , Nathan Lane , and Gene Hackman.~ Judd Blaise , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

George Froeschel , James Hilton , Claudine West and Arthur Wimperis shared the Oscar for best screenplay. A glowing Greer Garson ( Best Actress ) commands the screen as Mrs. Miniver , a middle - class British housewife whose strength holds her family together as World War II literally hits their home. Walter Pidgeon as her architect husband seems to be the prototype for future TV dads in this affecting portrait of love -- familial and romantic -- during war. But the relationship between Mrs. Miniver's college - age son ( Richard Ney ) and the upper - crust Carol ( Best Supporting Actress Teresa Wright ) is filled with inherent drama -- as the war speeds up their young love , it also has the potential to doom it. The 1942 film , which also won for Best Picture and Best Director , is filled with colorful characters , snappy dialogue , and sensational plot twists. Although you spend much of the movie dreading that one of the Minivers will become a casualty of war , when it finally happens , it's not what you anticipated. Exactly what you'd expect from a legendary film that lives up to its billing.</DIV></DIV>

The swimming pool is filthy , broken glass litters the deck -- from one drink too many , sullen teenagers abound , and the lush vegetation surrounding the house looks as though it's about to make its move. Soon the crowded , rough - and - tumble domestic situation strains everyone's nerves ; repressed family mysteries are exposed and the tensions laid bare by the long , hot summer threaten to erupt into violence.</DIV></DIV>

It is said , in Estonia , heroes are those who wait , watch and act only when the time is right. In 1991 , after nearly 50 years of rule by a brutal Soviet occupation , the small Republic of Estonia , confronted their occupiers by announcing their independence to the world. Their charge heralded the collapse of the Soviet Union and the freedom of now - suddenly - former Soviet republics. And music played a pivotal role in these historical events. "The Singing Revolution" tells the story of one country's undeniable thirst for self - determination and its unshakable belief in what it means to be free -- to be Estonian.</DIV></DIV>

This is one question driving filmmaker Jon Else's ( The Day After Trinity ) latest documentary. Extending his fascination with the now - 60 - year history of nuclear power , Else's new film achieves something remarkable : it is art about artists contemplating the science of destruction. With infinite precision and formidable intelligence , Wonders Are Many unfolds as theatre director Peter Sellars and composer John Adams collaborate on Doctor Atomic , their fifth , and in many ways most complex , collaboration. The opera's subject is the 48 hours leading up to the first atomic - bomb test detonation in 1945. The film seamlessly combines footage of the making of the opera , candid interviews , and vivid archival material ( much of it recently declassified ) with journals and writings by J. Robert Oppenheimer and other members of the team that created the first atomic bomb. Though it largely concerns historical events , the film is startling in its immediacy.Art , as Sellars says in the film , is in part about discovering something new in what we already know. In documenting the act of creativity , both artistic and scientific , Wonders Are Many draws parallels between science and art , truth and beauty , and succeeds in finding wonder in the heart of darkness itself. -- © Sundance Film Festival</DIV></DIV>

The story involves the members of a fossil - hunting expedition down a dark tributary of the mist - shrouded Amazon , where they enter the domain of a prehistoric , amphibious "Gill Man" -- possibly the last of a species of fanged , clawed humanoids who may have evolved entirely underwater. Tranquilized , captured , and brought aboard , the creature still manages to revive and escape -- slaughtering several members of the team -- and abducts their sole female member ( Julie Adams ), spiriting her off to his mist - shrouded lair. This sparks the surviving crewmen to action -- particularly those who fancy carrying the girl off themselves. Director Jack Arnold makes excellent use of the tropical location , employing heavy mists and eerie jungle noises to create an atmosphere of nearly constant menace. The film's most effective element is certainly the monster itself , with his pulsating gills and fearsome webbed talons. The creature was played on land by stuntman Ben Chapman and underwater by champion swimmer Ricou Browning -- who was forced to hold his breath during long takes because the suit did not allow room for scuba gear. The end result was certainly worth the effort , proven in the famous scene where the Gill Man swims effortlessly beneath his female quarry in an eerie ballet -- a scene echoed much later by Steven Spielberg in the opening of Jaws.</DIV></DIV>

Moral conscience... or dark shadow? A manipulative , self - promoting , unscrupulous , amoral exploiter of misery as his critics claim , or a sensitive , empathetic defender of human dignity , even when the right to that dignity is claimed by individuals who have denied it to their victims? As a criminal lawyer , Verg�s is quite forthcoming about his general motivations. "Evil fascinates me , " he has said , "the more a man is accused the more interested I am." Verg�s contends that crime , or criminality , is what separates men from beasts. He professes great empathy for the world's "accused." For all his charm and urbanity , Verg�s represents a doorway to some very dark places indeed. For more than half - a - century , he has consorted with some of the most infamous figures of the post - WWII era , including Pol Pot , Mao Tse Tung , Slobodan Milosevic , Saddam Hussein , Carlos the Jackal , Klaus Barbie and other despots , tyrants , mass - murderers , torturers and terrorists of one political hue or another. Some were his clients , others his friends. In this controversial , ambiguous documentary , Barbet Schroeder lets his audience come to its own conclusions about the morality of Verg�s' work.</DIV></DIV>

It is a minimalist story of friendship , loss and alienation in the Bush era. For Mark , the weekend outing offers a respite from the pressure of his imminent fatherhood ; for Kurt , it is part of a long series of carefree adventures. As the hours progress and the landscape evolves , the twin seekers move through a range of subtle emotions , enacting a pilgrimage of mutual confusion , sudden insight , and recurring intimations of spiritual battle. When they arrive at their final destination , a hot spring in an old growth forest , they must either confront the divergent paths they have taken or somehow transcend their growing tensions in an act of forgiveness and mourning.</DIV></DIV>

Campbell Scott and Hope Davis , dentists both , have three kids and a pleasant life. Pleasant , but not exciting. When Scott realizes his wife is having an affair on the side , he's torn between caution and an outrageous inner voice urging drastic action. That voice is personified by Denis Leary , who pops up with unwelcome advice , like a nattering ghost ; needless to say , the role is a perfect fit for Leary's hostile persona. The blend of everyday realities -- especially a hilariously miserable five - day siege with stomach flu -- and Leary's surreal presence makes for a typically offbeat Rudolph offering. The smart script , after a Jane Smiley story , is by Craig Lucas. Indie stalwarts Scott and Davis both do subtle work -- they're as careful and scrupulous as the dentists they portray. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker , the story is designed to keep its central characters ( and the viewer ) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal -- an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense , and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. But Sea of Love is not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail - biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression in The Big Easy , and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career , matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue , but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most -- qualities that make Sea of Love one of the best films of its kind. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

The title characters are a pair of mice , Bernard and Miss Bianca. A little girl named Penny has been kidnapped by Miss Medusa. When the human law enforcement officials fail to locate the child , Bernard and Miss Bianca take over with the help of several colorful animal companions. In classic Disney tradition , the comedy element is offset by moments of genuine terror. Voices are provided by Bob Newhart ( Bernard ), Eva Gabor ( Miss Bianca ), Geraldine Page ( Madame Medusa ), Jim Fibber McGee Jordan , John McIntire , George Goober Lindsay , Joe Flynn ( who died in 1974 , not long into the four - year production ), and a host of others. It scored at the box office , more than compensating for the $8 million investment and the half - decade of work it took to complete the film. In fact , The Rescuers remains one of the most popular of the Disney cartoon films produced after the death of Uncle Walt. A heavily - computerized sequel , The Rescuers Down Under , appeared in 1990.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

People are seeking out farmers' markets , organic produce and good restaurants. At the same time , our food supply is increasingly controlled by multi - national corporations. Over the past 10 years , with the advent of genetic engineering and the massive expansion of pesticide companies , like Monsanto , into the seed business , the very nature of our food system has radically changed with potentially disastrous effects on our food security. Patenting of life is now permitted , no labeling of genetically modified organisms ( GMO's ) in food is required , research is conducted on these issues by universities beholden to the "agri - corps" who fund them , and the major regulatory agencies are run by former execs from these very companies. All the while , the average citizens remain blissfully unaware that they are eating GMO food and supporting the aggressive "corporatization' of their food sources. In fascinating and accessible terms , 'The Future of Food' illuminates the major issues ultimately affecting us all -- some surreal , some futuristic , many frightening. Yet , 'The Future of Food' is a hopeful film , featuring insightful and moving interviews with farmers , agriculture and business experts and policymakers. It sees a future in which an informed consumer can join the revolution by demanding natural , healthy food sources that insure environmental integrity.</DIV></DIV>

Maxwell has invested in this academically respectable 220 - minute historical pageant. In adapting Jeffrey Shaara's 1996 novel ( encompassing events of 1861 - 63 , specifically the Virginian battles of Bull Run , Fredericksburg , and Chancellorsville ), Maxwell sacrifices depth for scope while focusing on the devoutly religious "Stonewall" Jackson ( Stephen Lang ), whose Confederate campaigns endear him to Gen. Robert E. Lee ( Robert Duvall , giving the film's most subtle performance ) . Battles are impeccably recreated using 7 , 500 Civil War re - enactors and sanitized PG - 13 violence , their authenticity compromised by tasteful discretion and endless scenes of grandiloquent dialogue. Still , as the first part of a trilogy that ends with The Last Full Measure , this is a superbly crafted , instantly essential film for Civil War study. For all its misguided priorities , Gods and Generals is a noble effort , honoring faith and patriotism with the kind of reverence that has all but vanished from American film - but provides abundant proof that historical accuracy is no guarantee of great storytelling. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Presuming his wife to be dead , Grant remarries -- on the same day that his bedraggled spouse ( that's Dunne ) returns. Seems she's been stranded on a desert island for seven years ( with strapping hunk Randolph Scott , too ) . The moment Cary spots his resurrected wife , as an elevator door slides shut , is one of the many funny gags in this comedy , and the final sequence is memorably wacky. Awful Truth director Leo McCarey prepared the film , but it was directed by author Garson Kanin. The two stars are so adept at farce , and so effortless in conveying their characters' mutual affection , that the movie triumphs over the whopper of a plot device. It was supposed to be remade as the ill - fated Marilyn Monroe film Something's Got to Give , and ended up Move Over , Darling with Doris Day.</DIV></DIV>

In part one , Kiril ( Gr�goire Colin ), an Orthodox monk , encounters Zamira ( Labina Mitevska ), a Muslim from Albania. Zamira is frightened and has nowhere to go , so Kiril lets her stay in his cell , knowing that if the authorities find her , his peaceful life will be shattered. The second segment , set in London , concerns Anne ( Katrin Cartlidge ), married to stable but boring Nick ( Jay Villiers ) but enjoying an affair with Macedonian photographer Aleksander ( Rade Serbedzija ); Anne is trying to decide if she should stay with Nick or leave with Aleksander , before unexpected events make the decision for her. The conclusion follows Aleksander back to Macedonia ; while he's tired of photographing war , he finds no sanctuary in his home town , as Christians and Muslims wage war and he accidentally causes the death of innocent bystanders.

The documentary places the Bush Administration's false justifications for war in Iraq within the larger context of a two - decade struggle by neoconservatives to dramatically increase military spending in the wake of the Cold War , and to expand American power globally by means of military force. At the same time , the documentary argues that the Bush Administration has sold this radical and controversial plan for aggressive American military intervention by deliberately manipulating intelligence , political imagery , and the fears of the American people after 9 / 11.Narrated by Julian Bond , Hijacking Catastrophe features interviews with more than twenty prominent political observers , including Pentagon whistleblower Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski , who witnessed first - hand how the Bush Administration set up a sophisticated propaganda operation to link the anxieties generated by 9 / 11 to a pre - existing foreign policy agenda that included a preemptive war on Iraq.At its core , the film places the deceptions of the Bush Administration within the larger frame of questions seldom posed in the mainstream : What , exactly , is the agenda that drove the administration's pre - war deceptions? How is 9 / 11 being used to sell this agenda? And what are the stakes for America , Americans , and the world if this agenda succeeds in being fully implemented during a second Bush term?FEATURING INTERVIEWS WITH : Tariq Ali | Benjamin Barber | Medea Benjamin | Noam Chomsky | Kevin DanaherMark Danner | Shadia Drury | Michael Dyson | Daniel Ellsberg | Michael FrantiStan Goff | William Hartung | Robert Jensen | Chalmers Johnson | Jackson KatzMichael T.

Paul Mazursky ( Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice ) directs and Nick Nolte ( Cape Fear , The Prince of Tides ) stars as a vagrant who decides to kill himself by jumping into the swimming pool of rich wire - hanger magnate Richard Dreyfuss ( Jaws , The Goodbye Girl ) . Dreyfuss takes the bum into his dysfunctional home and soon Nolte and his murky past are causing everyone , from Dreyfuss's wife ( Bette Midler ) to his maid and mistress ( Elizabeth Pe�a ) to reexamine their own lives. Featuring a neurotic dog , an anorexic daughter , a sexually confused son , and Little Richard as a neighbor , this riotous household and its strange yet sympathetic inhabitants are the ingredients for one of the freshest , funniest comedies in years. -- Robert Lane</DIV></DIV>

And although Wind received only mixed reviews when released in 1992 , it's a technically astonishing film that does for yacht racing what The Black Stallion did for horse racing -- it puts you right into the action with breathtaking camerawork and gripping excitement. Matthew Modine and Jennifer Grey star as experienced sailors determined to win the prestigious America's Cup yacht race. Their love for each other is put to the test when she's removed from the crew and joins up with a maverick designer ( Stellan Skarsgård ) whose new boat design represents the cutting edge of sailing competition. Eventually Modine leaves his millionaire sponsor ( Cliff Robertson ) and reunites with Grey , and their race against the Australian World's Cup champion leads to a thrilling climax on the high sea. Cinematographer John Toll ( who later won back - to - back Oscars for Legends of the Fall and Braveheart ) takes his cameras where no sailing movie had ever gone before , and the results are nothing less than spectacular. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

O'Neill has been handpicked to assist veteran operative Robert Hanssen ( Chris Cooper ) in a new division created to protect all classified FBI intelligence.

But the project seems doomed from the start - not least because his predecessor on the project , Lang's long - term aide , died in an unfortunate accident. The Ghost flies out to work on the project , in the middle of winter , to an oceanfront house on an island off the U.S. Eastern seaboard. But the day after he arrives , a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA - a war crime. The controversy brings reporters and protesters swarming to the island mansion where Lang is staying with his wife , RUTH , and his personal assistant ( and mistress ), AMELIA. As The Ghost works , he begins to uncover clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret linking Lang to the CIA - and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. Was Lang in the service of the American intelligence agency while he was prime minister? And was The Ghost's predecessor murdered because of the appalling truth he uncovered? Resonating with topical themes , this atmospheric and suspenseful political thriller is a story of deceit and betrayal on every level - sexual , political , and literary. In a world in which nothing , and no one , is as it seems , The Ghost quickly discovers that the past can be deadly - and that history is decided by whoever stays alive to write it.</DIV></DIV>

Chief among those is that Grant's first officer ( Tony Curtis , who impersonated Grant that same year in Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot ), a shameless hustler , is better than the navy at delivering whatever supplies the ship and crew need to keep going. But when Curtis sneaks a handful of Philippine refugees and several gorgeous nurses onto the all - male sub , the skipper not only has to cool down his crew but deal with an unexpected feminine influence on ship protocol. The film is a great deal of fun , sprinkled with the director's trademark sight gags ( including one of Edwards's best , involving a torpedo and jeep ), and graced with his unmistakable lilt. Grant is in great form , his comic brilliance almost impossibly effortless. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Directed by Rob Cohen , Dragon traces Bruce Lee's slow rise over myriad obstacles -- most of them race - based -- to become an international superstar in films. Lee's origins are oddly set in San Francisco instead of his real home in Seattle , but then again there is plenty of artistic license going on as Cohen explores the actor's psyche through some powerful fantasy sequences. Lauren Holly is good as Lee's wife , Linda ( whose book about her late husband inspired this movie ) . A scene involving Bruce's rescue of son Brandon ( who died in a filmmaking accident in 1993 ) from a murderous spirit is plain spooky. The special - edition DVD release has a widescreen presentation , director interview , featurette , screen tests , closed captioning , optional French soundtrack , and optional Spanish subtitles. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Julianne Moore plays the cagey cat fancier and computer hacker who possesses a stolen computer disc that makes her a prime target for bad guys , and Robert Rath ( Stallone ) is only too happy to come to her defense.

Dedicated psychiatrist Isaac Barr ( Gere ) reluctantly , and then more obsessively , becomes involved with Heather Evans ( Basinger ), the sister of his patient , Diana Baylor ( Uma Thurman ) . Evans is unhappily married to a gangster ( appropriately played by a muscular and menacing Eric Roberts in a trademark role ) . Gere and Basinger make a credible , if dangerous couple , and Thurman delivers a subtle , understated performance and demonstrates her range and potential. The thriller is appropriately shot in gorgeous San Francisco , where the literal and figurative curving and hilly roads wind throughout. Credit legendary art director Dean Tavoularis for some amazing sets and scenes , notably the elegantly cavernous restaurant where Evans and her husband have a fateful dinner. This film is , in a way , glossy director Phil Joanou's Hitchcockian tribute -- as a climactic lighthouse scene best demonstrates. Final Analysis doesn't offer an intimate look at its characters , but a beautifully stylized one , moody and gloomy. The intricate plot experiments with the device of "pathological intoxication , " in which the subject completely loses control after drinking alcohol. And this doesn't mean a conventional ugly drunk ; it means a frightening psychotic. Good and evil , hope and despair , beauty and repulsion are often juxtaposed in the film's complex world. -- N.F. Mendoza</DIV></DIV>

Myers plays a single guy who always manages to find something seriously wrong with each of his girlfriends. His new love ( Nancy Travis ), a butcher , may be the perfect woman , except for one thing : she might be a "black - widow" killer who prefers dispatching husbands with a sharp instrument. Robbie Fox's original script has a fine shape and strong , black - comedy material within it. But Myers creates unnecessary dissonance by playing a variety of characters ( including an irascible Scotsman like the one he often played on Saturday Night Live ) and accenting his skills as an improvisational comic ( such as impersonating the soothing cadences of a massage therapist ) . It's not that Myers isn't funny doing all that , but it has nothing to do with the movie. Directed by Thomas Schlamme ( Miss Firecracker ) . -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Stirringly narrated by Academy Award winner Martin Landau ( Ed Wood , The Majestic ), SHANGHAI GHETTO recalls the strange - but - true story of thousands of European Jews who were shut out of country after country while trying to escape Nazi persecution in the late 1930s. Left without options or entrance visas , a beacon of hope materialized for them on the other side of the world , and in the unlikeliest of places , Japanese - controlled Shanghai. Fleeing for their lives , these Jewish refugees journeyed to form a settlement in the exotic city , penniless and unprepared for their new life in the Far East. At the turn of the new millennium , filmmakers Dana Janklowicz - Mann and Amire Mann boldly snuck into China with two survivors and a digital camera to shoot at the site of the original Shanghai Ghetto , unchanged since WWII. Their never - before - seen recordings -- along with interviews of survivors and historians , rare letters , stock footage , still photos , and an orignal score by Sujin Nam and Chinese Erhu performer Karen Han ( Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon )-- depicts an incredibly moving portrayal of a rich cultural life , bravely constructed under enormous hardship.

For twelve long years , the Nazis looted and destroyed art on a scale unprecedented in history. But heroic young art historians and curators from America and across Europe fought back , mounting a miraculous campaign that would rescue and return the millions of art works displaced by the war.

Wuornos had a difficult and cruel childhood plagued by abuse and drug use in Michigan. She became a prostitute by the age of thirteen , the same year she became pregnant. She eventually moved to Florida where she began earning a living as a highway prostitute -- servicing the desires of semi - truck drivers. The tale focuses on the nine month period between 1989 and 1990 , during which Wuornos had a lesbian relationship with a woman named Selby. And during that very same time , she also began murdering any of her clientele who attempted to rape her. This turned the tables on a rather common phenomena of female highway prostitutes being the victims of serial killers -- instead Wuornos , herself , carried out the deeds of a cold - blooded killer.</DIV></DIV>

Fourteen years before , he was in a brutal car crash on the island of Lanzarote. In the accident , he not only lost his sight , he also lost Lena , the love of his life. This man uses two names : Harry Caine , a playful pseudonym with which he signs his literary works , stories and scripts , and Mateo Blanco , his real name , with which he lives and signs the film he directs. After the accident , Mateo Blanco reduces himself to his pseudonym , Harry Caine. If he can't direct films he can only survive with the idea that Mateo Blanco died on Lanzarote with his beloved Lena. In the present day , Harry Caine lives thanks to the scripts he writes and to the help he gets from his faithful former production manager , Judit Garc�a , and from Diego , her son , his secretary , typist and guide. Since he decided to live and tell stories , Harry is an active , attractive blind man who has developed all his other senses in order to enjoy life , on a basis of irony and self - induced amnesia. He has erased from his biography any trace of his first identity , Mateo Blanco.One night Diego has an accident and Harry takes care of him ( his mother , Judit , is out of Madrid and they decide not to tell her anything so as not to alarm her ) . During the first nights of his convalescence , Diego asks him about the time when he answered to the name of Mateo Blanco , after a moment of astonishment Harry can't refuse and he tells Diego what happened fourteen years before with the idea of entertaining him , just as a father tells his little child a story so that he'll fall asleep. The story of Mateo , Lena , Judit and Ernesto Martel is a story of "amour fou" , dominated by fatality , jealously , the abuse of power , treachery and a guilt complex. A moving and terrible story , the most expressive image of which is the photo of two lovers embracing , torn into a thousand pieces.</DIV></DIV>

On a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul , Minn. , fans file into the Fitzgerald Theater to see "A Prairie Home Companion , " a staple of radio station WLT , not knowing that WLT has been sold to a Texas conglomerate and that tonight's show will be the last. Shot entirely in the Fitzgerald , except for the opening and closing scenes which take place in a nearby diner , the picture combines Altman's cinematic style and intelligence and love of improvisation and Keillor's songs and storytelling to create a fictional counterpart to the actual "A Prairie Home Companion" radio show , which has heard on public radio stations coast to coast for the past quarter - century ( and which , in real life , continues to broadcast ) .

The film hinges upon the appointment of Robert Leffingwell ( Henry Fonda ) to Secretary of State. Leffingwell has been hand - picked by the President ( Franchot Tone ), meaning that there'll be a battle on the Senate floor between adherents of and opponents to the current administration. Among the participants are veteran Dixiecrat Charles Laughton , freshman Senator Don Murray and powerseeker George Grizzard. Burgess Meredith also shows up as a man who is brought into the Senate to prove that Leffingwell is a communist. To neutralize Murray , Grizzard threatens to dredge up a homosexual incident in Murray's past , which results in the latter's suicide. Advise and Consent is a slow and old - fashioned film , coming to life only when Laughton and Grizzard are on screen -- and in the climax , in which the fate of Leffingwell's appointment is left in the hands of acting President Lew Ayres.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Incorporating film and digital mediums , and black and white and color photography , the film is accompanied by a remarkable score by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood. Pummell selected images that he imagined would remain profoundly resonant even 500 years hence , depicting stages of life that humans experience universally. Arranged according to the cycle of life and development , the images are organized according to birth , growth and play , sexual discovery , nourishment , war , death , and transcendence. This stringing - together of cultural archetypes weaves a kind of updated mythology , reflecting a humanistic belief in the interconnection of all humankind.

Western. Glennon's artistry and Walsh's trademark gusto sustain enthusiasm even as the screenplay beggars belief. The flamboyant Custer ( Errol Flynn ), rushed into Civil War service straight from West Point , did get promoted overnight to general and establish a spectacular record for "ride to the guns" leadership. However , Custer as defender of Indians' rights -- to the point of willing his own Last Stand so he could accuse corrupt Indian Commissioners from the grave -- is historical rewrite of such sweeping chutzpah as to shame DeMille. Flynn and Olivia de Havilland make an even more appealing couple than usual , and the big supporting cast is unflaggingly energetic above and beyond the call of duty. -- Richard T. Jameson</DIV></DIV>

Although the curse of the Black Pearl has been lifted , an even more terrifying threat looms over its captain and scurvy crew : it turns out that Jack owes a blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones , Ruler of the Ocean Depths , who captains the ghostly Flying Dutchman , which no other ship can match in speed and stealth. Unless the ever - crafty Jack figures a cunning way out of this Faustian pact , he will be cursed to an afterlife of eternal servitude and damnation in the service of Jones. This startling development interrupts the wedding plans of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann , who once again find themselves thrust into Jack's misadventures , leading to escalating confrontations with sea monsters , very unfriendly islanders , flamboyant soothsayer Tia Dalma and even the mysterious appearance of Will's long - lost father , Bootstrap Bill. Meanwhile , ruthless pirate hunter Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company sets his sights on retrieving the fabled "Dead Man's Chest." According to legend , whoever possesses the Dead Man's Chest gains control of Davy Jones , and Beckett intends to use this awesome power to destroy every last Pirate of the Caribbean once and for all. For times are changing on the high seas , with businessmen and bureaucrats becoming the true pirates -- and freewheeling , fun - loving buccaneers like Jack and his crew threatened with extinction.</DIV></DIV>

Made in 1970 , this hectic film almost seems ahead of its time when compared to more recent misery - piled - on - misery comedies such as Planes , Trains , and Automobiles. The couple in this film endure everything that can go wrong on a trip , including being forced to spend the night in a mugger - happy Central Park. The strange element in Simon's script , though , is that Lemmon's character is so unpleasant. A middle - class , uptight guy who can't believe that New Yorkers in the service profession don't perform their jobs slavishly , he's kind of a one - note joke that quickly wears thin. Remade with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

But George Khan ( Om Puri ), father of seven unruly moppets and husband to a willful British wife ( Linda Bassett ), is determined to wield his influence over his clan. But what a clan this is , with Nazir ( Ian Aspinall ), who refuses his arranged wife ; Saleem ( Chris Bisson ) who creates -- shall we say controversial? -- works of art ; Tariq ( Jimi Mistry ), the mod boy who lives for discos and English girls ; Meenah ( Archie Panjabi ), the only girl and tomboy extraordinaire ; and Sajid ( Jordan Routledge ), who lives in a dirty fur - trimmed parka. Abdul ( Raji James ) and Maneer ( Emil Marwa ) stay more quietly in the background , although they lend their voices to the chorus of dissent against traditional ways. East Is East is Damien O'Donnell's directorial debut , and he nails the raucous tone from the opening scene , a church parade where the Pakistani children must do some deft maneuvering to avoid being seen by their Muslim father. At times such as these , the film is a straightforward comedy , and the children milk the cultural differences for every laugh they can. Yet the film takes a more somber turn when Saleem balks at his father's insistence on arranging Saleem's marriage. Puri is magnificent straddling the line between lovable father and brute enemy as he demands that the others obey his will , and his performance can be difficult to watch as he metamorphoses. Sympathies toward the characters shift throughout the film , highlighting the superb acting of the entire cast. Ultimately , though , humor wins out , making East Is East a tremendously fun film. -- Jenny Brown</DIV></DIV>

But Alice is not going to play the perfect victim - she isn't about to let her captors use her as capital without a fight. Alice enters into a battle of wills which strains the already fractious relationship between the two men. As the deadline for the exchange draws nearer , all three are brought close to the breaking point , with Vic and Danny's foolproof plan descending into a desperate struggle for survival.

Mary Temple is living her father's dream of running a motel ; only it has become her nightmare. Marly has given her career as an aquatic "Weeki Wachee Mermaid" and her marriage to Steve is over. In the next town over , Desiree Perry has returned to visit and show off her new anesthesiologist husband , Reggie. Sent away by her proud parents after she disgraced them by getting pregnant 16 , Desiree , like Marly , pursued a career in "show business." But instead of Broadway or movies , her appearances have been limited to industrials and infomercials. As both Marly and Desiree grapple with the sometimes - overwhelming weight of family history and family expectations , and wrestle with questions of love , duty and responsibility , the tale offers a portrait of two women , two families , and two communities standing on the brink of change.</DIV></DIV>

This most unusual life story -- written by Steve Tesich ( Breaking Away ) and directed by George Roy Hill ( Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid )-- perfectly captures the tragi - comic , absurdist / humanist worldview of Irving's novel. The opening credits , with a wide - eyed baby floating about the screen to the tune of the Beatles' "When I'm Sixty - Four , " sums up the movie's scope and tone.

The film is set during April of 1984 in post - atomic war London , the capital city of the repressive totalitarian state of Oceania. Winston Smith ( John Hurt ) is a government bureaucrat whose job is rewriting history and erasing people from existence. While his co - worker Parsons ( Gregor Fisher ) seems content to follow the state's laws , Winston starts to write in a secret diary despite the fact the Big Brother is watching everyone at all times by way of monitors. He silently suffers and tries to comprehend his oppression , which forbids individual human behaviors such as free thinking and sex. He meets Julia ( Suzanna Hamilton ), who works for the Ministry of Truth , and they engage in a stoic love affair. They are soon found out , and Winston is interrogated and tortured by his former friend O'Brien ( Richard Burton in his final film appearance ) .~ Andrea LeVasseur , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

This provocative film documents one of the most controversial social movements in American history. When the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade affirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy , a new movement - dedicated to criminalizing abortion - was born. Now , more than 30 years later , with President George W. Bush's conservative appointments to the Supreme Court , Roe v. Wade teeters on the brink of reversal. The film asks and answers the question "in the struggle for dominance over a woman's right to privacy , who wins?"</DIV></DIV>

Some were wounded , some lost their buddies , some lost theirsanity as they tried to quench their intense thirst for revenge by killing the enemy and , consequently , killing civilians. Some buried the enormity of their actions and did notspeak of them --- knowing only that they were following orders their commanders hadrequired to conduct the war.Each man , in his own time , discovers the courage to confront his past actions and beginhis healing. Even though they are still haunted by their time in combat , their ability toface themselves in their waking life and achieve self - reconciliation , is the mark of truevalor. -- © Official Site</DIV></DIV>

The small British town of Grimley has long been dominated by the coal mine where most of the men work , and the town's greatest source of pride is the Grimley Colliery Band , a brass ensemble that's won a number of nationwide competitions. Danny ( Pete Postlewaite ) is a retired miner in poor health who directs the band ; a national championship is coming up , and Danny is determined that Grimley will walk away with a trophy. But many of his musicians have other things on their minds : word has it that the mine may soon close down , and , in a city already suffering an economic downturn , this is just short of a death sentence. Adding to the intrigue is the return of Gloria ( Tara Fitzgerald ), who used to live in Grimley and is back in town for a while on an assignment. While the band has traditionally been all - male , Danny considers bending the rules to allow Gloria in the band , as she's a fine fluglehorn player , but her presence is bad news for the town : she works for the government and is investigating the feasibility of closing down the mine. Ace trumpeter Andy ( Ewan McGregor ) also has mixed feelings about Gloria ; they were once a couple , and he still has feelings for her , but he's not sure he wants to set himself up for another breakup. The real - life Grimethorpe Colliery Band performs on the soundtrack.~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

At the same time. Loudly. He has three teeth , his hair is matted into one huge dreadlock , and he has a notarized document on his wall declaring himself an alien , "so whoever's putting shocks to my head will stop."Thirty years earlier , Roger Kynard "Roky" Erickson was a rock - and - roll icon : A manic white - blues singer who was Janis Joplin's primary influence , he fronted a band called the 13th Floor Elevators , considered by many to be the creators of psychedelic music. After a 1969 marijuana arrest , Erickson entered an insanity plea and was sent to the Rusk State Hospital , a medieval institution deep in the east Texas pineforests. He remained there for three years with the state's most violent mentally ill offenders , then reemerged a changed man : He sang about ghouls , zombies , and Satan , christened himself "the evil one , " and declared himself an alien. At some point he stopped recording altogether and disappeared : "the great lost vocalist of rock and roll."For the past 12 years , Erickson has lived as a total recluse , shut in with his white noise and watching cartoons all day. He collects junk - mail by the stack. He only opens the door for his mother , Evelyn. Evelyn spends her days in their crumbling family home , abandoned by her other four sons and husband , doing yoga and reimagining her life through homemade films and "storyboards" -- large planks of cardboard onto which she's pasted family photos and written out the story of their lives , "to convince myself that I'd been a good mother." Through them , she slowly charts the disintegration of their family.Her youngest son Sumner , the only family member to have escaped , has not returned home in ten years. He hears of his brother's situation and vows to persuade his mother to cede control of Roky in a "crusade to give his brother his life and music back." Upon his arrival , Roky and Evelyn's insular world slowly unravels.</DIV></DIV>

It's easily Carpenter's warmest and most beguiling film , and the only one that ever earned an Oscar nomination. That honor went specifically to Best Actor nominee Jeff Bridges for his performance as an alien visitor to Earth who is knocked off course and must take an interstate road trip to rendezvous with a mothership from his home planet. To complete this journey he assumes the physical form of the dead husband of a Wisconsin widow ( Karen Allen ) who responds first with fear , then sympathy , and finally love. Carpenter's graceful strategy is to switch the focus of this E.T. - like film from science fiction to a gentle road - movie love story , made believable by the memorable performances of Bridges and Allen. It's a bit heavy - handed with tenacious government agents who view the Starman as an alien threat ( don't they always? ), but Carpenter handles the action with intelligent flair , sensitivity , and lighthearted humor. If you're not choked up during the final scene , well , you just might not be human. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

"Desert Bayou" is more than a Hurricane Katrina documentary , it seeks to examine whether two cultures can come together in a time of utter chaos , or whether their differences prove too great a challenge to overcome. In their own words evacuees of Hurricane Katrina , tell how they survived the storm of the century and out of the rubble ended up at a military installation in the deserts of Utah. With interviews from recording artist Master P , celebrity Rabbi Shmuley Boteach , evacuees , political and military leaders , and community and social figures , the questions of race , politics and religion hurdle towards each other in this truly American story : A story of loss and reunion , of sorrow and rebirth , of anger and rejoicing , but most of all... a story of hope.</DIV></DIV>

He is highly respected by the locals. On this day , the Kotovs are visited by the roguishly handsome Dimitri , who was a former lover of Maroussia.

Ione Skye and Fairuza Balk star as sisters Trudi and Shade , who couldn't be more different. Trudi rebels against her mother and her soul - numbing life through sex and develops a reputation among the boys for being easy. Shade is the "good girl" who escapes through the overripe Mexican melodramas in the town's largely vacant theater. Brooke Adams , a loving mother hardened by rejection and a demanding job as a truck - stop waitress , tries to hide her loneliness and disappointment and set Trudi on a better path , but as with so many relationships in this film , conflict brings out the worst in them. Anders , a single mother herself , drew on her own experiences to enrich her adaptation of Richard Peck's novel Don't Look and It Won't Hurt , and she brings a haggard understanding to the strained relations between mother and daughter and the bleak desolation to the lives of three women trapped by circumstance , economics , and landscape , but she also reaches deep into the characters to expose their yearnings and steel their resolve. No knight in shining armor for these women , but Anders allows them to make their way through the emotional landscape with pluck and determination. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

The script by Leigh's mother , Barbara Turner , basically follows her slow descent so deep into a hell of disappointment and smack she almost comes out the other side partially redeemed.

While 'Music From the Inside Out' is about the many people within the ensemble , it is ultimately an intimate musical journey. Each musician's story reveals a struggle to maintain individuality , to test musical boundaries , and to choose the path of an artist. Told without host or narrator , the stories of these musicians are interwoven and build upon each other to ultimately reveal the diversity of personalities that make up a symphony orchestra.</DIV></DIV>

At the beach , Mathieu meets C�dric ( St�phane Rideau ), a handsome teenager with whom he begins a romance after a kiss in the moonlight. Their relationship is threatened by Mathieu's fears of how his family will react and by a violent former lover of C�dric's , but ultimately is brought to an end by something else entirely. Come Undone shifts fluidly back and forth in time and can be confusing , but by the end it's an affecting portrait of both love and melancholy.

Penny ( Michele Hicks ) gets called to a dingy hotel room where she discovers Blake and Francis Falls ( twin brothers Mark and Michael Polish ) . When they go into the bathroom to get her a glass of water , she flees -- but forgets her purse. When she returns , Blake and Francis don't get angry ; they accept her fear and horror with sad resignation. Their vulnerability draws Penny into their lives , as she learns that the illness of one twin threatens the lives of both. Twin Falls Idaho moves slowly , but the pace never drags. The lush cinematography is drenched in color ; the makeup , costumes , and set design feel not quite contemporary and combine to give the movie a dislocated , otherworldly look. The movie was written by the Polish brothers and directed by Michael ; though it's their first film , it feels confident and has a sweet , melancholy humor. The performances of the entire cast -- including supporting appearances by Patrick Bauchau , Lesley Ann Warren , and Garrett Morris -- are consistent and strong. Though clearly influenced by David Lynch ( Blue Velvet , Twin Peaks ), Twin Falls Idaho slowly becomes a unique and affecting creation. The delicate image of the twin brothers quietly whispering in each other's ears will linger in your memory long after the movie ends. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

Written and directed by acclaimed documentarian Lucy Walker ( The Devil's Playground , Blindsight ), the film features an array of important international statesmen , including President Jimmy Carter , Mikhail Gorbachev , Pervez Musharraf and Tony Blair. It makes a compelling case for worldwide nuclear disarmament , an issue more topical than ever with the Obama administration working to revive this goal today. The film was produced by Academy Award ( R ) winner and current nominee Lawrence Bender ( Inglourious Basterds , An Inconvenient Truth ) and developed , financed and executive produced by Participant Media , together with World Security Institute. Participant collaborated with Magnolia on last year's Food , Inc. , recently nominated for an Academy Award ( R ), and the upcoming CASINO JACK and the United States of Money.

Part slavery fable , part mother - daughter tale , part ghost story , Beloved demands an audience's full attention from its dramatic , slightly bewildering opening , when a family dog comes down on the wrong side of some angry , unseen force. But Demme and his talented cast provide an unforgettable payoff for those who surrender. The film traces the life of Sethe ( played in her middle years by Winfrey ), a former slave who has rebuilt what seems to be a peaceful , productive life in Ohio. Yet through chilling , sparing use of flashback , Demme slowly unveils , as does the Toni Morrison masterpiece on which the film is based , the horrors of Sethe's former life , and the terrible event that led to the haunting of Sethe's home. While the horrors of slavery and the bloody event in Sethe's family leave undeniable impressions , the film's brilliance is also evidenced in smaller , equally satisfying ways. Rachel Portman's spiritual - influenced score is as uplifting as it is haunting , and the glimpses of the post - slavery African American world -- as with a simple family outing to a local carnival , or a ladies' sewing - and - gospel circle -- make this a treat for the intellect as well as the heart. The members of the cast , especially Kimberly Elise as Sethe's struggling daughter and Thandie Newton as the mysterious title character , are supremely affecting. -- Anne Hurley</DIV></DIV>

This is not your typical high - school comedy , however , but a reality - based romance set in the housing complexes that ring Paris. The inhabitants are mostly disadvantaged North Africans and the play is an 18th - century comedy whose language is as far from French slang as Shakespeare is from rap.</DIV></DIV>

Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy ( Charles Berling ) is a baron of the 18th century French countryside , wealthy in property and high in social position but poor in cash. Local peasants -- dependent upon his largesse for their income -- are in poor health , the result of a festering marsh that , if drained , could solve the villagers' illnesses and create valuable farmland. Ponceludon travels to Versailles to plead his case before King Louis XVI. There , he is informed that he has no chance of success unless he can impress the court with his verbal prowess , for the king and his minions value banter , preferably of the ironic , cruel , and insulting variety , above all else. Under the tutelage of the Marquis de Bellegarde ( Jean Rochefort ), Ponceludon discovers that his sober , blunt honesty can be mistaken for a skewering wit. Though the baron falls for his mentor's science - minded daughter Mathilde ( Judith Godreche ), he's forced to woo the politically powerful Madame de Blayac ( Fanny Ardant ) . Ridicule ( 1996 ) opened the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.~ Karl Williams , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Years earlier , in 1949 , Joe''s mother Joan Fraser dreamt of nothing but a worker''s revolution ; a communist revolution. She deemed the Australian government''s campaign against communism as a declaration of war. She demonstrated and picketed and preached the virtues of Joseph Stalin. At night she lovingly composed letters to the great Soviet leader , extolling his brilliance and vowing to be , forever , his faithful servant ; Stalin''s Australian voice. Joan''s efforts did not go unnoticed by Stalin. In fact , he invited her to the Kremlin to meet him. But what happens during her visit sparks a fateful turn of events. Joan returns home pregnant ; distraught yet determined to raise her unborn son to be a revolutionary. But as young Joe grows , what becomes his idea of a revolution is not exactly what she had in mind.</DIV></DIV>

There is HERO , the pseudo - documentary about a seven - year - old boy who kills his own father ; HORROR , a sci - fi spoof about a brilliant research scientist who becomes the victim of his own biochemical discovery when he finds the source of the human sex drive ; and HOMO , a noirish drama exploring the obsessive , and sexual , relationship between two male prisoners. As each compelling story is told , their themes become inextricably linked , and the tension intensifies , culminating in an explosive climax of unsettled emotions. POISON is perhaps Todd Haynes most experimental , and most controversial , film.</DIV></DIV>

The film is also a paean to Warhol -- the true king of pop -- and the world which he created around him in the late 1960s. Using the disturbed , but frequently brilliant , visionary - feminist Solanas as her focal point ( Solanas was the founder and sole member of SCUM , the Society for Cutting Up Men ), filmmaker Mary Harron paints a vividly realistic picture of the subculture that surrounded Warhol and his infamous studio , the Factory. Despite her desperate circumstances , there's a feisty vibrancy to Solanas. She's a game , dead - end kid who bristles with the kind of knowing toughness that can turn a pervert's solicitation into an opportunity. And when standard panhandling lines fail her , she offers her services as a scintillating conversationalist -- for pay. Even when she subsequently spirals into a world dominated by paranoid delusions , her intelligence and wit shine through.</DIV></DIV>

Whaley goes to work for a top movie executive ( Kevin Spacey ) who almost immediately begins to wear down his new assistant's exuberance with his whining , egomaniacal tantrums and relentless verbal abuse , even as he promises his young charge a chance to move up the ladder. Culminating in a violent and ultimately ironic confrontation between mentor and prot�g� , this brutal 1994 black comedy benefits from some razor - sharp writing and terrific comic turns from both Whaley ( Hoffa ) as one whose idealism is irrevocably shattered , and Spacey ( Seven , L.A. Confidential ), deliciously funny as a caustic , belligerent , and ultimately sad figure. A savage indictment of both the movie business and the price of ambition , Swimming with Sharks is one of the best black comedies in recent years. -- Robert Lane</DIV></DIV>

On stage , Seinfeld talks about marriage , recalls his time as the country's most eligible bachelor and offers new perspectives on the observations of the every day.

Two luckless life - long friends and suddenly unemployed security guards ( Tim Robbins and John Cusack ) seek to fulfill a lifelong dream try their hand at music - video production. Along the way they encounter the worst the music and television business has to offer , falling victim to a few scams and all the while clinging to their unbeatable optimism. Finally they hit upon an idea to resurrect a long - dead 1960s group , with predictably disastrous results.

The chronicle includes showcase performances by the top Reggae and Dance Hall artists in the business. Historically , Reggae music sprang into life in the '70s. It was the first time that a third world country had made its voice heard on such a large scale. Instantly recognizable , the reggae sound is a celebration of life itself. Now a new generation of reggae artists has emerged and its fathers are still in Jamaica. But along with the Jamaican music , there has often been trouble in the dance. At the dancehalls , respect is threatened , tempers flare and then gunshots. That was the sadly familiar story of Bogle , the now - legendary figure who invented the dance bearing his name. His funeral was a ghetto - spectacular affair , attracting three generations of reggae and dancehall superstars.</DIV></DIV>

Sports physician Marcus ( Kevin Costner , sporting a ludicrously big mustache ) coaxes his flaky brother David ( David Marshall Grant ) into doing something with his life and training for a grueling bike race in the Colorado Rockies. The scenario is complicated , though , by family frictions and the fact that the brothers' dad died of a cerebral aneurysm that has been handed down to one of the brothers. The two train rigorously for the big event ( part of their routine involves outrunning an angry pit bull every day ), then pack the van and head West. Marcus's girlfriend is also the ex - wife of his main rival in the race circuit , providing a bit more intrigue. Veteran action director John Badham ( Saturday Night Fever , War Games ) excels during the bike - race segments , capturing the breathtaking scenery and the demanding nature of the event nicely. The film is somewhat hobbled , though , by the screenplay and character development ; the film plays a bit too much to the sports - movie clich� and the dysfunctional - family story seems like a lengthy prologue to the race. Also , try not to be too bothered by the annoyingly dated soundtrack , and this should be a fairly entertaining , unpretentious little film. -- Jerry Renshaw</DIV></DIV>

When the daughter brings him home from college , he gets his memory back -- and starts coming on to her mom. Sounds like a Jerry Springer show -- "Help!

Their quest is treacherous -- the two men face intense hardship in the African wilderness and must confront native tribes that proceed to capture them and hold Burton hostage while torturing him. Back home in England , the treachery continues as Speke turns against Burton , and their friendship dissolves in acrimony.

Although acknowledged as one of the great noir pictures , it's actually set and shot in London , which gives an exotic , displaced novelty to the usual noir universe. Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian is a jibbering , wheedling , giggling tour de force , as Harry schemes his way to setting up a wrestling match and finally establishing himself as a "somebody." Instead , he manages to irritate the underworld heavies ( memorably , Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan ) whose fingers are already deeply into the criminal pie. Gene Tierney and Googie Withers are the women -- one good , one bad -- who witness Harry's descent. This was director Jules Dassin's final project for a Hollywood studio before the blacklist forced him out , and he packs the film with tortured camera angles and spidery noir shadows ; the movie's a real visual clambake. Night and the City was remade , tiredly , with Robert De Niro in 1992. Bonus : See how strongly this movie has influenced Martin Scorsese. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

Montgomery Clift stars as George Eastman , a handsome and charming but basically aimless young man who goes to work in a factory run by a distant , wealthy relative. Feeling lonely one evening , he has a brief rendezvous with assembly - line worker Alice Tripp ( Shelley Winters ), but he forgets all about her when he falls for dazzling socialite Angela Vickers ( Elizabeth Taylor ) . Alice can't forget about him , though : she is pregnant with his child. Just when George's personal and professional futures seem assured , Alice demands that he marry her or she'll expose him to his society friends. This predicament sets in motion a chain of events that will ultimately include George's arrest and numerous other tragedies , including a vicious cross - examination by a D.A. played by future Perry Mason Raymond Burr. A huge improvement over the 1931 An American Tragedy , directed by Josef von Sternberg , A Place in the Sun softens some of the rough edges of Dreiser's naturalism , most notably in the passages pertaining to George's and Angela's romance. Even those 1951 bobbysoxers who wouldn't have been caught dead poring through the Dreiser original were mesmerized by the loving , near - erotic full facial closeups of Clift and Taylor as they pledge eternal devotion. A Place in the Sun won six Oscars , including Best Director , Best Adapted Screenplay , and Best Cinematography , although it lost Best Picture to An American in Paris.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

"Oswald's Ghost" , offers an unprecedented deconstruction of the mythologies and controversy surrounding what is perhaps the most tangled and far reaching murder mystery of all time. Featuring interviews with Norman Mailer , Gary Hart , Tom Hayden , Mark Lane and others , the film probes the deep psychic wounds inflicted by the Kennedy assassination on American politics and culture , the scars of which remain evident to this day. Using a wealth of archival material , much of it never before seen or heard , "Oswald's Ghost" chronicles America's 40 - year obsession with the single most pivotal event of the boomer generation.</DIV></DIV>

The second in an ambitious trilogy about class struggles planned by Fly , The Inheritance stars Ulrich Thomsen as Christoffer , a successful restaurateur living happily with a beautiful actress , Maria ( Lisa Werlinder ) . Having fled responsibility for helping run his family's steel business -- a miserable time for Christoffer that cost him his health and self - respect -- the happy hero finds himself squeezed by his manipulative mother ( Ghita Norby ) into becoming CEO following his father's suicide. In short order , Christoffer finds himself doing everything he considers despicable : firing loyal employees , jockeying for greater power , forcing out other family members. Fly's somber , low - key storytelling doesn't have to drive home the slow drama of Christoffer's moral and ethical deconstruction. It's a compelling if painful thing to behold , and Thomsen's performance as a man who gets away from himself is something to see. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

One of the most spectacular and renowned conductors of the 30s , Furtwangler's reputation rivaled that of Toscanini's. After the war , he was investigated as part of the Allies' de - Nazification programme. In the bombed - out Berlin of the immediate post - war period , the Allies slowly bring law and order -- and justice -- to bear on an occupied Germany. An American major is given the Furtwangler file , and is told to find everything he can and to prosecute the man ruthlessly. Tough and hard - nosed , Major Steve Arnold sets out to investigate a world of which he knows nothing. Orchestra members vouch for Furtwangler's morality -- he did what he could to protect Jewish players from his orchestra. To the Germans , deeply respectful of their musical heritage , Furtwangler is a demigod ; however , to Major Arnold , he is just a lying , weak - willed Nazi.</DIV></DIV>

With the ill - fated 1972 Watergate break - in and its tragic aftermath -- culminating in the President's 1974 resignation -- as its focus , NIXON examines its subject's complex life , including his difficult youth in Southern California and often troubled relationship with wife Pat. We also see Nixon's incredible political life , during which he held the offices of Congressman at age 33 , Senator at 37 , and Vice - President at 39 , before losing the Presidential election in 1960 and the California gubernatorial race in 1962 , making his startling comeback six years later to win two terms as President. With the inevitability of classical tragedy , Nixon's political career finally crumbles beneath the weight of his past , his ambitions , and his blindness to events just outside his often remarkable range of vision.</DIV></DIV>

Written and directed by filmmaker Tom Laughlin -- and starring him in the title role -- Billy Jack concerns a half - white , half - Indian karate expert who protects a free school built on principles of pacifism by kicking hell out of pesky rednecks. The story actually embraces that tension between Billy Jack's way of doing things and that of the school's founder ( Delores Taylor ), but their tension doesn't so much lead to an examination of principles as it leads to an excuse for Laughlin to incorporate fight scenes between hippie politics. Crude and brutal , the film is pretty exploitative of a viewer's torn sympathies , and in that way Billy Jack actually anticipates much of the simple - minded , violent fare that followed in the movies of the '70s and '80s. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

He argues that unless we act now to change industrial models of agricultural production that rely on petro - chemical fertilizers and insecticides , our children will be condemned to rapidly deteriorating health in the form of cancers , infertility and other illnesses linked to environmental factor. Featuring interviews with children , parents , teachers , health care workers , farmers , elected officials , scientists and researchers , "Food Beware" takes a powerful look at the abuses of the food industry , the challenges and rewards of safe food production , and the practical solutions that everyone can take part in. This remarkable story of one community's crusade to save their children's health is both food for thought and a blueprint for a growing revolution.</DIV></DIV>

If he carries out his mission , Tonho knows that his life will be divided in two : the twenty years he has already lived , and the short time he has left to live. He will then probably be killed by a member of the rival family , as dictated by the code of vengeance of the region. Distressed by prospect of death and urged on by his younger brother Pacu , Tonho begins to question the logic of the tradition of violence.

The relentless efforts of Clinton's enemies grow into an appalling abuse of power , ultimately resulting in his impeachment ( but not his removal from office ) . This documentary , like those of Michael Moore ( Bowling for Columbine , Fahrenheit 9 / 11 ), uses brief clips from Hollywood movies and television to give a boost to the narrative ; this could seem cloying , but The Hunting of the President presents such an impressive barrage of facts and perspectives that it earns some moments of flippancy. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

They hope to sell their particular brand of industrial lubricants to the elusive Mr. Fuller. Spacey and DeVito are seasoned pros , while Facinelli is excited about his first business trip. DeVito is going through some kind of mid - life crisis ; Spacey is all about the sale and little else ; and the new kid is naive , moral , and extremely religious. Once the characters are established , nothing much happens. They talk. They prepare for their sales party , and they talk. The event starts , but the movie quickly cuts to the mess in the room afterward so they can talk about what happened during the party. Even when Facinelli is given an invite to hang out with Mr. Fuller at a private party , the camera stays behind in the hotel room to listen to Spacey and DeVito talk. Talk talk talk. Based on the play by Roger Rueff , who also wrote the screenplay , The Big Kahuna never really feels like a movie , probably because it's all talk and no story , set in a hospitality suite that increasingly feels like a prison. -- Andy Spletzer</DIV></DIV>

A beautiful young Italian detective ( Asia Argento , who does little to convince us she's a tough , seasoned cop ) investigating a serial rapist is suddenly overwhelmed when the paintings in an art museum erupt with life. According to the film , this is "the Stendhal Syndrome , " an intense and overwhelming response to art that turns the viewer mad. As Anna steps in and out of fantasy worlds like Alice through the looking glass , she's kidnapped by her quarry , who repeatedly rapes and tortures her in a dark , dank underground cave. The delirious nightmare of shattered reality becomes a sadistic , mean - spirited spectacle of murder and degradation -- perpetrated on , of all people , the director's own bound and beaten daughter! -- and the thriller disintegrates into a paranoid mystery of amnesia , split psyches , and shadowy phantoms. At its best this is a mesmerizing vision of madness : paintings melt into the real world while objectivity disintegrates before our eyes. But before the unexpectedly sensitive conclusion , Argento puts the viewer through a bravura but brutal series of gory murders ( a slow - motion bullet passes through both cheeks of a helpless victim , and another shooting is viewed from inside the body ) and unsavory violence. The poetic beauty of Phenomenon and the craftsmanship of Suspiria and Deep Red are sorely missed. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

After 200 years , Miles is unwrapped by a group of scientists and awakens to a brave new world of deadening conformity , ruled with an iron fist by a never - seen leader. Miles is forced to flee for his life when the scientists -- actually a group of revolutionary activists -- are overpowered by the leader's police. He eludes the cops by pretending to be an android , and in this guise is sent to work at the home of Luna ( Diane Keaton ), a composer of greeting cards who thinks that the world of the future is perfect as it stands. There's more , but why spoil your fun? Sleeper is the most visual of Woody Allen's earlier films , and demonstrated a more pronounced rapport between Allen and his off - and onscreen leading lady Diane Keaton than had previously existed.

Quasimodo ( voice of Tom Hulce ) is a grotesquely deformed but kind - hearted young man who was abandoned by his parents as an infant and thrown down a well ; he was rescued by the priests of Notre Dame , the massive cathedral in the heart of Paris , and he lives there , earning his keep as a bell ringer. Quasimodo has become the ward of Judge Frollo ( voice of Tony Jay ), an outwardly pious but deeply hateful man who treats Quasimodio with indifference and violently loathes the Gypsies who spend their days in the cathedral's courtyard. Frollo hopes to clear the Gypsies out of Paris with the help of Phoebus ( voice of Kevin Kline ), leader of the troops under Frollo's command. However , Phoebus does not share Frollo's racist views and harbors no ill will against the Gypsies. When Quasimodo is crowned King of the Fools after leaving Notre Dame during the annual festival of Topsy Turvy Day , the hunchback is ordered beaten by the guards as punishment , but Esmerelda ( voice of Demi Moore ), a hot - blooded but compassionate gypsy beauty , shows pity on him and helps free him from his chains. The lovely Esmerelda is the first woman to show kindness to the unfortunate Quasimodo , and the hunchback soon falls in love with her. However , the dashing Phoebus is also infatuated with her , and Esmerelda is attracted to Phoebus as well , though she feels a motherly affection for the hunchback. Judge Frollo finds that he also desires Esmerelda , which only inflames his hatred for the Gypsies when she refuses his proposals. Darker and less outwardly comic than most of Disney's features , The Hunchback of Notre Dame does feature comic relief in the form of Victor ( voice of Charles Kimbrough ) and Hugo ( voice of Jason Alexander ), a pair of gargoyles who befriend Quasimodo , as well as several songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Donald Sutherland is "the Needle , " a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Führer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination , the stiletto. As played by Sutherland , he's a coldly calculating psychopath , emotionlessly focused on the task at hand , whether the task is to signal a U - boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure. On his way back to Germany , a fierce storm strands him on an island , occupied only by a woman ( Kate Nelligan ), her disabled husband , and the lighthouse keeper. A romance of sorts develops between the woman and the spy , due to an estrangement of affections between the woman and her husband , whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well. Much of the suspense of the latter half of the movie has to do with this romance , and the way it begins to reveal the Needle's motivations and whether there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside him , though he remains by - and - large tantalizingly enigmatic. Early on , we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives , and "What else can one do?" the Needle answers , "One can just stop." But as the film makes amply clear in its final third , one doesn't stop , does one? The direction by Richard Marquand ( known primarily for thrillers such as this one and Jagged Edge , although he also did Return of the Jedi ) is crisply done , boasting numerous suspenseful episodes , including a deadly encounter between Sutherland and the disabled husband , which is jaw - droppingly surprising. -- Jim Gay</DIV></DIV>

David Niven plays a wealthy playboy , the father of teenaged libertine - in - the - making Jean Seberg. Seberg tolerates most of her father's mistresses , but doesn't know what to make of the prudish Deborah Kerr , who will not cohabit with Niven until after they're married. Feeling that her own relation with her father will be disrupted by Kerr's presence , Seberg does her malicious best to break up the relationship -- only to be beaten to the punch by Niven , who despite his promises of fidelity to Kerr cannot give up his hedonistic lifestyle. The combination of the daughter's disdain and the father's rakishness drive Kerr to suicide. Niven and Seberg continue pursuing their lavish but empty lifestyle , though both realize that their lack of moral fibre has destroyed a life. The incestuous undertones of the original Sagan novel are only slightly downplayed in the film version ; the tristesse ( sadness ) is visually conveyed by filming the Deborah Kerr flashback scenes in color and the opening and closing of the film in bleak black and white. Bonjour Tristesse was codirected by Otto Preminger , who'd previously discovered Jean Seberg for his benighted 1957 filmization of Saint Joan.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

When he arrives in the Dominican Republic , he's warned against entering the sugar plantations where most of his parishioners live. Breaking a centuries old taboo , he discovers shocking examples of modern - day slavery intrinsic to the global sugar trade. On an island known for tropical beauty , tourists flock to escape winter and relax with little knowledge that just a few miles away thousands of dispossessed Haitians are toiling away in unseen plantations harvesting sugarcane most of which ends up in the United States. Cutting cane by machete , they work 14 hour days , 7 days a week frequently without access to decent housing , electricity , clean water , education , healthcare and adequate nutrition. Often they are stateless , with neither Dominican nor Haitian identity and virtually invisible in the eyes of the law.</DIV></DIV>

Our hostess through this marathon of head games is 28 - year - old Shanté ( Vivica A. Fox -- emphasis on the fox ), who speaks to the camera so much that critic Roger Ebert nicknamed this movie "Waiting to Inhale." In a film packed with positive stereotypes ( no crack - smoking gangstas here , thank you ), she's a successful marketing executive , and her straying boyfriend is a high - profile attorney ( Morris Chestnut ) . Their turbulent romance survives Shanté's 10 - day power play , but not all viewers will be so lucky , since this movie is alternately charming and aggravating , and there's precious little romance while the lovers are plotting their moves. Still , it's a safe bet that many people will appreciate this movie's endearing lesson -- namely , that sincere groveling can save you lots of time and heartache. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Eva has a sweet face but a steely disposition : a few choice words from her and a once - confident man becomes a virtual basket case. Eva has been in charge of her younger sisters ever since their parents died , many years ago. The mere fact that they're married or engaged hasn't deterred her one bit from continuing to take charge of their lives. But the cost of putting family first has been the deferral of her own dreams -- and the assumption of a harder - than - nails personality that no man has been able to crack. Eva's uncanny ability to interfere with her sisters' affairs has not endeared her to their spouses and partners. The men would also like to close out and divide the family trust fund that Eva oversees. So they concoct a simple plan : compensate cash - strapped ladies' man Ray Adams to romance and distract Eva from her financial duties. Sparks fly between Ray and Eva -- but the plan goes awry , leading to surprising consequences and complications</DIV></DIV>

His mouthpiece is Karchy Jonas ( Brad Renfro ), a Hungarian - born immigrant ( like Eszterhas himself ) growing up in Cleveland in 1960. His pop ( Maximilian Schell ) works hard to send Karchy to an expensive high school , where Karchy is ostracized by the rich kids and labors to find acceptance. Into town walks itinerant rock DJ Billy Magic ( Kevin Bacon ), the quintessence of cool with a dark charm. Magic needs a teen to run errands for him ( mostly carrying payola envelopes ), so he hosts a "High School Hall of Fame" contest to help him find an assistant. Karchy , who idolizes Magic , wins the contest by forging signatures of his classmates on postcards. Magic knows of Karchy's deception and is intrigues by it , as that is the kind of dishonesty he's looking for in his assistant. Karchy's lying grows into a major character trait , forcing the kid into many difficult social situations , not the least of which involves government officials investigating the slippery Magic for payola and threatening to jeopardize Karchy's family's citizenship status if he doesn't cooperate. Although no less a formula plot than other Eszterhas stuff , this one's lifted a bit by the director's personal connection to the story and by a great , charismatic performance by Kevin Bacon. Much more could be written about the connection between lying and storytelling , and fending for oneself in the mendacious jungles of Hollywood , but suffice it to say that Karchy eventually grows up to write Showgirls. -- Jim Gay</DIV></DIV>

However , the simple assignment becomes a daring cat - and - mouse game played as the last flames of the Cold War are flickering. This is the first of three films that teamed Jones with director Andrew Davis. In 1989 Jones was a wild card : an actor respected but only popping up in grade B fare. After Davis's Under Siege and The Fugitive , Jones was America's favorite gruff character actor , with an Oscar on his mantel. With a weaker script , Davis still creates the same kind of magic here. Hackman is superb as the officer , an action role similar to others that the nearly 60 - year - old unexpectedly excelled at ( Bat 21 , Narrow Margin ) during this period. Tight , tense , and with no letup in the third act , The Package is a good gem for a Saturday night flick. -- Doug Thomas</DIV></DIV>

His girlfriend Jane ( Kelly Preston , stunning as ever ) says she's leaving , and his boss ( Brian Cox ) says he's selling the business and ace employee Billy may be out of job. Sounds like business as usual for an old - fashioned veteran. However , the business is baseball and for Billy Chapel , the 40 - year old former all - star for the Detroit Tigers , it means his career -- and his life -- is at a crossroads. Although it is no Bull Durham , For Love of the Game finds a solid and very believable role for Costner. The film is based on Michael Shaara's ( The Killer Angels ) stream - of - consciousness novel ( the rough manuscript was found after his death 1988 ) . The entire film takes place on Billy's day on the mound against the Yankees , a meaningless late - season game for the Tigers , but everything for Billy. In flashbacks , he lingers over his long relationship with Jane and his baseball career ( from World Series heroism to a career - threatening injury ) . His one viable link to the game at hand is his catcher , played winningly by John C. Reilly. Costner , like Chapel , is looking for one more great performance , but the film is too simplistic and loopy at times to resonate. The love story has an extra helping of cuteness , and legendary baseball announcer Vin Scully nearly takes on a leading role , waxing grandiloquent. It's no grand slam , but a solid double. -- Doug Thomas</DIV></DIV>

Rarely is one man's struggle for inner peace so poignantly displayed as in this engrossingly sexy and unflinchingly violent love story. Lyric is the young woman who rekindles the dreams of a man tormented by a father's alcoholic violence now perpetuated by an unstable brother. Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett make for one of the screen's most memorable duos in the title roles. Each brings emotional intensity paired with powerful sexuality to their roles. Director Doug McHenry speaks to the 1990s by deftly balancing the story's heightened drama with just enough hope to give it impact. -- Rochelle O'Gorman</DIV></DIV>

Just as no one solved the central mystery in Antonioni's L'Avventura , neither does anyone truly enjoy the literary party that is La Notte's centerpiece. The party is being thrown to celebrate the publication of author Marcello Mastrioanni's new novel. But before he even reaches the door of the house , Mastrioanni's evening is ruined when his wife Jeanne Moreau announces suddenly she is disgusted with him -- this reaction evidently triggered by an earlier visit to a dying friend. Moreau skips out on the party to wander the streets , searching for...for what? Meanwhile , Mastrioanni tries to inaugurate an empty affair with Monica Vitti , the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. The very elements that drive Mastrioanni and Moreau apart at the beginning of the film reunite them at the end. Maybe. L'Avventura and La Notte were the first two chapters in Antonioni's barreness and alienation trilogy ; the third , L'Eclisse , was released two years later.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Nicholson plays a disc jockey whose withdrawn personality translates to radio mystery. But he's out of his depth when he goes home to Atlantic City at the invitation of ne'er - do - well brother Bruce Dern. Dern has a big - money scam that's also high risk , particularly to himself if the black - crime syndicate he's ripping off ever gets wind of it. But Nicholson gets swept up in the blarney of his charismatic older brother , even as he suffers gnawing doubts about the way Big Bro treats his lady friends ( including Ellen Burstyn ) . Low - key but evocative , this is the kind of movie that has you remembering images and moments and feeling for Nicholson's dilemma , long after you've seen it. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

Among those who answered the call were Filipinos in various stages of gender transition. These individuals who see themselves in a female persona , shunned by their families and communities at home , build new lives in Israel as caregivers for elderly , orthodox Jewish men , many of whom come to look upon them as substitute children. On their nights off , the workers perform as a drag queen ensemble , "Paper Dolls , " in Tel Aviv nightclubs. Although the troupe's members enjoy Israel's liberal atmosphere , they are still outsiders and are always treated as such. Tomer Heymann's moving documentary explores the role of immigrant worker in Western culture , and delves into the lives of societal outcasts seeking freedom and acceptance , however tenuous.</DIV></DIV>

After a fully armed SWAT team raided the 65 year old comedian's home in February of 2003 , Chong was sentenced to 9 months in federal prison for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute drug paraphernalia. Of the 55 defendants , Chong was the only one with no prior convictions to receive jail time. Justifying the 9 month sentence , the prosecutor cited the classic 1978 Cheech & Chong film Up In Smoke as evidence that Chong had become wealthy "trivializing law enforcement efforts to combat marijuana trafficking and use."As Roger Ebert said "You do not have to approve of drugs to be offended."The film explores how Chong's legacy as a pro - marijuana comedian made him the target of an over - zealous Justice Department. Operation Pipe Dreams cost tax - payers $12 million. As Chong himself put it "The only weapons of mass destruction the Bush administration has found... are my bongs."</DIV></DIV>

He rides his rickety bicycle across the serenade landscape to and from the mines. He drinks beer in the local pub , fishes off a pier with his workmates Jurgen and Manfred , and watches them nearly come to blows over a chess game. For Schultze , that's really all the spice he needs. When he and his buddies are suddenly laid off at the mine and forced into retirement ten years too early , not even the polka music Schultze has played on the accordion since he was a boy can put the zest back into his life -- but just maybe a little zydeco can! Wandering around his modest home , trying to find contentment in a life of leisure he never asked for , Schultze is channel surfing through radio stations one day when he suddenly catches an unfamiliar rift of music -- lively music that puts a spring in his step that had never been there before. But what of polka? Try as he might , this zaftig salt miner , who has been churning out the same accordion music of generations before him , can't get zydeco out of his system. In an instant , years of music tradition tumbles as easily as the Berlin Wall , and much like that momentous event that brought Germany closer to the Western World , a tie forms between Schultze and America that simply has to be explored.</DIV></DIV>

In a terrifying tale of the "American Dream" gone horribly wrong , four friends find themselves trapped in their hometown in The Crazies , a reinvention of the George Romero classic directed by Breck Eisner from a screenplay by Ray Wright ( Pulse , Case 39 ) and Scott Kosar ( The Amityville Horror , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) . David Dutten ( Timothy Olyphant ) is sheriff of Ogden Marsh , a picture - perfect American town with happy , law - abiding citizens. But one night , one of them comes to a school baseball game with a loaded shotgun , ready to kill. Another man burns down his own house...after locking his wife and young son in a closet inside. Within days , the town has transformed into a sickening asylum ; people who days ago lived quiet , unremarkable lives have now become depraved , blood - thirsty killers , hiding in the darkness with guns and knives. Sheriff Dutten tries to make sense of what's happening as the horrific , nonsensical violence escalates. Something is infecting the citizens of Ogden Marsh...with insanity. Now complete anarchy reigns as one by one the townsfolk succumb to an unknown toxin and turn sadistically violent. In an effort to keep the madness contained , the government uses deadly force to close off all access and won't let anyone in or out - even those uninfected. The few still sane find themselves trapped : Sheriff Dutten ; his pregnant wife , Judy ( Radha Mitchell ); Becca ( Danielle Panabaker ), an assistant at the medical center ; and Russell ( Joe Anderson ), Dutten's deputy and right - hand man. Forced to band together , an ordinary night becomes a horrifying struggle for survival as they do their best to get out of town alive.</DIV></DIV>

Kelvin discovers that his close friend , Gibarian , the mission's commander , has committed suicide. Also , he finds out that the two remaining scientists onboard are exhibiting signs of extreme stress and paranoia , seemingly caused by the results of their examination of the planet Solaris. Soon , Kelvin too becomes entrapped in the unique planet's mysteries. Solaris , somehow , presents him with a second chance at love and entreats him to change the course of a past relationship that has caused him overwhelming guilt and remorse. But can he really revisit the past and alter the course of events? Or is he fated to repeat its mistakes?</DIV></DIV>

Oscar ensnares a proper British man , Nigel ( Hugh Grant ) on an ocean - liner and makes him listen to the twisted tale of his relationship with Mimi ( related in lengthy flashbacks ) and how erotic obsession turned to homicidal hatred. Nigel is married to Fiona ( Kristin Scott - Thomas ), but is captivated by Mimi and listens to Oscar's grotesque stories because of his fascination. Naturally , the whole thing ends in tragedy , but it's wicked fun getting there , as director Roman Polanski paces the film quite well and the cast ( particularly Coyote ) is wonderful.~ Robert Firsching , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Returning to England from the Third Crusades , Ivanhoe is steadfast in his determination to raise the ransom for the captured King Richard ( Norman Wooland ), but the effort is full of peril. First is Ivanhoe's reunion with his estranged father ( Finlay Currie ), a Saxon who hates the Norman king and refuses to give his son the money. Then there's Ivanhoe's unpopular rescue of a wealthy Jew , Isaac ( Felix Aylmer ), from anti - Semites , and the subsequent decision by Isaac's beautiful daughter , Rebecca ( Elizabeth Taylor ), to pay Ivanhoe's entry fee in a tournament. ( The strapped knight seeks the tourney's cash prize. ) Wait , it gets worse : two of Ivanhoe's closest associates ( played by George Sanders and Robert Douglas ) collude with Richard's evil brother , Prince John ( Guy Rolfe ), to discredit their friend and steal away Rebecca and another woman , Rowena ( Joan Fontaine )-- who also fancies Ivanhoe -- for themselves. Yes , the situation looks grim , but surprise appearances by a couple of legendary hero types toward the end help level the playing field. Nonstop adventure to make one swoon , Ivanhoe is a gorgeous treat and reasonably faithful to the Age of Chivalry. Things worked out so well for this film , Thorpe and Taylor got together the next year to make Knights of the Round Table. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage , Beatrix became an iconic figure , swimming quietly , but with great fortitude , against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago , and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and -- had she been a man -- her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition , by the time she died in 1943 , Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust , the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her , remains as it was in Beatrix Potter's day for others to enjoy , is her bequest to the nation.</DIV></DIV>

Drawing on a lifetime of her family's home movies and interviews made over 12 years , filmmaker Cindy Kleine mixes reportage , cinema verite and animation to uncover family secrets and tell a story that could not be shown publicly as long as her father was alive. "Phyllis and Harold" delves into the mystery of time passing , the nature of living a life , and the challenges of losing those we love. But it is also a loving , funny expose on the sins of suburbia. Imagine Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" seen through the prism of "I Love Lucy."</DIV></DIV>

Set in 1918 , the tale is based on an imagined relationship between young Adolf , and an influential Jewish art dealer and teacher , Max Hoffman , who did not encourage the future Nazi leader's artistic abilities. A discouraged artist , who later scorned modern art , Hitler's interests turn elsewhere -- to hatred of Jews , and to Germany's questionable future. The story presents the argument -- could one teacher's failure to encourage a young man to pursue his artistic endeavors be part of the root of the terror that came? Would the Holocaust have been prevented if Adolf Hitler had never stopped painting -- and thus , was able to channel his creative energy?</DIV></DIV>

A team of PAPD first responders drove from mid - town Manhattan to the World Trade Center. Five men , including McLoughlin and Jimeno , went into the buildings and were trapped when the towers collapsed. Miraculously , McLoughlin and Jimeno survived , but were buried and pinned beneath slabs of concrete and twisted metal , 20 feet below the rubble field. Though they couldn't see each other , each could hear that the other had survived , and for the next 12 hours , McLoughlin and Jimeno kept each other alive -- talking about their families , their lives on the force , their hopes , their disappointments.</DIV></DIV>

But can a kid help an old grouch change his ways? Picking up immediately where the 1996 family favorite Shiloh left off , Shiloh2 : Shiloh Season continues the drama of a boy , his dog , and the dog's menacing original owner. Zachary Browne plays the part of Marty Preston , the young boy who rescued an abused beagle by standing up to local troublemaker Judd Travers ( another convincing performance by Scott Wilson ) . Although Marty and Judd struck a deal , Judd seems bent on making the boy and his family pay in more ways than one for keeping Shiloh. Fueled by alcohol , Judd's suspicious character and his tendency to shoot whatever critters he pleases deeply disturb young Marty. Once again , the boy risks his own safety and exercises immense courage and compassion to turn Judd into a friend. Michael Moriarty and Rod Steiger reprise their roles as Marty's father and Doc Wallace , respectively. Because the sequel leans heavily on the original movie's plot , it loses its punch as a stand - alone show. Slightly tougher subject matter ( the effects of alcoholism , in particular ) warrants a slightly older audience ; families with 7 - to 12 - year - olds should fare well. Based on the second book , Shiloh Season , in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's popular children's trilogy. -- Liane Thomas</DIV></DIV>

Director Jim VanBebber ( Deadbeat at Dawn ) delivers an uncompromising snapshot of this cult of personality , hell - bent on executing the brutal vision of its leader , Charles Manson. On a ranch outside of LA the dream of the "Love Generation" is perverting into something evil. What was once an oasis of free love and acid trips has become ground zero for a madman's paranoid visions. An average group of kids , the "Family" , become engulfed in a delusional world where torment and slaughter is considered the path to righteousness. The Manson Family is a dizzying , rapid - fire vision of the sex and violence that unifies the misguided group , and at the direction of their leader , ends in a brutal spree leaving seven people dead in a 48 hours. You've seen the story through the eyes of the law. Now witness it through the eyes of THE MANSON FAMILY.</DIV></DIV>

Through remarkably frank interviews with the man himself and a variety of friends and associates ( including actresses , rival actors , and directors ; porn moguls like Larry Flynt and Al Goldstein ; and , most surprisingly , Jeremy's own family ), Ron Jeremy emerges as a likeable but self - obsessed guy whose insatiable drive for fame and success is also a struggle to overcome loneliness and a lack of self - worth. Not that anyone's going to feel too sorry for a man who gets paid to have sex , but Jeremy's honesty and sense of humor deserve some respect. And despite all the flesh on display , Porn Star is more matter - of - fact than titillating , taking in its subject with a sociological distance. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

A strikingly gifted singer with a range of more than three octaves , Farinelli was given little choice but to sacrifice his manhood in exchange for his art , and as his career was founded on the surgery that would dramatically restrict his off - stage life , his art was in turn hemmed in by his family. Carlo's father declared early on that he should only sing the songs of his brother Riccardo ( Enrico LoVerso ), and while Farinelli's fame gives Riccardo's career a needed boost , the mediocrity of Riccardo's compositions holds Farinelli back. When the singer is given the opportunity to work with the great composer Handel ( Jeroen Krabbe ), his brother's jealously and Farinelli's own poorly chosen career alliances stand in his way. The brothers' often contentious partnership also extends to the bedroom ; while Farinelli's performances set women on fire , he's physically incapable of satisfying them sexually , so he provides the foreplay in a bizarre game of seduction and then turns his conquests over to his brother. Farinelli il Castrato received a Golden Globe award as Best Foreign Language Film of 1994 and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Following the murder of her beloved father -- who leaves his survivors strapped with his debts -- she camouflages her identity as a Protestant of Italian descent and takes a job as governess to an unorthodox Scottish family. In this film by Sandra Goldbacher , sundry conventions from Victorian novels mix with a contemporary , feminist take on Mary's subsequent adventures. Mary asserts , with some effort , her authority over her willful charge ( Florence Hoath ); she dodges the insults of a vaguely ghoulish matriarch ( Harriet Walter ); and she becomes an aide , confidante , and lover to the man of the house ( Tom Wilkinson ), a naturalist dabbling with early experiments in photography. Goldbacher fails to make it all feel as fully realized as it could be ( much of the detail and soul of Mary's life in London is too telescoped and impressionistic to sink in ) . But the film's middle section , in which the heroine's complicity with Wilkinson's married character engages her keen intelligence as well as her untapped sensuality , is deeply felt. It's nice to see Driver prove she can carry a film , though the dreamy , exotic photography by Ashley Rowe certainly pulls a viewer along as well. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Their competitive natures kick into overdrive when the beautiful Ariel ( Ann - Margret ) moves into their otherwise snowbound Minnesota neighborhood. She takes a liking to John , but after a lover's spat she also gives Max a chance at romance , and the long - time buddies reach a peak of grumpy rivalry. It's a stretch to think that Ann - Margret's dating choices would be limited to a pair of grouchy codgers , but sarcastic attitude and snappy dialogue made this a surprise hit ( followed by a 1995 sequel ), and Burgess Meredith adds plenty of spice as Lemmon's amorous old father. Don't forget to watch the hilarious outtakes during the closing credits! -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

However , Bond arrives only to discover that there's a pressing case waiting for him : a large amount of diamonds has been stolen from the South African mines and two offbeat assassins are killing everyone in the smuggling ring , one - by - one. Bond goes undercover as Peter Franks , diamond smuggler , in search of recovering the merchandise. When Bond investigates mysterious activities in the world diamond market , he makes a shocking discovery : that the evil Blofeld is still alive , and has been stockpiling the precious gems to use in his deadly laser satellite capable of destroying massive targets on the planet. Bond , with the help of beautiful smuggler Tiffany Case , sets out to stop the madman , but along the way , he must contend with a host of enemies. He confronts offbeat assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd , two of Blofeld's best assassins. Bond must also navigate his way through the wiles of Bambi and Thumper -- two gorgeous sexpots who are more than a match for Bond in hand - to - hand combat. Finally , there's the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte who Bond suspects may hold a vital clue to Blofeld's elusive whereabouts.</DIV></DIV>

The film begins with a news reel detailing Kane's life for the masses , and then from there , we are shown flashbacks from Kane's life. As the reporters investigate further , the viewers see a display of a fascinating man's rise to fame , and how he eventually fell off the "top of the world." Herman J.

It's not all that different from Air Force One , but the formula story perks right along with considerable suspense as Russell's cohorts ( Oliver Platt , Joe Morton ) try to defuse a chemical bomb that could wipe out ( you guessed it ) the entire Eastern seaboard. John Leguizamo plays one of the U.S. commandos attempting to stop the violent hijackers , and Halle Berry costars as a flight attendant who risks her life to assist Russell's rescue team.

Food is in short supply , and most of the population's food source comes from synthetics manufactured in local factories -- the dinner selections being a choice between Soylent Blue , Soylent Yellow , or Soylent Green. When William Simonson ( Joseph Cotten ), an upper - echelon executive in the Soylent Company , is found murdered , police detective Thorn ( Charlton Heston ) is sent in to investigate the case. Helping him out researching the case is Thorn's old friend Sol Roth ( Edward G. Robinson , in his final film role ) .

Gwen ( Isild Le Besco ) is dismayed that her best friend Lise ( Karen Alyx ) can't join her for their usual joint summer vacation. Fed up with her bickering parents -- in particular her erratic , hard - drinking father -- Gwen seeks solace in the arms of local boys. But what Lise hasn't told Gwen is that she can't come to the coast because her estranged father has just died in a car accident. Though he hasn't been part of her family for many years , his death sends Lise's mother into a nervous breakdown. Lise finally runs away to see Gwen , but they've become so out of synch that the collision of their heightened emotions leads to disaster. Like Life Is Sweet or The Dreamlife of Angels , Girls Can't Swim creates a sad and vivid portrait of an intimate friendship going wrong. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

The cop ( William Baldwin ) is the only man who can save her. It helps that the high - powered attorney is played by Cindy Crawford , who gives new meaning to the phrase "habeas corpus." So the plot doesn't make any sense : First they try to kill her , no questions asked. Then they capture her and spill their guts about all the details of their nefarious plan. But logic is not what Fair Game is about. It's about explosions , car crashes , and more explosions. The only pauses in the action are for showers ( one for Baldwin , two for Crawford ) and a change of clothing ( Crawford slips out of a tight T - shirt into an even tighter tank top ) . The best feature of the DVD is the addition of a Gallic track. With very little actual sex in the movie , having the main characters conversing in French definitely adds some sauciness to the dialogue scenes. -- Richard Natale</DIV></DIV>

In this modest , low - budget feature , they play second and third fiddle ( respectively ) to Perry King , whose respectable career , ironically , would never reach such stratospheric heights. As for their costar and diminutive fourth "Lord of Flatbush , " Paul Mace appeared in only one more movie after this ( Stallone's Paradise Alley ), and was killed in a 1983 traffic accident at the age of 33. Such is the random nature of fame and fate. The movie itself is noteworthy mostly for the pre - stardom appearances of Stallone and Winkler , and a strong costarring role for that most ubiquitous of '70s actresses , Susan Blakely. Despite its amateurish style , muddy sound quality , and rambling scenes that have casual appeal but minimal narrative momentum , the movie is blessed with laid - back authenticity , recognizing the value of awkward pauses and jumpy rhythms of conversation. The ensemble of self - named Lords -- four leather - clad rebels in 1957 Brooklyn , moving reluctantly toward adulthood -- is solidly cast , and even the most familiar scenes ( like making out at a drive - in showing From Here to Eternity ) ring with engaging truth. Codirector Martin Davidson later covered similar territory in Eddie and the Cruisers , and Barry Levinson transcended this shoestring affair with his 1980 classic Diner , but The Lords of Flatbush stands on its own as an earnest and lightly entertaining drama that boosted its costars to bigger and better things. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

But the final product , a slick , glossy drama ( with hip - hop jazz provided by Gangstarr no less ), is just as superficial as the numerous Alger - esque stories of music stardom to which movie audiences are accustomed. Denzel Washington gives a typically charismatic performance as the trumpeter in question , as does Wesley Snipes as his sax - playing rival. And as with most Spike Lee films , there are numerous solid performers in small roles such as Bill Nunn , Latin - music star Rub�n Blades , and comedian Robin Harris. One character , however , attracted unwanted attention : John Turturro's role as an unscrupulous music - industry exec. Critics called the Turturro character , who is at once money hungry , swarthy , and perpetually shrouded in darkness , a classic anti - Semitic caricature. But the charge seems almost irrelevant in Spike Lee's cartoonish , overstylized world of impossibly hunky jazzmen , curvaceous hangers - on , and incessant bebop. -- Ethan Brown</DIV></DIV>

Elder Rogers ( KC Clyde ) has only a couple of months to go on his mission , but his testimony and zeal for missionary work has suffered from hardships he experienced in letters from home. He is now only serving out his time with as little effort as possible when he is given a "greenie" from Oklahoma as a junior companion. Elder Calhoun ( Kirby Heyborne ) has the enthusiasm , innocence and naivet� of a new missionary , and the relationship between the two creates some very funny moments. These two elders share a typical missionary apartment with Elders van Pelt ( Cameron Hopkin ) and Johnson ( David Nibley ) . Elder van Pelt fancies himself a rather handsome ladies man who is keeping an ongoing correspondence with three "girlfriends" back home. He is also very ambitious , and sees himself as quickly moving up the ranks of missionary leadership. Elder Johnson is Elder van Pelt's senior companion , and has a more "seasoned" view of being a missionary. He is looking forward to returning home and marrying his girlfriend , with whom he keeps an active correspondence going. Both elders have certain habits that tend to wear on the other.</DIV></DIV>

Its handsome young stars , playing Jesse and Frank James and gang , crack wise as if they were in a contemporary high school locker room. Combining authentic costumes and sets with stunt work befitting a Jackie Chan comedy , accompanied by an "Old West" soundtrack that's anything but old and only marginally Western , the film yields a few enjoyable highlights. Seasoned genre buffs , however , will cringe at the movie's clash of visual qualities , as well as the dialogue , which , while not as heinous as that in Maverick , is on par with Young Guns in terms of non - period flavor. It's not exactly a testament to the enduring potential of the authentic Western that was realized by Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven , made barely a decade before. With all the light - hearted action and character interplay , it's hard to tell if director Les Mayfield ( Flubber ) is taking the material seriously , but this much is certain : the Jesse James here ( played with effortless appeal by Tigerland newcomer Colin Farrell ) and his brother Frank ( Gabriel Macht ) have almost no connection to historical fact. Nor do their fellow farm - raised gang members , the Younger brothers Cole ( Scott Caan ), Bob ( Will McCormack ), and Jim ( Gregory Smith ) . ( And Jesse's fianc�e , played by Ali Larter , looks like she dropped in from a Gap commercial. ) The gang's post - Civil War battle against a ruthless railroad baron ( Harris Yulin ) and his Pinkerton henchman ( Timothy Dalton ) seems arbitrary , irrational ( since farmers typically welcomed railroads , not fought them ), and riddled with clich�s , turning the movie's bloodless shootouts into another opportunity for pretty - boy preening. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Molly Gunn ( Murphy ) is an heiress living off the estate of her dead rock star father -- until an unscrupulous accountant embezzles everything and Molly has to get a job. After a failed attempt at retail work , Molly finds herself as the nanny for a prematurely humorless and rigid little girl named Ray ( Dakota Fanning , I Am Sam ), whose music mogul mother Roma ( Heather Locklear ) hardly ever sees her. Meanwhile , Molly woos an English musician who's trying to get a record contract from Roma. Unsurprisingly , Ray teaches Molly to take some responsibility for herself , while Molly gives Ray the opportunity to become the child she is -- but despite the formulaic quality of the story , the two actresses play off each other well , and something unexpectedly touching emerges.

Harvey Keitel plays a detective who grills Cynthia for a videotaped confession and the bulk of the movie progresses in a series of flashbacks that accompany Cynthia's testimony. Bruce Willis plays James Urbanski , the violent , drug - addict husband of Cynthia's friend Joyce ( Glenne Headly ) who is murdered one fateful evening at a nearby Feast of San Gennarro festival. Lots of Jersey Italian - style yelling and screaming goes on in the aftermath , with goodfella Frank Vincent in the cast , along with Karen Shallo , Crystal Field , and John Pankow as Cynthia's sullen real estate agent husband. There's also betrayals , threats , and a twist ending. Director Alan Rudolph captures the local New Jersey flavor beautifully and imbues the proceedings with depth via rich photography and use of slow motion and quick cuts. Willis is particulalry good , in a disturbing sort of way , in this , his first collaboration with future ex - wife Moore.</DIV></DIV>

Although director Otto Preminger later claimed little interest in the picture , he couldn't help but bring his even - handed visual style to the widescreen process. The location shooting ( in Alberta ) is eye filling , and that river really does look alarming. Best of all , Marilyn , fresh and vital , had a costar to match her magnetism but not humor her sometimes - scattered approach to acting : Robert Mitchum , as a homesteader with a dark past. He's weighty enough to stand next to MM's bright flame without giving any ground ; they should have worked together again. Since Marilyn plays a saloon singer , she gets to sling some tunes in her inimitable style , with as much glamour as the gold rush - era trappings will allow , giving "I'm Going to File My Claim" various meanings. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

Redford plays Sonny Steele , champion rodeo rider turned corporate spokesman ( and perpetual drunk ) . When he discovers that another corporate asset , a racehorse , is just like him -- dressed like a buffoon and doped up to the gills -- he decides to liberate the animal. Redford's grumpy , wise , and funny performance demonstrates why he was ( and is ) such a big star ( and why director Sydney Pollack made seven movies with him ) . Fonda is fine as the bright , ambitious , frightened TV reporter whose pursuit of a story pitches her headlong into love. The ending may seem anticlimatic ( the big comedy chase comes in the middle of the film ), but this is much more a romance story than a chase film. From the beginning , there's little doubt how the story will end ( although even then , the movie throws us a little curve ), but the movie compensates with sheer star power ; Redford and Fonda are all that matter , and in this case they deliver , along with Willie Nelson's fine performance in a pivotal supporting role. -- Geof Miller</DIV></DIV>

A group of young men from a military academy are stranded on an island. The group quickly becomes fractious with a passive section led by Ralph , trying to get rescued , and a hunter faction , led by Jack , trying to procure meat and "have fun." Peter Brook's 1963 filming seemed to get closer to the Darwinist sense of this cultural disintegration. Here , the hunter faction seems more like Peter Pan's Lost Boys than the bloodthirsty murderers they are. The performances , particularly young Getty , don't quite carry the weight of the situation. It's still , however , sobering to slowly watch the school uniforms traded for war paint , and the little boys turn into little savages. -- Keith Simanton</DIV></DIV>

Richard Dreyfuss stars as a reckless fire - fighting pilot who is killed in what was to have been his final mission. Ascending to Heaven , Dreyfuss is introduced to businesslike angel Audrey Hepburn ( playing the equivalent of the Lionel Barrymore role in A Guy Named Joe ) . Hepburn instructs the spectral Dreyfuss to pass on his aviation knowhow to his young successor , Brad Johnson. Our ghostly hero also smoothes the course of romance for his earthly girl friend Holly Hunter , who after several months' worth of grieving has fallen in love with Johnson. John Goodman injects a dose of comedy relief as Dreyfuss' faithful buddy.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

His wife ( America Ferrera ), his mother ( Melissa Leo ), and his friend ( Jason Ritter ) provide support , but they can't fully understand the pain and suffering he feels since his tour of duty ended. Lonely , James reconnects with an army buddy ( Wilmer Valderrama ), who provides him with compassion and camaraderie during his battle to process his experiences in Iraq. But their reunion also exposes the different ways that war affects people - at least on the surface. This moving , taut story of redemption and reconstruction extends beyond a post - traumatic - stress - disorder narrative. O'Nan is heartbreaking as he explores the depths of his internal struggle ; Ferrera fearlessly tackles her role of a young wife in turmoil. THE DRY LAND is about one man's fight within his own terrain - his country , home , and mind - and his journey to rebuild what he's lost.</DIV></DIV>

The film shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and , at times , disinterested.

But it should be remembered that her first real hits ( Barefoot in the Park , Cat Ballou ) were comedies. This underrated 1977 outing also played for laughs , though it had social - satire underpinnings that still ring true. Fonda and George Segal play an upwardly mobile couple in the time before yuppies -- think of them as protoyuppies. But their status - oriented existence suffers what could be a fatal blow when hubby is maneuvered out of his job. Broke and unemployed , they become armed robbers -- and discover that crime can pay for them to live in the style to which they've become accustomed. Segal and Fonda have a breezy ease as confused suburbanites who bring the same neurotic thoroughness to crime that they do to their careers. But the script ( whose authors include Jerry Belson and Mordechai Richler ) never uses either the Robin Hood angle or any other angle that could sustain a sharp edge ; as a result , the comedy winds up more cute than knowing. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

Accidental meetings result in four people sharing dinner in a bistro , an encounter that becomes a bluntly honest discussion of sex , religion , and sex. Cutaways to other aspects of their lives bring visual variety ( and afford opportunities for cameos by Jack Black and David Cross ), but the meat of the meal is in how four people talk to , at , and against each other. The quartet is sharp and comic : screenwriter Michael Blieden and Matt Price play friends who haven't seen each other in a while , and Annabelle Gurwitch and Stephanie Courtney are the women they bump into. Their patter contains a couple of neat surprises , and ranges over a long menu of relationship issues. It's directed by comedian Bob Odenkirk ( of Mr. Show fame ), and he has two distinct directorial gifts : getting actors into a strong , naturalistic flow , and knowing where the jokes are. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

The chief bad guy , a greedy lobbyist aptly named Dick Dodge ( Lane Smith ), is a perfect , smarmy target , but the movie loses its cool and turns earnest and patriotic , striking a high - minded attitude that it has scarcely earned.

The film moves from Middle America , to the halls of power in Washington , to the global financial epicenter in Manhattan. With both humor and outrage , the film explores the question : What is the price that America pays for its love of capitalism? Families pay the price with their jobs , their homes and their savings. Moore goes into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down ; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington , DC and elsewhere.

The result is an in - depth , painfully raw and humorous exploration of the creative process and the constant conflict of balancing commerce with art , fame with talent and reality - TV with actual reality.</DIV></DIV>

The self - centered Harrer , whose sole pre - occupation was the achievement of fame and glory , would experience an emotional awakening on his fantastic journey that would take him from the heights of conquests to the depths of internment in a British prisoner - of - war camp , then from escape and a harrowing two - year trek through the Himalayas to the mysterious Tibetan city of Lhasa. As a stranger in a strange land where few westerners have ever visited , Harrer was befriended by the young Dalai Lama , and was asked to tutor the religious leader in English , geography and the ways of the Western world. He would eventually spend seven years in Tibet , during a period of tremendous political upheaval in that country , graced with friendship and the spiritual enlightenment of the young Dalai Lama.</DIV></DIV>

Thankfully , this snowy adventure about a boy and his dogs is charming enough to entice the kiddies. Charismatic MacKenzie Astin plays a teenager trying to save the family farm by entering a 522 - mile sled - dog marathon. Except for Astin , the lusciously scenic background has more depth than most of the characters. This is so predictable you could take a nap and miss nothing except a few rousing scenes in the 1917 Winnipeg - to - St. - Paul sled race. Although this is visually more appealing than most family fare , one wishes more attention had been paid to the script. -- Rochelle O'Gorman</DIV></DIV>

This fantasy - comedy was the first pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks , yet it polarizes viewers like a Blue Velvet or Happiness. As the only directorial effort from John Patrick Shanley ( the Oscar - winning writer of Moonstruck ), it is something special , and it's hard to resist the film's feather - light heart tugging. Joe Banks is having the life sucked out of him at a dead - end job. Miserable in his gray surroundings with stark fluorescent lighting , Joe dreams of being brave again. A visit to the doctor reveals that he has a "brain cloud." It's fatal , but he'll be fine for a few more months. An eccentric millionaire , Samuel Harvey Graynamore ( Lloyd Bridges ), hears of Joe's predicament and comes to him with a proposal : The people of the Pacific island of Waponi Woo need a human sacrifice to appease their gods. Why not live like a king for a few weeks , then throw yourself into a volcano? ( Graynamore needs a sacrificial victim to offer in exchange for permission to mine the island for a rare mineral. ) Joe accepts Graynamore's lavish proposal and on his journey meets three romantic possibilities ( all played by Ryan ) . Joe embraces life ; so does the movie. It's packed with smile - inducing supporting performances by Bridges , Ossie Davis , Robert Stack , and Dan Hedaya ; playful songs ( "Sixteen Tons , " "Ol' Man River , " Presley's version of "Blue Moon" ); and amusing scenes ( such as Joe buying luggage ) . Add the daring , imaginative production design of Bo Welch ( Edward Scissorhands ), Hanks and Ryan's chemistry , and Georges Delerue's romantic music and you have a film to fall for. -- Doug Thomas</DIV></DIV>

Peter O'Toole is charming as the well - mannered and honorable Englisman who is haunted by his past mistakes.

Garofalo plays Marcy , aide to dim Massachusetts senator McGlory ( Jay O. Sanders ) . Denis Leary is appropriately slimy as a fellow aide. The senator and Nick dispatch Marcy to the remote ( and fictitious ) Irish town of Ballinagra , where she's supposed to unearth relatives to use in the senator's PR campaign. Along the way , Marcy not only encounters the eccentric locals , but finds herself in the maelstrom of the town's annual matchmaking festival. The single Marcy inadvertently catches the eye of the movie's eponymous matchmaker Dermot ( a captivating Milo O'Shea ) . Dermot senses sparks between Marcy and the equally cynical , recently returned local boy , Sean ( David O'Hara ), once a successful journalist who's returned home to work on a book. The intimacies of the small town , the relationships between the locals , and the dialogue are credible and engaging. Look for beautiful cinematography and music , too. Also notable is the movie's ability to convey the feel of a foreign film while injecting humor that's both sarcastically American and yet Irish in trademark. -- N.F. Mendoza</DIV></DIV>

The film chronicles these cycles by utilizing highly personalized stories that reflect the growing truth about Brazil's huge economic disparities - differences that cause violence on both sides of the spectrum. A frog farm connected to a corrupt politician and one of the most powerful men in Brazil ; a kidnapping victim who had both her ears cut off before she was released to her parents ; a wealthy plastic surgeon who pioneered the procedure used to reconstruct the ears of kidnapping victims ; and a kidnapper who has watched many like him escape the poorest parts of Brazil for the wealthier Sao Paolo , where they terrorize the upper class with kidnappings , theft and murder. MANDA BALA ( SEND A BULLET ) explores the various cottage industries cropping up in response to the violence and links these stories to weave a compelling narrative about what happens in a country where the rich and powerful steal from the poor , and in turn some of the poor terrorize the rich.</DIV></DIV>

At one point he finds himself making his escape manacled to blonde beauty Pamela ( Madeleine Carroll ), whose initial antagonism is smoothed by Hannay's charm and the sheer rush of her thrilling chase. It's classic Hitchcock all the way , a seemingly effortless balance of romance and adventure set against a picturesque landscape populated by eccentrics and social - register smoothies , none of whom is what he or she appears to be. Hitchcock would play similar games of innocents plunged into deadly conspiracies , most delightfully in North by Northwest , but in this breezy 1935 classic , Hitch proves that , as in any quest , the object of the search isn't nearly as satisfying as the journey. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

Scott as a scientist who trains dolphins to speak , only to find them kidnapped for use in a vicious assassination plot. This beautiful production of an exciting adventure was executed by one of the only creative teams that could pull it off : writer Buck Henry and director Mike Nichols ( The Graduate , Catch - 22 ) . Based on the novel by Robert Merle , the film is a nostalgic favorite of the generation who grew up with Flipper. An effective and at times amusing action flick , the film is available for the first time in a special edition DVD featuring an astounding new digital transfer enhanced for 16x9 televisions and a slew of charming supplements.

Taken on those terms it's a lot of fun to watch ( though not for the faint - hearted ), and multiple maniac roles for John Lithgow make it an irresistible shocker that isn't afraid to wallow in its own excess. Lithgow not only plays the evil Dr. Carter Nix , who is performing strange experiments on children , but he also plays the doctor's twin sons , Josh and Cain , who kidnap kids and bring them to their father's laboratory. Lolita Davidovich is a mother whose child has been abducted , but she won't give up without a fight. If this sounds repulsive , rest assured that De Palma focuses on the battle between the mother and the nefarious twins ( this isn't a film about gratuitous child abuse ), and film students will delight in the allusions to Hitchcock , Michael Powell's Peeping Tom , and Orson Welles's Touch of Evil , among others. It never makes much sense or adds up to anything truly satisfying , but thanks to Lithgow's wild performances Raising Cain is the kind of over - the - top thriller that grabs you for 95 minutes and holds you in its entertaining grip. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

In Warsaw at the beginning of WWII , Maria Tura ( Lombard ) and husband Joseph ( Jack Benny ) perform anti - Nazi plays with their theater troupe until they are forced to switch to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Lt. Stanislav Sobinski ( Robert Stack ) falls for Maria and meets up with her during Joseph's famous To Be or Not to Be speech as Hamlet. When Stanislav is eventually dispatched for war , he implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky ( Stanley Ridges ), who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The Polish theater troupe is then forced to use their theatrical skills to ensure their survival. Eventually , they turn to impersonating Nazi officers -- and even Hitler himself -- in order to outwit the enemy and keep the resistance safe from spies. To Be or Not to Be opened to a controversial release in 1942 , when the U.S. was still very much involved in WWII. It was remade in 1983 starring Mel Brooks and real - life wife Anne Bancroft.~ Andrea LeVasseur , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Stocky Rock Hudson stars as the confident , stubborn young ranch baron Bick Benedict , who woos and wins the hand of Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor , a seemingly demure young beauty who proves to be Hudson's match after she settles into the family homestead. For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance , as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink , who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious , grandly realized ( if sometimes slow moving ) epic of the changing socioeconomic ( and physical ) landscape of modern Texas , based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister , put out by the new "woman of the house" ; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor ; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children ; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

The Winslow family arrives home from church in time for a carefully orchestrated meeting between Arthur Winslow , the proud patriarch , and John Watherstone , the young man set to marry Arthur's daughter Catherine , an ardent suffragette. As plans are made for their lives together , Arthur , his wife Grace , Catherine , her eldest brother Dickie , John , and Desmond Curry , the family lawyer and Catherine's admirer , drink Madeira in celebration of the union. Just after the family toasts , Arthur discovers that his youngest son , Ronnie , is back early from the Naval College at Osbourne -- dismissed for stealing a five shilling postal note. Arthur asks his son if he is guilty , explaining "If you tell me a lie , I shall know it , because a lie between you and me can't be hidden." Ronnie swears that he is innocent. Arthur dedicates himself to clearing his son of the charges. After obtaining no satisfaction from the school , he decides to retain the well known attorney , Sir Robert Morton. Since he is a conservative opposed to women's suffrage , Catherine is opposed to hiring Morton. In Sir Robert's chambers Desmond explains their predicament : the legal assumption is that the Admiralty and the Crown can do no wrong and cannot be sued. However , by a matter of grace , such a petition can be granted by the Attorney General , allowing the case to come to court.</DIV></DIV>

O'Toole's suitability for the role is tested by the Broadway treatment of Man of La Mancha , the film version of the hit stage musical. Everybody knows "The Impossible Dream , " that indomitable hymn to , well , quixotic questing , and it is indeed the best of the Spanish - inflected songs. Despite the location shooting in Italy , Love Story director Arthur Hiller can't elude the stagey concept ( in which Cervantes , imprisoned by the Inquisition , acts out the tale of Don Quixote for his fellow prisoners ) . James Coco , as Sancho Panza , is overshadowed by the film's irresistible Dulcinea : Sophia Loren , at her mature peak. ( Her singing , alas , is not as ripe as her beautiful self. ) If you love Cervantes for his earthy ironies , this movie will seem a curious slice of inspirational shtick. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

James Spader and John Cusack play law - school pals whose college idealism quickly falls away once they reach the real world. Playing against type , Spader is the straight arrow who goes on to work for the Justice Department. Cusack is the slippery conniver who parlays a job as an aide to an aging senator ( Richard Widmark ) into a springboard to elective office , all the while cutting corners , compromising his integrity , and breaking rules. For good measure , there's also romantic backstabbing. The film tends to get a shade heavy on the moralizing as Cusack slides further down the slope to outright corruption ; Spader practically carries a sign saying , "I have the moral high ground." Still , both actors give their characters an interesting spin , and it's always good to see Widmark back in action. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

The emperor Mikado and his infant son are the targets of evil spells , and someone amidst the Onmyoji , the longtime supernatural guardians of the kingdom , is suspected of betrayal. A bumbling and somewhat cowardly court official named Minamoto no Hiromaki recruits the famed Japanese folk hero SeiMei , an easygoing yin - yang sorcery master , to help solve the mystery. The two develop a Holmes and Watson relationship while trying to thwart the conspirators. The movie fails to achieve much dramatic tension over a long two hours. With the exception of Mansai Nomura as SeiMei , the acting is exaggerated , as in bad theater. Some shoddy scene and sound editing leads to some clumsy transitions , and the special effects and fight scenes are of the made - for - TV quality. Still , with a lineup that includes Japanese pop idols Kyoko Koizumi and Eriko Imai and villains that cackle with such enthusiasm , Onmyoji nearly qualifies as a campy guilty pleasure. -- Eugene Wei</DIV></DIV>

In 1996 they reunited for this tribute to the good old days and producer - star Williamson brought along a few of his fellow 1970s blaxplo icons : Jim Brown ( Slaughter ), Pam Grier ( Foxy Brown ), Richard Roundtree ( Shaft ), and Ron O'Neal ( Superfly ) . They play old friends and former members of a neighborhood gang in economically depressed Gary , Indiana , who reunite when a new generation of gangbangers using their old street name , the Rebels , turns the city into a war zone. It's great fun to see the old faces back on the screen -- Williamson is still buff and tough , and Brown and Grier have become more charismatic with age -- but they're let down by a slack script and lazy direction despite an almost nonstop barrage of gunfights and back - alley brawls. Even with revved - up 1990s firepower , the film never really captures the explosive energy of the films that made their reputations. You're better off seeing the originals. Paul Winfield and Isabel Sanford also star , and Cohen casts cult faves Charles Napier , Wings Hauser , and Robert Forster in supporting roles. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

It was banned as morally perilous during the German occupation and the original negative was destroyed during WWII. It wasn't until 1956 that Renoir was able to restore the film to its original length. In retrospect , this reaction seems both puzzling and understandable ; at its heart , Rules of the Game is a very moral film about frequently amoral people. A comedy of manners whose wit only occasionally betrays its more serious intentions , it contrasts the romantic entanglements of rich and poor during a weekend at a country estate. Andr� Jurieu ( Roland Toutain ), a French aviation hero , has fallen in love with Christine de la Chesnaye ( Nora Gregor ), who is married to wealthy aristocrat Marquis Robert de la Chesnaye ( Marcel Dalio ) . Robert , however , has a mistress of his own , whom he invites to a weekend hunting party at his country home , along with Andr� and his friend Octave ( played by Jean Renoir himself ) . Meanwhile , the hired help have their own game of musical beds going on : a poacher is hired to work as a servant at the estate and immediately makes plans to seduce the gamekeeper's wife , while the gamekeeper recognizes him only as the man who's been trying to steal his rabbits. Among the upper classes , infidelity is not merely accepted but expected ; codes are breached not by being unfaithful , but by lacking the courtesy to lie about it in public. The weekend ends in a tragedy that suggests that this way of life may soon be coming to an end. Renoir's witty , acidic screenplay makes none of the characters heroes or villains , and his graceful handling of his cast is well served by his visual style. He tells his story with long , uninterrupted takes using deep focus ( cinematographer Jean Bachelet proves a worthy collaborator here ), following the action with a subtle rhythm that never calls attention to itself. The sharply - cut hunting sequence makes clear that Renoir avoided more complex editing schemes by choice , believing that long takes created a more lifelike rhythm and reduced the manipulations of over - editing. Rules of the Game uses WWI as an allegory for WWII , and its representation of a vanishing way of life soon became all too true for Renoir himself , who , within a year of the film's release , was forced to leave Europe for the United States..~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Inspired by the 1958 murders in the cold , stark badlands of South Dakota by Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate , the film's plot , on the surface , is similar to that of other killing - couple films , like Bonnie and Clyde and Gun Crazy. Martin Sheen , in an understated , sophisticated performance , plays the strange James Dean - like social outcast who falls in love with the naïve Sissy Spacek -- and then kills her father when he comes between them. The two flee like animals to the wilderness , until the police arrive and the killing spree begins. What sets the film apart from others of its genre is Malick's complicated approach. Gorgeous , impenetrable images contrast sharply with Spacek's nostalgically artless narration , serving as ironic counterpoints , blurring concrete meaning , and stressing that nothing this horrific is simple. Malick observes , rather than analyzes , the couple in a manner as detached and apathetic as the couple's shocking actions. No judgment or definitive motivations are offered , though Malick's empathy often leans toward his senseless protagonists , rather than the star - struck society that makes killers famous. Compared with the interchangeable uniform cops who hunt them and the film's other nameless characters stuck in suburban banality , the couple are presented like tarnished , warped and frustrated results of squelched individuality. Badlands , on one level , views America's suffocating homogeneity and , conversely , its continued obsession with celebrities ( individuals considered different but adored ) as hypocritical. Ambiguous and bold , the movie hints that society may be as guilty as the killers. -- Dave McCoy</DIV></DIV>

For decades , players , coaches , fans and families came together in Huntington to cheer on Marshall University's "Thundering Herd." For this team and this community , Marshall football was more than just a sport , it was a way of life. But on a fateful night in 1970 , while traveling back to Huntington after a game in North Carolina , 37 members of Marshall's football team , plus coaching staff and team boosters , were killed in a plane crash. As those left behind tried to cope with the loss of their loved ones , they found hope and strength in the leadership of Jack Lengyel , a young coach who was determined to rebuild Marshall's football program and in the process help to heal a community.</DIV></DIV>

Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series , but after the success of Star Wars the project was upgraded into this lavish feature film , which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise ( best known for West Side Story ), the film proved to be a mixed blessing for Trek fans , who heatedly debated its merits ; but it was , of course , a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk ( William Shatner ) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger , an all - powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer ( Stephen Collins ), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia ( played by the late Persis Khambatta ) and his returning veteran crew , Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series , and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes , this is an adventure worthy of big - screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing , and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best ( with its main theme later used for Star Trek : The Next Generation ) . And , fortunately for Star Trek fans , the expanded 143 - minute version ( originally shown for the film's network TV premiere ) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

While the other kids are out having fun , Ben spends these precious few weeks attending bible classes , having driving lessons with his overbearing and overly religious mother and helping out at a local old people's home. It's certainly not his ideal summer but , with a demanding , vigilant mother and a passive vicar for a father , Ben is anything but in control of his own destiny. Ben's absurdly straitlaced world is turned upside down when he gets a job assisting Evie , an eccentric retired actress. Vulgar , dignified and childish all at once , Evie enters Ben's life with a cataclysmic force. Suddenly caught between two worlds , Ben starts to gravitate towards his employer's unconventional and often bizarre ways , even though it continually gets him into trouble with his mother. Evie drafts Ben as her partner in a series of adventures , culminating in a camping trip that turns into a road trip when she cajoles unlicensed Ben into driving her to the Edinburgh Festival. Ben reluctantly ignores his conservative instincts and jumps behind the wheel. What follows is a journey in which Ben and Evie help each other move forward in their radically different lives , as Ben is forced to confront how he was brought up and who he wants to be.</DIV></DIV>

The gorgeous Ms. Connelly is conspicuously put on display in this typically lightweight fluff from writer - producer John Hughes. Frank Whaley does his best to liven up the male - fantasy plot about a semi - nerdy teen who gets a night - watchman job in a variety store , only to find himself locked in overnight with the local knockout ( Connelly ), who's as rich as she is beautiful. She's also really unhappy with her home life and her bully boyfriend ( Dermot Mulroney ), so it's Frank's big opportunity to make his move as a sympathetic Romeo. Shallow and contrived , the movie does have its standard moments of John Hughes delicacy , and a cameo by the late John Candy scores bonus points for comedy. Still , it's clear that the movie exists primarily to satisfy adolescent lust -- and with Connelly as the object of desire , this otherwise tiresome comedy is a triumph of wish - fulfillment casting. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Dumped by her boyfriend ( whom Benjamin Bratt wisely decided not to portray this time around ), a gloomy Gracie goes along with the promo biz until her friend , Miss United States ( Heather Burns ), is kidnapped along with pageant official Stan Fields ( William Shatner ) in Las Vegas. Bullock still has perk to please her fans , but neither she nor her awkward alter - ego has any purpose in a sequel to a movie released five years prior. The result is a desperately unfunny , feature - length commercial for Las Vegas tourism , with outdated homosexual stereotypes ( Diedrich Bader , as Gracie's stylist ) and the usually terrific Regina King ( of Ray and Jerry Maguire fame ) stuck in a glum role as Bullock's butch bodyguard. Armed? Yes. Fabulous? No. -- Steve Wiecking</DIV></DIV>

As parodies of Witness go , For Richer or Poorer can't compete with the Woody Harrelson - Bill Murray flick Kingpin , by the creators of Dumb & Dumber. Allen and Alley are directed by the creator of McHale's Navy. But wait , come back! The true test of talent is a capacity to romp right through weak material , and while this story is hopelessly lame and formulaic , Allen and Alley are credible candidates for the clown prince and princess of broad TV comedy. When somebody wonders how come alleged Amish guy Tim Allen has no beard , Kirstie says , "Lice."

John Malkovich and Debra Winger play Port and Kit Moresby , characters loosely based on Bowles and his wife Jane , who flee New York for North Africa , where they hope to find mystical truths that will reignite the spark of their marriage. But instead they lose their moral bearings ( with help from a friend , played by Campbell Scott , who has an affair with Kit ) while traveling deeper and deeper into the Sahara. Before long , what started as a vacation at exotic lodgings has descended into a tour of hell , as they stumble farther and farther into an unknowable spiritual territory. Though long and at times slow - moving , the film features marvelously nuanced acting by Malkovich and Winger and visionary filmmaking that makes the landscape at once picturesque and threatening. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

The future of the universe rests on one young man , Kamui Shiro , who must destroy either the Dragons of Earth or the Dragons of Heaven - two opposing armies. He alone must decide whether humanity should be destroyed to create a purified universe , or whether it should be protected to preserve civilization. Two oracles , the sisters Hinoto and Kanoe foresee the coming of the Dragons and predict opposite outcomes. Each sister gathers strength and ammunition to insure her own vision for the future. However , neither sister realizes that there is one man who has an even greater power than the Dragons , and that ultimately he will determine the fate of the earth. Which sister will prevail and how does Kamui fit into their struggle? The answer to this question will forever affect humanity.</DIV></DIV>

As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad , Jim's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia , a coach ( "Swifty" ) who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team , teenage sexual angst , and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. Soon , the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals , robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie , an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then , is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity.</DIV></DIV>

As Hubble desperately tries to train a motley crew of dogs from Owen's neighborhood to behave like conquerors before the Greater Dane arrives and decides the planet's fate , the outer space pooch slowly bonds with Owen and discovers why dogs may have joined forces with humans instead of dominating them. Good Boy! will charm dog lovers in particular , but the movie has enough clever touches to engage most viewers , and it manages a sweet tone without turning cloyingly saccharine.

In Billy Wilder's classic , Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis teamed up in a male - as - female drag comedy , whereas here , writer - star Nia Vardalos goes a step further ( and several derivative steps backwards ), teaming up with Toni Collette as the titular heroines , playing women posing as men posing as women -- kind of like Victor / Victoria with excess mascara. They witness a murder , and the killer knows it , so they hightail it out to West Hollywood , where ( with the help of poodle wigs and garish cosmetics ) they blend in with the performing drag queens at the Handlebar club , where queer makeovers are fabulously mandatory. Connie ( that's Vardalos , to Collette's ditzy Carla ) gets the hots for a drag queen's straight brother ( David Duchovny ), and even Debbie Reynolds pitches in to give a show that any gay crowd would love. There are some well - earned laughs along the way , but the whole thing feels like a sitcom we've seen before , which pretty much summarizes Vardalos's career to date. Vardalos has genuine comedic talent ( and so does Collette ), but it's adrift in this hash of old ideas. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

When the swashbuckler is injured , he turns his sword over to the swishbuckler , who is just as good a swordsman , though a few shades less fiery. Some of the gay humor is heavy - handed , but Hamilton easily handles the comedy demands of the dual roles , and has strong support from Ron Leibman as the chief bad guy. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

Sally Field is the Miami reporter who is set up to leak information on a dead - end murder investigation. A sneaky government official ( a marvelous , rubber - band - spinning Bob Balaban ) provides the information that implies liquor distributor Paul Newman is under investigation. When the story runs , it uncorks a legal quagmire that puts the spotlight on presumably innocent lives. As the lawyers explain , the paper's story is accurate , even though it may be untrue. The details of the story are sharply drawn by first - time screenwriter and former reporter Kurt Luedtke ( who later went on to win an Oscar scripting Pollack's Out of Africa ); the film could be used in a Media Ethics 101 class. Newman secretly counterattacks in a clever plot to derail the process that quickly encompasses his jittery friend ( Oscar nominee Melinda Dillon ) . Field's continuing ethical gaps -- including falling in love with her subject -- stretch the film's credibility. Then again , who wouldn't fall for Paul Newman in the Florida sun? -- Doug Thomas</DIV></DIV>

Still , beggars can't be choosers and he accepts -- only to discover that the part involves impersonating the dictator of Parador , a troubled Central American country on the verge of revolution. The dictator has died , but his chief adviser ( Raul Julia ) doesn't want that news to come out ; he'd rather continue the charade that the big guy is still in charge. And to his surprise , the actor discovers that he enjoys the acting challenge , until he figures out that Julia is positioning himself to take over as the country's true strongman. Naturally , Dreyfuss also discovers that , aside from enjoying the perks of power ( including the late dictator's toothsome mistress , Sonia Braga ), he actually has the power to do some good -- to Julia's chagrin. Dreyfuss captures the actor's insecurity , while Julia is hilarious as the wild - eyed adviser to whom torture is second nature. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

Graced by handsome production design -- most notably a glass and latticework interstellar craft that looks like a battleship crossed with a modern skyscraper -- The Black Hole is in many ways the most beautiful science fiction film of its era. Unfortunately , the graceful and gorgeous picture is jarred by dialogue that wouldn't pass muster in a comic book and a silly conclusion that plays like a murky , dime - store knockoff of 2001. Too bad , because the visual realization of the film is a veritable haunted house of futuristic phenomena , from the cloaked zombie - like drones shuffling through corridors to the devilish , crimson robot Maximillian , the strong arm of the mad scientist played by Maximilian Schell ( a kind of wild man Captain Nemo with an even more ruthless temperament ) . Only the way - too - cute robot V.I.N.CENT ( voiced by Roddy McDowall ), a merchandising gimmick that looks like a Fisher - Price toy , mars the technological landscape. Robert Forster is the quietly authoritative captain of an exploration ship that stumbles across the seemingly derelict ship , and Anthony Perkins , Yvette Mimieux , Ernest Borgnine , and Joseph Bottoms fill out his crew. This is one case of a triumph of art direction and special effects over story -- it's worth sitting through it to see the magnificent scene of the fireball rolling through the ship's enormous hull alone. The rest is just atmospheric gravy. -- Sean Axmaker</DIV></DIV>

He sits next to her , creating a disparate scene of two classes in soft harmony , until she sneers at his advances and rushes into the arms of her preppy boyfriend. Offended , he grabs her and forcefully kisses her. Sun - hwa demands an apology , and when Ha - Gi refuses , he is beaten by a group of soldiers who had witnessed the assault. As a final insult , Sun - hwa spits in his face while he is restrained. Soon after , Sun - hwa makes the mistake of taking a seemingly forgotten wallet filled with cash. She is apprehended by the owner , and forced to pay a huge sum or be turned into the police. With no money , she signs a contract that results in her being sold into prostitution to repay the debt. Whisked away to the neon colors of a Seoul brothel , her introduction to street life is harsh and cold , her teacher an iron - hearted woman with only disdain for the untrained Sun - hwa. As she is brought into her drab room for her first encounter , we learn who is really behind her imprisonment. Watching from behind a double mirror in her room , sits Hang - gi , the 'Bad Guy.' As Sun - hwa descends further and further into street life , she takes on the full - fledged traits of a john - luring prostitute. Hang - gi's curtain parts to reveal Sun - hwa's harsh education through the mirror , and his tears expose his growing feelings for her. Hang - gi's language is reduced to facial gestures , his throat marked with the long lash of a scar straight across from ear to ear. After a failed escape attempt , Sun - hwa is taken to the seashore by Han - gi. Here she is confronted with a series of mysterious torn photographs that seem to suggest a hidden past or even a possible pre - determined future between Han - gi and herself.</DIV></DIV>

This is the jaundiced vision of director Adam Rifkin , best known for the raucously enjoyable Detroit Rock City and the cult curiosity The Dark Backward. He's corralled some good people for this low - budget offering ( Natasha Lyonne and Ann Magnuson as hookers , Vinnie Jones as a cruel pimp ), but the lion's share of screen time goes to a pair of small - time crooks ( Donnie Montemarano and Vinny Argiro ) planning to split for Vegas in the morning. It's diverting for a while , but the bleached - sepia look and unrelenting rancidity take their toll , grinding the picture down. Even a soft - shoe shuffle for Fayard Nicholas ( of the awesome Nicholas Brothers ), a grace note if there ever was one , can't lift the movie out of its determined sense of gloom. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

Then a thief breaks into Bishop's studio and steals one of his paintings , which -- after the thief concocts a dramatic and sorrowful life for the reclusive artist -- sells for $10 , 000. The lure of easy money helps the thief convince Bishop to manufacture a hoax and turn this fictional artist into an art star. Before long , Bishop finds monstrous success that he can't take any credit for , and a girlfriend who dumped him when he was a failure decides to blackmail him for a share of the loot.

Very simply , they are struggling to find out who they are. Lolita Cassard is a young woman of 20 years who has it in for the entire world because she doesn't look like the girls in glossy magazines or like her young mother - in - law.

Etienne Cassard is a man who doesn't see other people much at all because he's busy looking at himself. He struggled long and hard to find his place in the world , and now he's feeling older and wanting for love. Pierre Miller has lost faith and doubts he'll ever meet with success. Sylvia Miller believes in her husband , at least in his talent , but has doubts about her own abilities and that of her pupil , Lolita -- until she realizes she's the daughter of Etienne Cassard , the author she admires so much.</DIV></DIV>

Such has been the fate of Shane "Footsteps" Falco , once a hot All American prospect on the football field. Shane can only regret what's behind him , and can't even begin to imagine what's ahead. But Fate is not through with Shane. When League players decide to strike , leaving the prospect of empty fields ( and equally empty stadiums ) for team owners to contemplate , the Washington Sentinels scramble for a solution. When they bring contentious and self - retired head coach Jimmy McGinty back into the fold , McGinty seeks out players who will play with their hearts rather than their wallets. For the League , the situation is a disaster , but for Shane and a mismatched crew of outsiders , it's a second chance to grab at sports stardom. As they amaze everyone with their winning streak , the ragtag group discovers in itself the ability to hope for more than they ever thought possible , maybe even the playoffs , which has been denied to the Sentinels for seven years.</DIV></DIV>

The pilot ( James Stewart ) and the navigator ( Richard Attenborough ) do their best to maintain order among the survivors , a group of oil men not well - suited for survival in the desert wastes. Some of those who appear to be the most resourceful reveal themselves to be inept or cowardly , while other less prepossessing types -- notably bespectacled Standish ( Dan Duryea ) -- demonstrate surprising inner reserves of strength. The ultimate fate of the survivors rests in the hands of Heinrich Dorfmann ( Hardy Kruger ), who uses the wreckage of the old plane to design a new one. The Flight of the Phoenix was dedicated to the memory of veteran stunt pilot Paul Mantz , who was killed while filming the take - off scene of the new plane.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Founded in 1909 in response to the notorious Aryan Paragraph , which forbade Austrian sports clubs from accepting Jewish athletes , Hakoah rapidly grew into one of Europe's biggest athletic clubs , with its members achieving astonishing success in many diverse sports. In the 1930s Hakoah's best - known triumphs came from its women swimmers , who dominated national competitions in Austria. After the Anschluss in 1938 , the Nazis shut down the club , but the swimmers all managed to flee the country before the war broke out. Sixty - five years later , members of the swimming team reunite in their old swimming pool in Vienna , a journey that evokes memories of youth and femininity and strengthens lifelong bonds. Told by the swimmers , now in their 80s , the chronicle is about a group of young girls with a passion to be the best. It is the saga of seven outstanding athletes who still swim daily as they age with grace. Above all , it is a celebration of life.</DIV></DIV>

One of the balseros ( rafters ) was on a raft that was not seaworthy and had to return to Havana. The others made it far enough to be picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard and taken to the North American naval base at Guantanamo , where the film crew caught up with them , and recorded their many months of confinement. Their families in Cuba had no news of them. When the balseros were finally allowed to go to the United States , the film crew went with them to a string of cities that included Miami ; the Bronx ; York , Pennsylvania ; Grand Isle , Nebraska ; Albuquerque , New Mexico ; and a host of other places to which the lives of these immigrants carried them. Seven years later , the film crew visits them again , to discover what their destiny has been in the United States.

That alone is reason to check it out , and many pleasures await those who are receptive to director Roy Andersson's conspicuously offbeat worldview , presented here as a series of marginally connected vignettes illustrating a bleak world that has literally ground to a halt. A perpetual traffic jam lurches through an urban landscape imbued with post - apocalyptic atmosphere , a ghost town populated by pale , shell - shocked citizens bereft of hope and teetering on the edge of collective madness. Characters and plot are nonexistent in any conventional sense ; it's as if Andersson has cast himself as a detached God , gazing upon these lost souls from a distant remove , as if they were fish in a tank , lumbering through their oppressive city like zombies at the dead - end of civilization. Described by critic J. Hoberman as "slapstick Ingmar Bergman , " this highly unusual film is certainly not for everyone , but if you're on its wavelength it's sure to prove unforgettably amusing. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

If the math is slightly off , the now - legendary ad campaign for The Broadway Melody can be excused. After all , sound had just come in , and a full - scale musical film was still a novelty. This tuneful 1929 production became a smash hit and won the Best Picture Academy Award ( R ) in the second Oscar ( R ) ceremony. The story is a creaky tale of two sisters bringing their act to Broadway , but the fun is in the Roaring Twenties lingo and the showbiz melodrama. This is an era when a gal could become the toast of Broadway by standing , motionless , on a stage pedestal ( "Those guys aren't gonna pay 10 bucks to look at your face -- this is Broadway!" ) . The tunes include the standard "You Were Meant for Me" ; most of the dramatic weight is handled by the peppy silent star Bessie Love , who was Oscar - nominated. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

It's an incriminating look at major college recruiting in the days of secret payoffs , circa the early 1990s. Coach Pete Bell ( Nick Nolte ) seems to be the only honest man left in sports , and the pressure to win at his UCLA - like school soon takes its toll. For action fans , the well - staged games are only at the bookends of the movie : the film is about scandalous recruiting and the passion of the coach. Shaquille O'Neal's ballyhooed debut is short and sweet as a nearly mythical basketball warrior. The biggest acting surprise is Boston Celtic legend Bob Cousy's deft debut as the school's AD. The film is a little too preachy at times , but the sermon is worth listening to , especially with some solid laughs from Shelton's stinging pen. Director William Friedkin's change - of - pace film would only be half the movie without Nolte , who is instantly believable as the workaholic coach. In game situations where opposing coaches are the likes of Bobby Knight ( one of many excellent cameos ), Nolte comes off as the real thing. -- Doug Thomas</DIV></DIV>

Marlene Dietrich plays the German - born Catherine , who is required to marry Russia's mad Grand Duke Peter ( Sam Jaffe , decked out in a Harpo Marx wig ) . As if her joke of a marriage isn't torment enough , Catherine must endure the excesses of her new mother - in - law , Empress Elizabeth ( Louise Dresser ) . Eventually , Catherine finds solace -- and romance -- in the form of Count Alexei ( John Lodge ) . But even this balm is denied her when the ambitious Alexei begins wooing the much - older Elizabeth. When the old Empress dies , Catherine ascends to the Russian throne , knowing full well that her addled husband would kill her at the slightest provocation. Soon her power outstrips Peter's , and the opportunistic Alexei now comes back into her life. The finale finds Catherine emerging triumphant over all her enemies -- and , in the film's least subtle sequence ( which is saying a lot! ), the new Empress is shown astride a horse , to whom she displays far more affection than any of her human compatriots. The Scarlet Empress has even less to do with accuracy than Paul Czinner's Catherine the Great of the same year , which starred Elizabeth Bergner. Watch for Dietrich's real - life daughter Maria Sieber ( aka Maria Riva ) as the 7 - year - old Catherine in the early scenes.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

What appears to be a search for a missing person is actually an examination of alienation and self - discovery found along a voyage through the morally decadent world of the idle rich. Less concerned with a smooth plotline , Antonioni tells his story through the use of symbolic images and flawless character development. Using 'real time' camera shots and rich , landscape imagery , Michelangelo Antonioni creates an unpredictable world where nothing is ever resolved. Ironically , what makes L'Avventura so unpredictable is the high level of realism portrayed by each character and their environments. This isn't your packaged , formulaic film with a happy ending. A tough one to watch but well worth it...and it gets better and better with repeat viewings. L'Avventura is quintessential Antonioini. Not to be missed. -- Rob Bracco</DIV></DIV>

Living peacefully in the rural Iowa home of an old , friendly motel owner ( Jean Stapleton ), the winged Michael ( Travolta ) is hardly the image of a perfect angel. He's scruffy , unshaven , eats sweetened cereal by the box - full and chain - smokes all day long. But when tabloid reporters ( William Hurt , Robert Pastorelli ) learn of Michael's alleged existence and head to Iowa to check him out , Michael soon realizes that it's his task to see that Hurt falls in love with an "angel expert" ( Andie MacDowell ) and breaks free from his habitually cynical attitude. There's more to the story , of course ( and Chasing Amy fans will recognize Joey Lauren Adams as a waitress who charms the angel ), but Michael is more about the effect that this enchanting angel has on the earthbound humans around him. Whether he's chipping away at Hurt's skepticism or attracting a crowd of women on a truck - stop dance floor , Michael is an enchanting figure , and Travolta plays him with just the right tone of humor , reverence , and effervescent charm. Sure , it's lightweight fluff , but director Nora Ephron specializes in lightweight fluff , and Michael is the kind of feel - good movie that never wears out its welcome. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

They dispose of the body and vow to keep the incident a secret , but a year later somebody starts sending them letters bearing the warning "I Know What You Did Last Summer." At that point the panicked foursome becomes the target of an elusive serial killer whose disguise consists of a fisherman's slicker and a lethal ice hook. Part mystery and part slasher flick , this thriller was heavily hyped as a follow - up to Scream by screenwriter Kevin Williamson ( who later created the TV series Dawson's Creek ), and like Scream it's a showcase for a teenage cast including Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar. And while this shocker isn't as inspired as Scream , it's guaranteed to give its target audience a few good thrills as it dives toward a routine climax of mayhem and murder. Based ( rather loosely ) on the popular novel by Lois Duncan. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

There's a kind of demented genius to the idea of casting NBA superstar Michael Jordan in a live - action and animated movie costarring the beloved characters from Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes cartoons. They play off each other like seasoned veterans of vaudeville , and Jordan never falls into the kind of awkward , amateurish showmanship that you might expect from a sports idol. He's comfortable in the cartoon land of his costars , who include Bugs Bunny and sexy newcomer Lola Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig , Elmer Fudd , Sylvester & Tweety , Speedy Gonzalez , the Tazmanian Devil , Foghorn Leghorn , and Yosemite Sam. They've all been hijacked to an outer - space amusement park run by the Nerdlucks , who strike a Faustian bargain with the Looney heroes : if Bugs and Co. can defeat the Nerdluck "Monstars" in a basketball game , they'll win back their freedom ; if they lose , they'll be doomed to stay there forever as enslaved entertainers. So they kidnap Jordan as their coach and "secret weapon" while the nefarious Nerdlucks suck out the basketball skills from such stellar victims as Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing. It all leads to reckless abandon on the basketball court , and Bill Murray pops in for some hilarious support. Combining traditional animation and computer - generated Nerdlucks with its live - action cast , Space Jam was made in the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes cartoons , where anything goes as long as it's funny and off - the - wall ( or the ceiling , or the door , or the floor... ) . Technically astounding , it's also witty enough to entertain adults and kids alike. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

The narrative depends on a lot of coincidences and some implausible behavior -- but the story is secondary. Levity focuses on the characters , which are brought to life by the excellent cast ( including Kirsten Dunst as a self - destructive club - goer ) . The movie lays out its themes of redemption and atonement a bit heavily , but it creates some very human moments along the way. -- Bret Fetzer</DIV></DIV>

Now Perry tells his own story in the 2000 autobiographical drama Bootmen. Anyone who saw the summer 2001 blockbuster Pearl Harbor will find a familiar plot : A reckless hotshot tests the patience of his mentor , but his undeniable talent lands him a rare work opportunity. He leaves behind his friends and his girl , and when he returns unexpectedly , he finds that his girl has taken up with his best friend. In this case , the hotshot is hoofer Sean ( Adam Garcia , who cofounded the original Tap Dogs troupe and played the lead in the stage version of Saturday Night Fever ), and the best friend is his brother , Mitchell ( Sam Worthington ), who had a one - night stand with his girl ( Sophie Lee ) . Along the way , Sean decides to create his own dance troupe and put on a benefit show , which allows for elements of The Full Monty and Brassed Off ( depressed industrial town needs a lift ) and October Sky and Billy Elliot ( father doesn't approve ) . OK , so the plot isn't any great shakes , but the dancing is terrific -- flashy , hard - edged , and gritty , using steelworks machinery as props. If you're a fan of Tap Dogs , you'll enjoy this backstage look at the troupe , but if you're here just for the dancing , you might prefer to start with the original full - length show. -- David Horiuchi</DIV></DIV>

Among the regulars is Francis ( Bruce Greenwood ), a troubled taxman haunted by Christina , a young stripper played by Mia Kirshner. As the film hypnotically unfolds , their relationship is slowly explored , the narrative dovetailing with the stories of a gay pet shop owner ( Don McKellar ), the Exotica's pregnant owner ( Arsinee Khanjian ), and its embittered DJ ( Elias Koteas ) . Like all of Egoyan's films , Exotica is a riddle , its answers only fostering more questions. The director's recurring themes of family breakdowns , voyeurism and obsession are all in the mix here as well , but essayed with a new clarity of vision and intensity.~ Jason Ankeny , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Perhaps taking this message a bit too seriously , Pete decides it's his goal for the summer to help someone get into heaven ; having been told that Catholicism is the only sure path to the kingdom of the Lord , Pete decides to convert a Jew to Catholicism in order to improve their standing in the afterlife. Hoping to find a likely candidate , Pete begins visiting a nearby synagogue , where he gets to know Rabbi Jacobson , who responds to Pete's barrage of questions with good humor.

Joining them in the epic is Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh , a dashing seafarer and newfound temptation for Elizabeth. Elizabeth : The Golden Age finds Queen Elizabeth I ( Oscar ( R )- winner Cate Blanchett ) facing bloodlust for her throne and familial betrayal. Growing keenly aware of the changing religious and political tides of late 16th century Europe , Elizabeth finds her rule openly challenged by the Spanish King Philip II ( Jordi Molla )- with his powerful army and sea - dominating armada - determined to restore England to Catholicism. Preparing to go to war to defend her empire , Elizabeth struggles to balance ancient royal duties with an unexpected vulnerability in her love for Raleigh. But he remains forbidden for a queen who has sworn body and soul to her country. Unable and unwilling to pursue her love , Elizabeth encourages her favorite lady - in - waiting , Bess ( Abbie Cornish ), to befriend Raleigh to keep him near. But this strategy forces Elizabeth to observe their growing intimacy. As she charts her course abroad , her trusted advisor , Sir Francis Walsingham ( Academy Award ( R ) winner Geoffrey Rush ), continues his masterful puppetry of Elizabeth's court at home - and her campaign to solidify absolute power. Through an intricate spy network , Walsingham uncovers an assassination plot that could topple the throne. But as he unmasks traitors that may include Elizabeth's own cousin Mary Stuart ( Samantha Morton ), he unknowingly sets England up for destruction. The Elizabeth : The Golden Age trailer tells the thrilling tale of an era...the story of one woman's crusade to control love , crush enemies and secure her position as a beloved icon of the western world.</DIV></DIV>

Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 , causing the levees that had previously kept the city from flooding to burst , which led to death , destruction , and homelessness on an alarming scale. Lee carefully plots the buildup to the hurricane , using many of the key figures in the city -- such as mayor Ray Nagin and local radio show hosts -- to outline the warnings given to residents. The film then covers the hurricane itself , showing gut - wrenching pictures of dead bodies and people pleading to be saved , before it settles into a lengthy discourse on the government response to the tragedy. Celebrities such as CNN's Soledad O'Brien , Sean Penn , and Harry Belafonte all appear , but Lee mainly focuses on the words of those who somehow made it through Katrina and lived to tell the tale. The majority of those people are highly critical of the Bush administration for its poor response , attributing this to the fact that the bulk of the residents affected were African - American. A powerful and important piece of filmmaking , WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is an eye - opening account of a catastrophe that could so easily have been avoided.</DIV></DIV>

The story finds a posse of black shooters ( with one white member , played by Stephen Baldwin ) taking on a racist sheriff and military man , but Van Peebles's effort at mixing convention with hip credentials gets pretty grating. ( Tone Loc makes the worst cowboy in film history. ) The film is also incredibly sexist , going well beyond the usual frontier - floozy clichés and lapsing into the sort of blatant exploitation one found at that time in rap - music videos. There are lots of cameo appearances from familiar folks willing to support Van Peebles on a project that probably sounded like a mix of experiment and event -- Pam Grier , Isaac Hayes , Woody Strode , and the director's father , Melvin Van Peebles.

Now a powerful mob boss , Yanis has longed for his cousin's release for years , firmly believing that together they can rule the crime - strewn streets of their Parisian suburb. Though Dris tries to resist , he plunges headlong back into the criminal underworld when his brother is kidnapped during a botched attempt at an armed robbery. Dris plants himself in the center of negotiations to rescue his hapless sibling , and finds himself once again ensconced in the world from which he was so desperate to escape.Director Manuel Boursinhac revisits some classic themes from 1950s French mobster films for this feature , fully updating them with modern - day street slang and violent scenes of confrontation. Offering a poignant snapshot of Arab immigrant life in the poverty - stricken suburbs of France , LA MENTALE is a powerful thriller that delivers a strong message about the lure of criminal activity for minority groups in the outskirts of Paris.</DIV></DIV>

Thirteen years later that very same boxer , Arturo Ortega ( Jimmy Smits ), has three sons whom he's training to be boxers too. His schoolteacher wife wants to make sure they get good grades , but Arturo is sure that boxing is their best chance to get out of the barrio. Flash - forward another 10 years , and the training is paying off. The three boys , Jimmy ( Clifton Collins Jr. ), Sonny ( Jon Seda ), and especially Johnny ( Ernesto Hern�ndez ) have grown into smart and talented boxers. Obviously , Arturo is a good and a tough trainer , but the question of whether he's got his own or his sons' best interests at heart arises when a slick promoter ( Ron Perlman ) offers him big money first for his sons' contracts and then for a series of title fights. Price of Glory does an admirable job of riding that conundrum throughout , offering no easy answers. There is solid acting throughout and it's nice to see such a Latino - heavy cast , but at just over two hours the pace lags and the central themes are repeated one or two too many times. Aside from a late subplot about corruption and violence that comes across as a bit contrived , this is a good family film about boxing. -- Andy Spletzer</DIV></DIV>

Friedman and pioneering goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis followed up a year later with Two Thousand Maniacs!. The drive - in movie would never be the same. Filmed in 14 days in St. Cloud , Florida , on a luxurious budget of $62 , 000 , this instant cult classic revels in the grisly fate of three unwitting Yankee couples who've been falsely detoured to the Southern hick town of Pleasant Valley ( population 2000 -- get it? ) . These unlucky lovers are the guests of honor at a Confederate centennial celebration. What they don't know is that the twisted citizens of Pleasant Valley are vengeful ghosts of the Civil War , determined to dispatch their "guests" in deviously unpleasant ways. Simply put , Two Thousand Maniacs! ( with Blood Feast ) is the original "splatter" film. On the murder menu : death by amputation , dismemberment by horses ( one per limb ), crushing by boulder , and , the most unsettling ( or creative? ), death by barrel rolling... with flesh - ripping nails in the sides. Tame by later standards yet still absurdly shocking , Two Thousand Maniacs! is the pure , funny - freaky essence of exploitation cinema , complete with the obligatory Playboy Playmate ( Connie Mason ) in the cast. Lewis ( a former literature professor , no less ) frequently cited this as his proudest achievement , and who's going to argue? With its crude direction , atrocious acting , and delirious redneck flavor , the movie genuinely deserves its place in cinema history , its dubious entertainment value proving surprisingly durable through the decades. A milestone of movie bloodletting , it was followed , appropriately enough , by Color Me Blood Red in 1965. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

The fact - based story focuses on the quiz show Twenty - One and popular contestant Charles Van Doren ( Ralph Fiennes ), a charming , well - bred intellectual who agreed to win the game by using answers supplied by the show's producers. This unfair advantage turned Van Doren into a prototypical media darling at the expense of reigning Twenty - One champion Herbie Stempel ( John Turturro , in a bravura performance ), a working - class Jewish contestant who , according to the show's sponsors , had worn out his welcome in the public eye. When a congressional investigator ( Rob Morrow ) catches on to the scam and Stempel blows the whistle on this backstage manipulation , Quiz Show becomes a smart , political expos� about the first generation of television , the corrupting effect of celebrity and success , and the ongoing loss of innocence in American society. Bristling with superior dialogue and energized by an excellent cast including Paul Scofield as Van Doren's morally upstanding father , Quiz Show succeeds as history lesson , intelligent thriller , and morality tale , setting the stage for the countless scandals that would follow in a nation addicted to television. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Room 100 , the Chelsea Hotel - a faded 19th century fa�ade masking , a clientele of junkies. The floor of the tiny en - suite bathroom is covered in blood. And , slumped between the toilet and the sink is the body of a woman , peroxide blonde in black bra and panties. She is Nancy Spungen , a twenty year old , heroin addicted , former stripper , prostitute and groupie. She also has the accolade of being Sid Vicious' girlfriend , to add to her crimes! A trail of blood leads to the bedroom where an NYPD detective - watched by his partner and six uniform officers - is slapping the aforementioned Sid , until minutes ago out cold on a concoction of drugs that might have killed a horse , across the face. He comes round. And seeing he's got an audience , gives way to bravado : "Go on , arrest me. I'm a dog , a dirty dog. I did it and I deserve everything I get , shoot me , kill me!" Sid was arrested and charged with the murder but the case never came to trial and many questions remained unanswered. His guilt unproven and his innocence proclaimed. Alan G Parker sets out on his journey to discover the truth. Nancy is a regular on the punk scene with a talent for giving great blow jobs and a taste for musicians and heroin. Legend has it that she slept with every member of one major band , in one night! The men use her then lose her. The women brand her "Nauseating Nancy". But Nancy's determined , ballsy. She knows what she wants and she'll do anything to make sure she gets it. When the Heartbreakers leave for London on tour , Nancy follows and washes up at SEX , the King's Road clothes shop run by McLaren and his girlfriend , Vivienne Westwood looking for Jerry Nolan , the drummer in the Heartbreakers Sid's debut is at the Notre Dame Hall , just off Leicester Square. Dressed in trainers , jeans with the knees ripped out and a Vive Le Rock T - shirt and a brand new Fender Precision bass , he looks every inch the star. He hogs the mic. He steals the limelight. Watching , in the audience is a bottle blonde in black jeans , a black leather jacket , studded belt and a string mohair jumper bought from SEX : Nancy. She is accompanied by Linda Ashby , a junkie prostitute and already a Sex Pistols insider. Nancy and Sid wake up in bed together. It's morning , 11am - and this girl hasn't left yet. Sid thinks she must be his girlfriend. And from that day on , she is. Friends remember the birth of the co - dependent relationship of this modern day Romeo and Juliet that could only end one way : badly. It's 1977 - Jubilee year , the Pistols at their height sacked by A&M Records and picked up by Virgin in a matter of weeks , they achieve the worlds first banned number 1 single - and the inseparable Sid and Nancy are joined at the hip , living on a diet of sex , punk and heroin. There are fights. Sid downs a bottle of vodka , turns to the heroin and tries to throw himself out of a third floor hotel window. Nancy saves him by grabbing his belt. She's thanked when he takes out his frustrations on the hotel furnishings and her. A few short months and a disastrous US tour later , the band is finished. The victims of too much to soon , and their own now growing egos. Sid returns home to Nancy and heroin. They hole themselves up in a love - nest in Pindock Mews. Steve Dior , the only surviving member of Sid's solo group , remembers going round for dinner - "I didn't know you could ruin fish fingers and beans , but she managed it". Domestic bliss it is not. When 'Dead on Arrival' director Lech Kowalski turns up to the flat to film Sid and Nancy , all he gets is footage of them lounging in bed , Sid in sunglasses and barely conscious , clutching a scotch and coke and Nancy lighting his cigarettes and finishing his sentences. They look like corpses in waiting. McLaren is trying to keep the idea of the Sex Pistols alive with Sid as front man. With Nancy in tow , they go to Paris. Sid records his iconic version of 'My Way'. But he's a physical wreck and almost impossible to work with. Nancy has other plans anyway. She usurps McLaren as Sid's manager. Sid and Nancy put together a show with the help of Glen Matlock , the man Sid replaced in the Sex Pistols. His fellow Rich Kid' Steve New and Rat Scabies. The Vicious White Kids play an amazing one - off gig. Sid and Nancy pocket the proceeds and head to America. Sid and Nancy unpack in room 100 of New York's Chelsea Hotel - Sid's gold records , a Never Mind the Bollocks poster and an innocuous - looking Fairy Liquid bottle. In it is the couple's stash of Methadone and Nancy's scrapbook , filled with cuttings on the legend that is and can only be - their own. Sid's gigs are getting him a reputation. He's out of it , cutting himself , getting bloody. Backstage , Nancy takes her revenge on the US crowd that had shut her out before she went to England , jealously controlling contact with Sid , not letting those who'd shunned her anywhere near her very own rock star. For the first time in her life , she's in charge. 12th October , 1978. Room 100 , the Chelsea Hotel. The Never Mind the Bollocks poster unpacked that summer is littered with needles. Sid's gold discs are spattered with blood. And Sid is being led away by the NYPD. He's taken from the hotel to be arraigned at a New York courthouse. As the New York Post of 13th October 1978 had it : 'Sid Vicious , bass guitarist of Britain's spitting and stomping Sex Pistols Punk Rock band , yesterday was arrested and charged with stabbing his sultry blond girlfriend to death in their room at Manhattan's famed Chelsea Hotel. His face pale and scratched , the dazed - looking Vicious muttered curses and "I'll smash your cameras" as he was led from the hotel.' In court , Sid rests his head on a table and shudders throughout the 10 - minute hearing. He is taken to the tough Rikers Island prison , photographed for ID , and locked in a cell to await his trial. And begin detoxification. What happened in the hours that preceded his arrest? Did Sid really kill Nancy? And , if he didn't , who did? The official story goes like this. Sid and Nancy spent the night doing drugs with friends. When they were alone , they fought. Sid took one of his knives and stabbed Nancy in the abdomen then passed out as she bled to death. When the police arrived , Sid confessed. Alan Parker's first witness is Steve Dior , Sid's former band mate. Sid might have "confessed" when he was slapped conscious by the NYPD but from that day to the day he died , Sid swore he hadn't killed Nancy. Dior remembers Sid's insistence when he asked him point blank if he'd done it : "I didn't do it! I didn't kill her! I didn't kill Nancy!" It's a view shared by other friends of Sid. If they knew one thing about Sid Vicious , it was that he loved Nancy Spungen. But their drug - fuelled life together had been violent. So he loved her , but did that prove he didn't kill her? An autopsy on Nancy's body confirmed that she had died from a single stab wound to the abdomen. She'd been stabbed some time between 6am and 7am and died some time between 9am and 10am. The doctors' reports of the time said she would have survived between two and three hours after being stabbed. But the police team investigating Nancy's murder had overlooked some important evidence : a bottle of Tuinol tablets and some brown flaky powder and three hypodermic needles. They were discovered hours later. Expert opinion insists that the dose of Tuinol that Sid took would have knocked him out cold. Doctors at the time estimated he'd been unconscious for five hours or more. Sid came round sometime around 9.30am when he found the body and raised the alarm. According to the experts , he must have been unconscious since , at the latest , 4.30am. If Nancy was stabbed between 6am and 7am , then Sid couldn't have done it. One of the witnesses to the circumstances around Nancy's demise was Neon Leon Webster , a singer / songwriter and drug addict who was in room 119 with his girlfriend when Sid and Nancy were said to have visited them at 9.45pm the night before Nancy turned up dead. The version of events Neon Leon gave to the police not only does not stack up but is different to the version of events he gave to the New York Post twelve hours later , which is different again to the version he told the Soho Weekly News a few days after the murder! So with the police case founded on unreliable testimony and experts prepared to say Sid couldn't physically have done it , who did kill Nancy - and why? To take Deep Throat's advice to Watergate investigators Woodward and Bernstein - follow the money. Sid and Nancy , not the sort to have bank accounts , had just been paid $20 , 000 in cash by Virgin Records for the royalties due to Sid for 'My Way'. They hadn't made much of a dent in it yet , so on the night of Nancy's murder , most of the cash was sitting in the bedside cabinet in their hotel room. Friends and witnesses who were there in the hours before Nancy's body was found remember seeing it. By morning , it was gone. So whoever did kill Nancy had quite a motive... Alan Parker's investigations over the past 22 years have led him to the door of a number of suspects and plenty of evidence that it is likely that Sid did not kill Nancy. Stanley Bard , the Chelsea Hotel manager , bears them out too. And James Merberg , the lawyer hired by McLaren and Virgin Records , to defend Sid believes that if he had made it to trial , Sid would have been acquitted. So that was that. Only Sid is in Rikers Island prison and the police and press think they've got their man. Case closed. McLaren posts the $25 , 000 bail. Sid is released into the care of his mother , Anne , and books into The Deauville , a low - rent welfare hostel on Madison Avenue. Sid's upbeat , telling McLaren and his mother how his fellow inmates at Rikers loved the Sex Pistols. He was "Big Charlie Potatoes" in there. McLaren plans a change of image - clean living , keep fit. But Anne has trouble selling it to her punk legend son. A month later , Sid gives his last UK television interview to Bernard Clarke on BBC's Nationwide. "Where would you like to be?" Clarke asks Sid. "Under the ground." "Are you serious?" "Oh yeah." Sid is hanging out with friends - among them Peter Kodick , Steve Dior and Eileen Polk. There's a new girl too - Michelle Robinson , Sid's going to clubs , drinking and popping pills. One night in a Manhattan disco called Hurrah's , he gets into a row with a man called Todd Smith , who takes exception to Sid trying to chat up his girlfriend. There's a fight. There's the sound of smashing glass. Peter grabs Sid and makes a human chain behind him. They get out before the police arrive. But Sid finds himself straight back in Rikers. There , he composes poetry about Nancy and mails them to her mother. Those letters from prison changed Deborah Spungen's opinion of Sid Vicious. Elsewhere the tide was turning too. Merberg was building a strong defence. McLaren was on his way back to America , ready to look out for Sid on his expected release on bail , with an album deal under one arm. But events took over. Sid's released from prison before McLaren can get there - and handed like a parcel to his mother , Anne. They arrive at 63 Bank Street : Michelle's flat. Eileen Polk is there. Howie Pyro and Jerry Only , friends of Sid's show up. They sit on the bed and listen to Sid's tales from Rikers. Then Jerry Nolan and his girlfriend arrive. Sid and Jerry start pestering Anne for money for drugs. Dinner is cooking. Sid plays air guitar to the New York Dolls. They eat. But then Peter Kodick and a friend turn up just before midnight. People start wandering around the flat looking for spoons. It's not long before the guests are once again around Sid's bed but this time he's overdosing. They walk him round the flat , fret about whether to call an ambulance. They don't. With Sid just about ok , the guests leave Anne , Sid and Michelle in the flat with a warning to keep Sid away from the rest of the heroin. By morning , Sid Vicious is face down and naked on his bed. At 21 years old. He is dead. NYPD records show that the heroin seized on the streets on New York that winter was cut down to between 32% and 36% pure. But Peter Kodick remembers that the wrap he'd bought for Sid that night was nearly 100% pure. The Rolling Stones were in town and Keith Richards didn't entertain anything that wasn't pure or practically uncut. Sergeant Richard Houseman , the first officer on the scene , recalls seeing two women in the flat. The younger - Michelle Robinson - was hysterical , the older - Anne Beverley - eerily calm. On February 7th 1979 , Simon John Beverley that became John Simon Ritchie that was Sid Vicious was cremated after a low - key service in New Jersey. That same day , Anne Beverley , pulls up at the guarded gates of St David's cemetery in Philadelphia carrying her son's ashes. She can't get past the walls and the security. It starts to snow as she walks back to the car. But Anne hasn't left. She is driven to the back of the cemetery , climbs the wall and scatters the ashes on Nancy's grave. It is at this graveside in St David's Jewish Cemetery on the outskirts of Philadelphia , where Nancy Spungen - her hair dyed back to its natural chestnut brown , in her green high - school prom dress - was laid to rest aged 20 by her mother and where the 21 - year - old Sid Vicious' ashes were scattered by his own mother. And it is here where Alan Parker's story comes to an end. Before she took a fatal pills overdose in 1996 , Anne Beverley wrote to Alan Parker. In her letter , she asked him to prove that her son was innocent. 30 years later Who Killed Nancy pulls together all of the evidence on the story of Sid and Nancy. -- © Official Site</DIV></DIV>

Jimenez , who personally lives with the same condition , gives us an insider's point - of - view on the first terrible days , weeks , and months of adjusting to paralysis , and its effect upon relationships , work , and sex. But the film is also about other kinds of unexpected turns in a life , in this case Stoltz's immersion in an instant community of fellow paraplegics , as well as his reevaluation of an affair with a married editor ( Helen Hunt ) . Stoltz is in great company : besides Hunt's thoughtful , sensual presence , the cast includes Wesley Snipes as another patient , Elizabeth Pe�a as a sympathetic nurse , and William Forsythe ( Palookaville , Raising Arizona ) in an outstanding performance that encourages one to reconsider his often one - dimensional career. Despite the bleak subject , The Waterdance is an enormously entertaining and often funny movie that keeps a lid on pity and explores the rediscovery of life , self - respect , and honesty following a disaster. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Co - written by Allen and Mickey Rose , this side - splitting takeoff of crime documentaries stars Allen as Virgil Starkwell , a sweetly inept career criminal. The film's most celebrated sequence involves Virgil's inability to write coherent holdup notes ( I have a gub ), but others include Virgil's losing battle with a recalcitrant coke machine and his misguided effort to emulate John Dillinger by carving a gun out of a bar of soap ( his weapon disintegrates in a heavy rain ) . As was often the case in Allen's early films , not all the gags work , but for the most part , Take the Money and Run is a delight , enhanced by the on - target supporting performances of Janet Margolin , Marcel Hillaire , and ( uncredited ) Louise Lasser , as well as the energetic musical score of Marvin Hamlisch.~ Hal Erickson , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

But amidst a swirling media frenzy and overly effusive civic pride , things start to go awry ; the team has lost the signal and must scramble to find the astronauts before NASA discovers their grievous error.. And you thought Sydney 2000 was the first time we showed the world!</DIV></DIV>

Golbahari , a 12 - year - old Afghan girl and her mother lose their jobs when this new regime closes the hospital where they work. As the Taliban has already begun to take over Afghanistan , the country's women find themselves forbidden to leave their houses without a 'legal companion' -- specifically , a boy or a man. With both her husband and brother dead , there is no one left to support the family -- and without being able to leave the house , this mother is left with nowhere to turn. Feeling that she has no other choice , the mother -- along with the grandmother -- disguises her daughter , Golbahari , as a boy. Now called Osama , the girl embarks on a terrifying and confusing journey as she tries to keep the Taliban from finding out her true identity.</DIV></DIV>

Howard. It was a troubled production and the outcome is far different from the more serious and intelligent epic that screenwriter Charles Pogue had originally conceived. Still , this is a giddy , energetic throwback to the Ray Harryhausen movie fantasies of the 1950s and '60s , and it's a perfect vehicle for Kevin Sorbo , the hunky star of TV's Hercules : The Legendary Journeys. Sorbo brings an appropriate combination of depth and physical agility to the role of Kull ( son of Conan ), but he and director John Nicolella know better than to take this stuff too seriously. The movie's humor is nicely integrated into the dialogue without resorting to lame punch lines , and Tia Carrere is enjoyably campy as the evil goddess who lures Kull from his favorite concubine ( Karina Lombard ) as she plots to overthrow the kingdom of Valusia. Playwright Harvey Fierstein also provides comic relief in a scene - stealing role , and with an abundance of black magic , stunning Slovakian locations , and grand battles of good versus evil , this heroic adventure is more entertaining than you might expect. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Stuff happens : a cop who likes her gets jealous and beats up the Muscles from Brussels ( but only after handcuffing him ), there's a fire in the barn , bad guys are trying to drive her away , etc. The story was first developed by screenwriter Joe Eszterhas ( Basic Instinct ) and the late director Richard Marquand ( Eye of the Needle ) .

Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie , a self - absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out - of - control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing , but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality ; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand - ins are Jason Biggs , Michelle Williams , and Jonathan Rhys - Meyers , all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self - destructive behavior. Jessica Lange , professional as always , is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title , or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth , perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay between Prozac Nation's shooting ( in 2001 ) and its emergence on cable - TV and DVD is all too easy to understand. -- Robert Horton</DIV></DIV>

In his directorial debut , Chazz Palminteri lends a delicate hand to allow his talent - laden cast creative latitude to portray a handful of odd bedfellows who share little in common but loneliness on Christmas Eve. Susan Sarandon is remarkable as Rose Harrison , a divorced book editor who spends the holidays at a nursing home with her mother deep in the clutches of Alzheimer's. Although Rose's own story bleeds pathos , she shows genuine compassion toward others - whether it's the abandoned , mysterious patient across the hall , or the desperate fianc�e , Nina ( Pen�lope Cruz ) who broke her engagement to her beloved Mike ( Paul Walker ) because of his suffocating jealousy. In separate subplots soon to collide , a strange bartender ( Alan Arkin ) divulges how his past was forever altered by someone he thinks is Mike , while another Alzheimer's visitor , Charlie Boyd ( Robin Williams , uncredited ) helps Rose accept the possibility of miracles in an uplifting climatic twist. Though some of the storylines inch toward the improbable , the film manages to veer just to the right of maudlin. Instead , it arrives as a heartwarming , life - affirming tale that tugs at the heartstrings ( with a haunting musical score by the famed Alan Menken ) . Grab some 'nog and a hanky. ( Rated PG for sensuality , language , and some intense thematic material ) -- Lynn Gibson</DIV></DIV>

Bligh pushes his men beyond physical endurance , slashes their rations for his own profit , and drastically cuts down their frolicking time with scantily clad Tahitians. Finally , the moment everyone has been waiting for arrives : first mate Fletcher Christian ( Clark Gable ) hits his limit and all hell breaks loose. Gable holds doggedly onto his American accent through the entire movie , but in a way it makes Christian come off as a Regular Guy in opposition to Bligh's institutionalized cruelty. Once you get past the hurdle of his diphthongs , Gable makes an excellent Fletcher Christian -- strong , fair , and noble , and he effectively conveys the struggle of a man who loathes the idea of mutiny but can't stand see his men mistreated. And Charles Laughton is just superb. His Bligh is thoroughly appalling , yes , but it's far from a one - note performance -- when he is cast adrift on the open sea in a lifeboat and tries to make an impossible journey to land , you can't help but root for him. Mutiny on the Bounty won the 1935 Academy Award for Best Picture and picked up a Leading Actor nomination for each of its male leads. Check it out or be tied to the mizzenmast. -- Ali Davis</DIV></DIV>

In director Dan Ireland's "slice of life , " Vincent D'Onofrio is a former porn star named Valentino ( how's that for subtle metaphor? ) who is slowly dying of AIDS. That's the least of your worries. He's also one third of a symbiotic ménage à trois that includes waitress girlfriend Mary Carmen ( an obnoxious Salma Hayek ) and fetishistic gigolo boyfriend Gary ( Thomas Jane , strutting like Madonna on valium ) . The movie comes across like some Midwestern housewife's salacious idea of what life is like "on the edge" -- teeming with drugs , wild dancing , and drag queens. There's even a deaf , transgendered , Patsy Cline - wannabe who , no kidding , gets hit by a car while trying to call for an ambulance. Ireland and screenwriter James Still make such an embarrassing show of being outrageous that it's almost offensive ; everybody is so busy being dangerously fabulous that nobody is even remotely human. -- Steve Wiecking</DIV></DIV>

As he faces his empty apartment -- and empty life -- he discovers that the burglar , Eddie Tesoro , has returned for a third time. They struggle violently , and Jimmy knocks Eddie unconscious.

But his quarry , a seven - footer ( Charles Gitona Maina ) he spots in an anthropology film , turns out to be the prince of his tribe who's in line for the crown and has no interest in becoming fodder for Sports Center. So it's up to the callous American to convince him that he wants to give this all up to live in a dorm and chase coeds ( while , of course , honoring his ancestors ) . Unfortunately , the jokes are stale and the basketball footage is nothing to get excited about. -- Marshall Fine</DIV></DIV>

Ray Liotta stars as a medical examiner who is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. A possible solution is found in neurobiologist Linda Fiorentino's experimental serum , which transfers memories from one person to another -- even from the deceased. Liotta injects himself with the serum , which allows him harrowing glimpses into other people's minds. But while each dose brings him closer to identifying the killer , it also puts him one step nearer to death. Dahl keeps the film moving briskly and wraps it in noirish photography , but he's let down by Bill Geddie's script , which asks viewers to swallow some implausible notions ( the instantaneous success of the experimental serum , for one ) . -- Paul Gaita</DIV></DIV>

Sherman McCoy knows how to make a lot of money. But that's about it. He is oblivious to his wife , his daughter , even his mistress , and shows little interest even in the deeper machinations of business. His focus is on the surface , and when he makes a mistake , it seems that all the dark forces he was so ignorant about circle like a pack of wolves. As usual , Wolfe writes ferociously , showing no favorites among the rich , the poor , the black , or the white and painting each with at least one absurd stroke. The novel is both hilarious and telling , delivered in a distinctive voice by Wolfe , one of our top stylists.</DIV></DIV>

Wells story was filmed again for this graphic 1996 version. The film was roasted by critics , but it's an utterly fascinating failure , largely due to the performances of David Thewlis , Val Kilmer , and especially Marlon Brando in the title role as a mad ( and in this case outrageously bizarre ) scientist whose experiments in crossbreeding humans with animals have gone terribly awry. Thewlis plays the wayward scholar who is rescued at sea by Kilmer and brought to Moreau's island to discover the doctor's unnatural "children." Fairuza Balk plays Moreau's half - cat daughter , but it's Brando and Kilmer ( in one scene doing a killer Brando impersonation ) who steal the show , along with the astounding makeup effects created by Stan Winston. A guilty pleasure by any measure , this movie has definite cult - favorite potential , and in addition to offering a "director's cut" with previously unseen footage , the DVD includes audio commentary by director John Frankenheimer , who replaced the original director on short notice and completed this film under highly stressful conditions. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Martin Henderson plays Cary , a speed king and relatively civilized outlaw with a knack for annoying everyone , including drug smugglers , the FBI , an ex - girlfriend , and , worst of all , biker gang leader Trey ( Ice Cube ), who thinks Cary killed his brother. On the run from everyone , Cary survives by playing all sides against one another. But the story is less important than the frantic , over - the - top , tongue - in - cheek action surrounding it.

Their memories were supposedly wiped clean , but flashbacks occur to remind them of their bitter hatred ( Lundgren committed wartime atrocities ; Van Damme had tried to stop him ), and the warriors resume their tenacious battle while a journalist ( Ally Walker ) uncovers the truth about the secret UniSol program.

Trapped in a suburban Hell with an alcoholic stepfather ( the always nasty Michael Ironside ), suffering , molested high - schooler Rosanne ( Monica Keena ) begs her quarterback boyfriend ( James DeBello ) to help her bump him off. Things get complicated with the involvement of her weary mother ( scrappy Ellen Barkin , still waiting for a decent role ) and a sensitive , outsider classmate ( Vincent Kartheiser ) . Larry Gross's script has Barkin's selfish character acting too much the idiot , though you won't hear a bad note from her or the rest of the appealing young cast ( the invaluable Jeffrey Wright also has a nice bit as Barkin's lover ) . Even if director Rob Schmidt has too much of an MTV sensibility ( showy cuts , booming soundtrack , etc. ) and indulges himself with the gruesome murder , his glossy sensitivity to teen trauma redeems some of the pulp. The film can be seen in widescreen on DVD , as well as heard in French and Spanish. -- Steve Wiecking</DIV></DIV>

He's had enough of this life , but when a mobster ( Harry Guardino ) comes along to make him an offer he can't refuse , Philo must use his wits as well as his fists to get himself out of yet another jam. The humor is thin and sporadic ( though Gordon is in fine form ), and Eastwood has since gone on to better things ; but a film that features a brawl with a monkey and a motorcycle gang can't be all bad. -- Robert Lane</DIV></DIV>

The coven , led by the thick - browed Jonathan Corbis ( Ernest Borgnine ), are also determined to get their hands on a diabolical Book of Names which contains the identities of those victims. After the family of Tom Preston ( Tom Skeritt ) are murdered by the coven for concealing the book , Tom sets out to avenge them. During an outrageous climax -- in which none other than William Shatner is offered up in sacrifice and Borgnine is transformed by a lightning bolt into a chunky horned demon -- the receptacle of souls is shattered , releasing the title storm and causing the congregation to melt into puddles of multicolored goo ( a scene which seems to last forever ) . Produced in 1975 but released two years later , this film touted John Travolta's name at the height of his popularity , though his role is remarkably small ( he does melt nicely at the end , however ) .~ Cavett Binion , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

Unfortunately , the film proves an interesting disaster at best , certain to leave fans of noir director Bob Rafelson ( Blood and Wine ) wondering what happened. Samuel L. Jackson plays lonely police detective and amateur cellist Jack Friar , whose search for a missing girl results in being taken captive by a motley gang of dreamers , lost souls , and psychopaths on the eve of a bank heist. Left alone with an armed but sympathetic , Russian - classical - pianist - turned - femme - fatale ( Milla Jovovich ), Jack finds someone to save. But the film's credulity is lost when Rafelson fails to convince us that Jack's honor - bound refusal to escape , despite a prime opportunity while nuzzling the defenseless Milla , is a good and honorable thing. One can feel authentic Hammett themes stirring here , but it's not enough. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

A fictionalized account in four segments , three of the segments parallel events in Mishima's life with his novels ( THE TEMPLE OF THE GOLDEN PAVILLION , KYOKO'S HOUSE , and RUNAWAY HORSES ), while the fourth depicts November 25 , 1970 , the last day of his life , a day in which he committed two puzzling , stunning acts -- one political , one deeply personal. MISHIMA is an amazing , disturbing multidimensional character study whose stunning visual splendor is supported by a riveting score by Philip Glass.

Brooks , sporting a paunch and a beat - up straw hat , stars as Al Percolo , a disheveled , down - but - not - out New York Yankees scout. His latest sensation , a high school phenom , blows his Yankee stadium debut after he unceremoniously throws up on the mound. Al is not fired , but instead banished to the backwaters of Mexico , where he discovers his own Babe Ruth and ticket back to the majors : local sensation Steve Nebraska , who has a 100 m.p.h. fastball and a titanic swing. As winningly played by Brendan Fraser , he is also an incredible screwball , part Encino Man and part George of the Jungle The Yankees are willing to pay the outrageous salary of $55 million ( those were the days! ) for him. But first he must get a clean bill of mental health. That won't be easy for a guy prone to throw dinnerware at the press. In a scene that recalls Brooks's increasingly desperate lobbying to get casino owner Garry Marshall to return the nest egg his wife squandered in Lost in America , Brooks strikes out in his attempts to get Steve's psychiatrist , Dr. H. Aaron ( Dianne Wiest ), to rubber - stamp the case. As Al becomes a surrogate father to the troubled youth , Dr. Aaron uncovers dark secrets from his past. While perhaps not in the same league as Bull Durham , The Scout will be a hit with everyone who loves baseball and Brooks ( not to mention Brendan ) . -- Donald Liebenson</DIV></DIV>

Just a Kiss slips to and fro in time and veers in and out of rotoscope animation , but even the live sequences have a cartoonish edge ; it's hard to care about what happens to these caricatures , no matter how tight their pants or how skimpy their tank tops.

But as the only child of the President of the United States , every detail of Anna's life is constantly monitored by the media , the public and her very protective parents -- who are backed up by a battalion of Secret Service agents that safeguard Anna from any danger , including the perils of first dates. Charming and irreverent , Anna just wants the freedom to live life like any other teenager -- which means ditching the agents who are seriously curbing her good times. While on a diplomatic trip to Europe with her parents , Anna extracts a promise from her father , the President , which allows her a night alone , unescorted. But when her dad has a change of heart , Anna decides to take things into her own hands. In a wild escape , incognito Anna meets mysterious stranger Ben Calder , who reluctantly aids her European getaway. Reveling in her newfound independence , Anna decides to take Europe by storm , accompanied by the ever - so - dashing Ben. As Anna's madcap European adventure takes her farther from her family and brings her closer to Ben , she's dreading the day her holiday will come to an end. Because the most powerful man in the free world is her father , Anna knows that she has a lot more to worry about than getting grounded. But before she can face the President , she has to find a way tell Ben the truth about her identity and risk getting her heart broken -- the one thing her father can't fix.</DIV></DIV>

Robin Williams stars as 10 - year - old Jack , a boy with an inexplicable disease that ages him at four times the normal human rate. Kept at home like a contemporary Boo Radley , Jack becomes a neighborhood legend until his parents relent and send him to school. In time , the other kids befriend him and stay loyal as his hyperdevelopment puts a strain on his body and emotions. The idea is sound , but the execution is a bore. The best the script and Coppola can come up with are painfully long scenes in which Williams's character proves himself on the playground and in gross - out contests in a tree house. Coppola fishes around for signs of life and spontaneity in these scenes , but the film is actually best when Jack has to cope with certain feelings in his mature body ( such as his attraction to a character played by Fran Drescher ) that he isn't prepared for emotionally. Jack would have been a lot better if Coppola had embraced a plan from beginning to end and stuck to it. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Before that fated space trip , Spencer ( Johnny Depp ) and Jillian ( Charlize Theron ) were a sunny , happy couple with matching blonde hairdos and a predilection for romping in the sack from extremely clever camera angles. However , after a communications blackout brings Spencer and his partner back down to earth prematurely , things are a little... peculiar. Spencer's partner goes bonkers and has a heart attack ; on top of that , the partner's wife takes a fatal shower with a plugged - in radio. Getting out of the space biz , Spencer accepts a job as a corporate exec in New York , and as a welcome to the Big Apple for his comely wife , he molests her at the company cocktail party. Soon enough , Jillian is pregnant , but as you might expect , this pregnancy ( twins , don't you know ) is a little... unusual. Writer - director Rand Ravich takes his sweet time getting from extremely obvious plot point A to even more obvious plot point B , stretching out the development particulars in mind - numbing , suspense - killing fashion. Even Joe Morton , as a sinisterly psychotic NASA official , can't liven things up -- you know you're in bad thriller territory when the biggest scare comes from a light suddenly being switched off. Theron , sporting a Mia Farrow - Rosemary's Baby haircut , sleepwalks beautifully through the movie , but she did this role much , much better in The Devil's Advocate. Depp , with a cornpone Southern accent , is about as realistic as his peroxided hair. Ravich does the viewer no favors with a hackneyed ending straight out of a B - grade paperback horror novel in which the most shocking moment is Theron's sudden emergence as a brunette. With Blair Brown as a jaded socialite who offers to help out Theron by providing do - it - yourself abortion pills , and a lovely Donna Murphy as the suicidal wife who figures it all out before everyone else. -- Mark Englehart</DIV></DIV>

Selleck plays a successful mystery novelist who cures a persistent case of writer's block by visiting the courtroom trial of a young Romanian woman named Nina ( played by late '80s supermodel Paulina Porizkova ) who has been accused of murder. He supplies the alleged murderer with an alibi -- she can claim she was having an affair with him at his Connecticut country home at the time of the murder -- and then he brings her to Connecticut to make the alibi look legitimate. Is she in fact a killer? Did she serve poisoned casserole to a group of dinner guests? You'd have to be a major fan of Selleck or Porizkova to want to find out what happens next , because despite a few light moments of engaging comedy this is the kind of nonsensical fluff that quickly wears out its welcome. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

The court of late - 18th - century France is ruled by Marie Antoinette ( Joely Richardson ), whose confidence and favor is yearned for by Jeanne de la Motte - Valois ( Hilary Swank ), a young woman stripped of her title and orphaned at a young age. As flashbacks repeatedly remind the audience , Jeanne is essentially pure at heart even as she takes up with a court gigolo ( Simon Baker ) and enacts the intricate scheme from which the title is drawn. Soon embroiled in Jeanne's plan to win back her rightful place in the world are her avaricious husband of convenience , Nicolas ( Adrien Brody ); the soon - to - be - disposed - of Marie Antoinette ; the salacious Cardinal Rohan ( Jonathan Pryce ); a necklace of questionable taste ; and a host of other players. All the makings for a hilarious romp ( à la Ridicule ) are in place , but director Charles Shyer , with his lavish budget in tow , wants the film to be taken seriously. Only Christopher Walken , in a hilarious turn as the fraudulent soothsayer Count Cagliostro , sees through the facile script and relishes his part in what will no doubt prove a colossal flop. -- Fionn Meade</DIV></DIV>

However , he has little use for the government , and after putting a playfully insulting statement on a government form , he's been banished from official music making. He ekes out a living by giving private lessons , painting gravestones with gold leaf , and performing at funerals. Louka also likes to chase younger women , a surprisingly number of whom are more than happy to be caught. However , when a friend suggests marriage to a stranger , Louka is unexpectedly willing to consider the matter. It seems that Broz ( Ondrej Vetchy ), a gravedigger and a good friend of Louka's , has a niece , Nadezda ( Irena Livanova ), with a young son who wants to stay in Czechoslovakia. However , she's a Russian citizen and lacks the proper papers. In order to stay , the young mother needs to marry a Czech citizen , and she and her aunt are willing to pay a husband for his troubles. Louka , hard up for cash and in need of a used car , grudgingly agrees to the arrangement and weds Nadezda. However , once she has her papers , Nadezda heads for West Germany to be with her boyfriend , and after her aunt unexpectedly dies , Louka finds himself in custody of his new stepson , six - year - old Kolya ( Andrei Khalimon ) . A confirmed bachelor , Louka knows next to nothing about taking care of a child , and he discovers that parenthood cramps his style with the ladies. However , Louka and Kolya soon become good friends , and Louka finds his outlook on life beginning to change , just as the Velvet Revolution sounds the call of a new era in Czechoslovakia. Kolya won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe as Best Foreign Language Film of 1997.~ Mark Deming , All Movie Guide</DIV></DIV>

The TV series depicts the modest adventures of Pok�mon trainer Ash Ketcham and his friends Brock and Misty as they roam an imaginary world , fighting matches and making friends. The features add elaborate CG effects that don't mesh with the flat , drawn characters , and over - scaled threats that feel beyond Ash's abilities to resolve. Forty years ago , Sam , a young trainer , meets the 251st Pok�mon Celebi ( it looks like Tinkerbell with a goldfish for a head ) . To escape a mean hunter , Celebi brings Sam to the present day , where they meet Ash & Company. They also meet the evil Iron Mask Marauder who's supposed to be a member of Team Rocket , but who's much nastier than the comically inept Jessie , James , and Meowth. The Marauder corrupts Celebi with a "dark ball" and forces it to create a monster out of trees , branches , etc. , that is blatantly copied from the Night Walker in Princess Mononoke. Ash and his friends eventually save the day , the Pok�mon , and the forest -- but it all feels like we've been there / done that. -- Charles Solomon</DIV></DIV>

Mill's job is to hear story pitches from screenwriters and decide which films have the potential to get made and which films get rejected. His job is suddenly in danger , though , when up - and - comer Larry Levi ( Peter Gallagher ) begins work at the studio. Rumors swirl that Griffin may be replaced soon by Levi. Griffin has also been receiving threatening postcards , presumably from a disgruntled writer whose pitch he rejected.Griffin delves through records and surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane ( Vincent D'Onofrio ), who had previously pitched a script to him. Griffin calls Kahane's home and is told by a woman , June ( Greta Scacchi ), that Kahane is at a movie theatre. Griffin goes to the theatre in Pasadena and offers Kahane a scriptwriting deal , hoping this will stop the threats. However , Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Griffin's offer. He denies that he sent Griffin any postcards. Kahane pushes Griffin in the parking lot and the two men scuffle. In a rage , Griffin accidentally kills Kahane. Thinking fast , Griffin makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day at work , he receives another postcard , confirming that his stalking writer is still at large. Griffin attends Kahane's funeral and connects with Kahane's girlfriend , June. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel ( Fred Ward ) confronts Griffin about the murder and says that Pasadena Police know Griffin was the last one to see Kahane alive. Pasadena detectives Susan Avery ( Whoopi Goldberg ) and DeLongpre ( Lyle Lovett ) suspect that Griffin is guilty of murder. They question him and DeLongpre starts to keep an eye on Griffin. The stalking writer leaves a rattlesnake in Griffin's car , causing a near - death experience that makes Griffin realize how he has sudden and deep feelings for June. With his girlfriend Bonnie out of town , Griffin takes June to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship grows.Meanwhile , with Levi ever encroaching on his job , Griffin sees an opportunity to save his position. He hears a pitch idea from two writers about a film called Habeas Corpus and instantly recognizes huge problems with the downbeat story. However , he manages to convince Levi that the pitch is golden and the movie will be a guaranteed Oscar contender. Griffin plans to let Levi shepherd the film through production and have it flop miserably. Then Griffin will step in at the last moment and suggest some basic changes to salvage the film's box office potential , letting him reclaim his position at the studio. The Pasadena detectives call Griffin in for a lineup after a witness to Kahane's death comes forward. Griffin catches a big break when the witness identifies the wrong man , Detective DeLongpre , who was placed in the lineup with the other suspects.One year later , studio power players are watching the end of Habeas Corpus with its tacked - on upbeat ending. Griffin's plan to "save" the movie worked like a charm and he is now a studio executive. While driving home , he gets a pitch over the phone from a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer.

Using more than a thousand uncompromising and exclusive photographs taken by former US Marine Captain Brian Steidle during his role as a military observer with the African Union , the tragic impact of an Arab government bent on destroying its black African citizens is exposed. As an official military observer , Steidle had access to parts of the country that no journalist could penetrate. He was unprepared for what he would witness and experience , including being fired upon , taken hostage , and being unable to intervene to save the lives of young children. Ultimately frustrated by the inaction of the international community , Steidle resigned and returned to the US to expose the images and stories of lives systematically destroyed. Haunted by what he has seen and the backlash against his advocacy efforts , Brian traveled to the refugee camps of Chad to reconnect with survivors of the violence he witnessed.</DIV></DIV>

( Yada , yada... ) It should come as no surprise that the film is made by the team that created Airplane! and the Naked Gun comedies. High School High is built upon the same brand of goofy , jokey humor , with gags about campus vending machines that dispense malt liquor and milk cartons with the assistant principal's face printed on the side. The story involves Lovitz's efforts to raise his students' grades while coping with criminals and falling for a fellow instructor ( Tia Carrere ) . The film loses its novelty after a short while and the jokes begin to feel less and less funny until you're begging for the end. But the first part of the movie -- when the premise is being set up -- is pretty good. -- Tom Keogh</DIV></DIV>

Dean's brother Eric , who has already seen his share of combat , plans to take Dean to enlist in his beloved Marine Corps in hopes of keeping an eye on him rather than letting him take his chances at the local induction center. But Dean's plans do not coincide with his older brothers. Instead , he plans to confront Eric about dodging the draft after the boys and their respective girlfriends , Bailey and Chrissie , head across Texas for a final fling of serious fun. Soon after their journey begins , the spirited foursome is spooked by a menacing pair of bikers , Holden and his girlfriend , Alex. When Alex chases the group's jeep , propelling them into a serious accident , Chrissie is thrown from the vehicle. As Alex attempts to rob the injured trio , Sheriff Hoyt arrives on the scene and turns the tables on their would - be assassin. While Chrissie hides in the nearby brush , she watches as the sheriff kills Alex in cold blood and then inexplicably taunts her friends before ordering them into the back of the patrol car. Unbeknownst to Chrissie , Hoyt is headed back to the Hewitt family home where Thomas who is being groomed to become the terrifying monster known as Leatherface and the rest of the Hewitt clan await.</DIV></DIV>

The predominantly black - and - white film features a banquet dance sequence in color. Obviously the two parts must be viewed as a whole to be fully appreciated. Many film historians consider this period in Eisenstein's career less interesting than his silent period because of a sentimental return to archaic forms ( characteristic of Soviet society in the '30s and '40s ) . Perhaps it was just part of his maturity. -- Bill Desowitz</DIV></DIV>

Taking an uncharacteristic detour into nonsensical plot mechanics , director Mike Figgis expertly pushes buttons with this nerve - jangling but ultimately hackneyed story ( by Richard Jeffries ) about a documentary filmmaker ( Dennis Quaid ) who moves his wife ( Sharon Stone ) and two kids into a run - down rural mansion once owned by the family of a simmering ex - convict ( Stephen Dorff ), who's got secret reasons for wanting Quaid's family to leave. This rote potboiler wants to be as thrilling as Fatal Attraction , but it's more like Pacific Heights -- fun to watch as the tension escalates with Dorff's violent behavior , but seriously flawed as plot holes proliferate. With a few good shocks and slinky support from Juliette Lewis , it's perfectly enjoyable as a popcorn distraction , but maybe they should've called it Cold Creaky Manor instead. -- Jeff Shannon</DIV></DIV>

Pinker is sentenced to die in the electric chair , but the execution goes awry and more people are mysteriously killed. Jonathan realizes that Pinker has used black magic to transfer himself into electricity , able to travel through power lines into homes through television sets. Despite the skepticism of his police detective father ( Michael Murphy ), only Jonathan can track Pinker down and destroy him once and for all. Director Wes Craven combines his serial killer thriller with a dash of social criticism , satirizing the modern obsession with the media in ways similar to his later hit SCREAM. Horace Pinker is a tough slasher in the Freddy Krueger mode , making wisecracks between murders , making +SHOCKER a tense but funny horror movie , with appearances by John Tesh and Dr. Timothy Leary ( as a televangelist ) as well as a cameo by Craven himself. The film climaxes in a wild chase between Jonathan and Pinker through the dangerous television landscapes , a realm where anything can happen.</DIV></DIV>

Central to the film's intrigue are such brutal realities as guerrilla warfare and street kidnappings , both common in Columbia. To combat this , Hayata armed himself to the teeth -- like a latter - day cowboy -- and employed a posse of personal bodyguards.</DIV></DIV>

She washes , cooks , shops and cleans , and also entertains gentlemen callers behind closed doors. But gradually , as small , repeated steps in her routine begin to go awry , we sense that a larger shift may be in progress.</DIV></DIV>

The story line is familiar , to put it mildly , as car - thief and drug - courier Sandler is set up and busted by Wayans's undercover cop , a man he's come to trust with his life. Dozens of movies , including Quentin Tarantino's great Reservoir Dogs , have tilled this fallow field before. But for once we can actually feel the bonds connecting the two tough guys , and the pain of their falling out , even when the movie dawdles over repetitious squabbling scenes. Cinematographer - turned - director Ernest Dickerson ( Juice ) gives this modestly budgeted programmer an unusually high visual gloss , with punchy high - speed action scenes that recall the Hong Kong blowout work of John Woo. James Caan leers and glowers entertainingly as a criminal mastermind , and lynx - eyed Kristen Wilson makes a dazzling femme fatale. -- David Chute</DIV></DIV>
