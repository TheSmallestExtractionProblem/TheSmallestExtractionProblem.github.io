D - They actually have a number of programs to offer , and it is all very enticing , but once you get to your ONE class , with the same teacher and sit in there for 4 - 6 hours each day , it gets boring. I wonder if these professors even have a teaching degree because in my experience , all my teacher did was read from the book. She was not a good public speaker , and was very unprofessional. Lots of people have complained about her ; nothing has been done. Overall very disappointing. I am withdrawing from the school. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience ctorres102010 Health Care Professions - Austin '12 Radiologic Technician Jan 07 , 2011 Facilities Are OK C+ They have a small library with books related to healthcare , and a few computer labs , also break room and easy access to Northwest Mall food court. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources bravotheking Health Care Professions - Austin '10 Radiologic Technician Sep 22 , 2010 Don't Do It F the education recieved was the worse ever.We spent days without teachers , watching movies and just reading out the books wih no explanation of what we were learning. On numerous occassions students left early and also many of the students would come to class under the influence of drugs.I attended this school under full fianancing , after 1 month i grew ill and was undergoing many test with doctors.I provided the office as well as my teachers with doctors notes.My condition grew worse so i sat down with a counsler and explained i could not attend at the moment anymore due to my illness.The counsler assured me that was fine and my down payment would be non refundable but the rest would be taken care of and no balance would be owed since i left within 30 days and recieved no books , and i would be elegible to return to school when my health was better. 2 months later i get a call from the human resources office informing me i owed the school almost 3000.00 dollars for the month i was there. I explained what happened and they informed me the counsler whos name is bobby was terminated and there was no record of our discussions or agreement.I informed them i was only there for a month , recieved no books or any matierals and missed numurous days due to my health condition.They didnt care. They said all my loans were revoked from governemt and i owed them the money , I refused to pay.Now every night i get a call from a man in Houston TX by the name of Mr Parish whom when i call back never answers or hangs up on me.Today i get a call from Mr. Parish on behalf of Academy of Health Care Proffessions saying i owe the money and if i do not pay up he'll come adter me , so now im getting threatened.Please do yourself a favor and never enroll in this school it is a joke and a scam , they do not teach , support , or care about their students , they just care about the money. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Comparable Schools Allied Health Careers Everest Institute Southern Careers Inst.

There are several unique features about this university which none other university provides for all the candidates without any differentiation. This university has the facility of providing the nearest Learning centre which will be very convenient to us. The weekend classes are very useful for working candidates. The LC provides books and learning materials on time. The faculty of the university are very friendly and helpful to the candidates , clearing doubts very easily in an understanding manner. The fee structure is very reasonable to meet the financial constraints. The university gave me a toll free number , which provided immediate information regarding my doubts , course , fee structure , duration , eligibility criteria and even the LC details. At this juncture of point , I have to mention about a very interesting and useful programme - ‘EDUNXT’. ‘EDUNXT’ - an online programme , which none other university provided till date. It gave me a great deal of benefits , where I could chat with university faculties directly and could get study materials online. I feel SMU is the best among all universities in Distance Education in India , guiding and preparing the students to face the Tomorrow’s world. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

The faculty listens to input from the students and helps to improve different features available to students. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience unluckyme AmeriTech - Draper '10 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Aug 26 , 2010 Teachers and Registration...UGH D There are a few teachers at Ameritech that are GREAT , but they are few and far between how terrible the rest of the staff is. Some teachers base the load of work on whether they like your class or not and teach and grade off of emotions , which is extremely unprofessional. Many of the nursing instructors haven't a clue what they are doing and therefore cannot teach the students anything. For a school that is trying so hard to become accreditied , it is surprising to me that they keep on with these teachers that are obviously bringing this school down. Our class registration process is a joke. I could not truly describe what a mess it is to you unless you already attend Ameritech - and then you would already know how it is anyway ;) 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience unluckyme AmeriTech - Draper '10 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Aug 26 , 2010 Not Flexible at All for the Student F It is very difficult to transfer credits to this school. The classes had to have been taken within the last 5 years and even if they were , it is still a fight to get the college to accept them because they want to make as much money off of each student as they possibly can. The schedules are not flexible at all. The student has very little say on what class dates / times and clinicals they prefer. There is a lot of frustration trying to register for each new semester. Wouldn't recommend this school just for that reason alone although I also have PLENTY more reasons for not recommending them to others. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Still Have Questions?

'13 Business Administration and Management Sep 02 , 2010 Online Experience A - Online courses have their challenges at times due to Computer Mediated - Communication ( CMC ) . So far the experience with online courses have been great but could be better. The interaction with other students is great because it allows you to learn from others and see things from different perspectives. The online experience can hinder your learning experience as well but the blame cannot be on the other students fully. The diversity of cultural differences play a major role in online courses because there is no face - to - face communication. Some students have jobs and may not post on time , some students may not have the same learning abilities as others , and communicating online can be difficult due to how other students perceive other students postings ; such as using proper nettiquette. The interaction with the professors have been great because the professors participates in the discussions with the students and provide different points of views to the students for the students to discuss. The registration process has been excellent due to the fact that for there is a ticket / time for students to go online and register for classes. Also the student academic advisor is to be called within the ticket access time in which the academic advisor ensures that the student picks the necessary classes the student needs to acheive their goal. Online course sometimes provide a heavy workload for students since their is no face - to - face communication or class time with students and the professor. However , this is not for all classes. So for the workload online has been okay and the time for submission has been very flexible. Also you can communicate with the professor if more time is needed to submit the assignment due to your job or other personal related issues that hinders the student to submit on time. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Online Courses covybaby23 Argosy - Washington D.C.

A first term student's body of work may not be the most impressive , but present it well and it makes all the difference. As for financial aid , Art Center gives out a decent amount. I've talked to many of my fellow first term classmates and most are on scholarship. However , be sure to keep the GPA high and enter those reviews. It's the only way you can get money from the school. Outside of school scholarships are also offered and the financial aid office is more than willing to help with private loans and offering resources for students to find other means of scholarship and aid. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Scholarships First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last Comparable Schools CCA Otis Art & Design Pratt Institute RISD side - by - side comparison California College of the Arts Location : San Francisco , CA Tuition : $34 , 872 Room & Board : $9 , 850 Student Body Size : 1 , 299 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Otis College of Art & Design Location : Los Angeles , CA Tuition : $31 , 360 Room & Board : $11 , 800 Student Body Size : 1 , 141 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Pratt Institute Location : Brooklyn , NY Tuition : $34 , 880 Room & Board : $9 , 756 Student Body Size : 3 , 000 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Rhode Island School of Design Location : Providence , RI Tuition : $36 , 659 Room & Board : $10 , 846 Student Body Size : 1 , 940 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

BJ's functions as a sleezy diploma mill , once you pay your money , they have no interest in teaching you. often , there are no qualified teachers on the floor , which is a state board violation. there is open drug dealing on the 'campus' and most of the students have just been released from jail. I wasted my money attending this school , save yours : go to a real city to learn like seattle and go to a real school , not 'ghetto u'. BJ's daughter runs the sister school and she is even more mean spirited and corrupt than her mother. the school is bigoted , racially , and also is highly genderphobic and homophobic.

There are a ton of different classes to take to fulfill your core curriculum as well , from theater to volleyball to lifespan development psychology. The only bad thing is some of the instuctors have been a bit hard to follow , I get the feeling they have other jobs and this one is not their top priority at times because of their scattered assignments.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades esummer Bradford School - Columbus '12 Paralegal Nov 12 , 2010 Misleading D+ At first I was happy to start this school and its paralegal program because of its claims of an intense curriculum. I soon found out there were things not discussed in the initial interviews. First , they have a very strict dress code and will send you home and mark you absent for the day if violated. This can be costly if you dont own the clothes they favor. Second , if you fail a single class , you automatically get booted from the school for a year. You may as well withdraw after that. Third , the class schedules are fixed and unchangeable , starting as early as 8am and ending as late as 4pm. This can be a huge hassle if you plan to work while going to school. For half the classes I had , we watched movies and took tests on the movies. Some of the movies we watched were Joe Dirt , Wallstreet , The Pursuit of Happiness , 12 Angry Men , and Crash. Is that what you consider higher education? The director even told us that if we missed a certain amount of days , she would call our parents and notify them. I am 25 years old , and some of the other students were in their 40s. That was extremely inappropriate for her to say. They also shown me suspicious financial organization , and an obscure line between whether or not they actually are accredited to give associates DEGREES.

The quality of the ladies has dropped. Most of the women being accepted exhibit little class and are very loud with sometimes foul language. The campus is divided into greek life and other. If you are not greek then you are not really a part of the majority of the campus. Greek life does not mean it will make life better , it is actually better to save your money and pay it towards the school because you need every penny you have at this school. Really look at you program. Some majors are better than others and the sooner you discover this the faster you can trasfer because credits do not trnasfer easily to other schools.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades T14W19 Butler Comm '13 Social Work and Youth Services Jan 22 , 2011 Good Athletic Facilities A - As a student - athlete , I can say that there are good athletic facilities on campus. The soccer field and practice football fields , located on the southern end of the campus , aren't bad and the two gyms are still in good shape. The training room is way bigger than most of the training rooms I've seen on other community college campuses and there are multiple weight rooms in the same building as the gyms. For me what solidifies the A rating for athletic facilities is the Champions Training Center or CTC. Inside is a great weight room , with a big enough turf field for small - sided training. If you happen to be a football player , there's an added bonus in the fact that you also have an entire section dedicated to your sport in the form of a trophy hall and locker rooms. Not bad. Not bad at all. By the way , new facilities are on the way , such as a new stadium for football , and a new soccer facility. I have really enjoyed using these facilities on campus. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources taylorf2010 Butler Comm '10 Special Education and Teaching Jan 15 , 2011 A Great Place to Get Started A - This school is a great place to start out at when you get out of high school.

The campus has been undergoing renovations throughout the past year - but it has been worth it. The new classrooms are much nicer ( some of the campus was still stuck in the 70's ), and the Student Success Center ( which includes the book store , registration , and more ) is a great place to hang between classes. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources EnglishNerd09 Butler County '13 English Sep 11 , 2010 Helpful.

There is an unspoken courtesy for each other because it is a samller school and you will see people you know everywhere. Professors are always willing to spend extra time with you and if you need help there is a way to get it. One of my favorite things about Butler is the mix it is between a small school and a large one.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades roobearr Kaplan - Lincoln '10 Education Jun 13 , 2010 The on Campus Classes Have Been Very Flexible D I do not have a problem with the on campus classes and I enjoy them very much. I find the professors to be friendly , educated , and fair in their criticisms. Once again , the reason for the low grade is because of the online classes. I also have problems with how much my school costs. I am in the same city as our State University and two other major colleges and my little school has the highest tuition. I have also found out that my school's credits won't transfer. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility roobearr Kaplan - Lincoln '10 Education Jun 13 , 2010 Accelerated Degree Programs Are Great B I like that it doesn't take a full two years to get my degree.

When I was on campus , I carried a 4.0 GPA but that dropped to a 3.65 after beginning the online classes. I find it hard to get involved in a subject when I am looking at a computer screen. I have also had problems with contacting the instructors with questions or concerns. On campus , when I have a question I am able to go to the person face to face and get an immediate response. With my online classes I send an email and in some cases it has been up to a week before I get a response. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

Also by word of mouth of those who have taken them it is not the best idea if I really want to learn the material. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Online Courses chuncher Kent State Trumbull '12 Business Dec 20 , 2010 Simplicity at Its Finest. B+ Most classes thus far are held more than once per day. If I can not attend one due to conflict with my schedule I have always been welcome to attend one at a different time. The last semester I attended my mother died of cancer. At that point it was too late to drop any classes without permission by the professor. My accounting professor understood the predicament I was in and dismissed me from the class. The only complaint I have was being convinced to take classes such as 'Study Strategies' which were nothing more than common knowledge and a waste of money. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility chuncher Kent State Trumbull '12 Business Dec 20 , 2010 Rebirth of Hope. B Due to personal financial hardships in 2001 I decided to take a hiatus from college. 9 years later here I am entering back into the world of higher education. I did attempt to work full time and attend classes full time simultaneously , but my GPA was suffering for it. However , after the company that I worked with for 9 years laid me off Kent State's admissions staff has welcomed me back with open arms and have made it as easy to enroll and schedule classes as if I had never left. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

A I have attended community colleges and a large university previously and have found Kettering College of Medical Arts a great place to be. There is a great mix of students from many different backgrounds and it seems that interaction with other students is promoted. There is a positive atmosphere about the school and it seems that there is a religious element at work as well. It seems that most students realize they are not just doing this for themselves , but working for a higher power. I am glad that I am here and I could only hope that my children will go to a school with this type of environment. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body danbeem33 Kettering Medical Arts '12 Sonographer and Ultrasound Technician Dec 29 , 2010 Worth the Price! A - While the tuition price may be high compared to some other schools , the educational experience is second to none. This is the only school in the state that prepares students for all four modalities in the ultrasound field , while most other schools only prepare students for two. The clinical experience is also first rate and gives students a taste for what will actually occur in the field. While the price is high , the educational and clinical experience obtained makes it worth the price. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 5 Next Last Still Have Questions?

The court reporting program costs nearly $30 , 000. The technology they use for their court reporting program is completely out - of - date. The staff there is very unfriendly and unhelpful. I would have left a long time ago , if it hadn't been for my teacher that was extremely nice. This educational institution , I feel , is only concerned with the bottom dollar and how much money they make from the student. They signed students up for classes we never authorized and then had to individually go and withdraw from to make sure we weren't charged. I would never go there if I knew what I know now. I would never recommend that anyone go there until things change. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

While this means we have bigger rooms and private bathrooms , we're somewhat secluded from the rest of campus life. The rooms in North Dorms are much smaller but they house the largest number of on campus students so you're likely to meet a lot of people. The various apartment options are fairly nice but they're all too far from the center of campus to be convenient. Newman is by far the worst with a combination of the smaller rooms of North and the secluded South Campus location of Basil's. Definitely the best housing is the Town Houses which are reserved for upperclassmen. They're large , comfortable , and close to the main campus. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing explorette La Salle '14 Marketing Jan 24 , 2011 Pretty Available A - While practically every student on campus has their own laptop , there are plenty of computers available for those without a laptop or whose laptop is broken. The library doesn't have many computers and they're generally pretty slow. The lab in the basement of Wister Hall is the largest and is only full at peak hours like free period. There are several labs in Holroyd Hall but they're frequently booked for classes. The real hidden gem is the small lab in College Hall. There are almost always computers available and they're very fast. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Computers kainj1 La Salle '11 Psychology Jan 24 , 2011 North Philadelphia C+ La Salle's immediate surrounding area would earn in F in anyone's book. Step one foot off campus and you are at risk to getting mugged at the very least. Nary a student living off campus hasn't gotten robbed , and those who intend to walk on foot down a street after midnight should think again. Then again , assuming you can get a shuttle driver to drive you to the subway stop , the whole city is at your disposal. Philly has a great music scene , with the TLA , Troc , and First Unitarian all reachable. The Phillies , Flyers , and Eagles are always causing some action down at the stadiums. And there are a ton of restaurants - a TON - to go to downtown. If you can make it down there , do it. If not , don't bother walking around off campus.

If you want to eat out , that is. There is a Pavilions about five minutes away , which is much affordable. Of course , if you're in the mood to drive 10 minutes away , there's a Stater Bros ( you couldn't ask for better prices ) . 1 2 3 4 5 Report Off - Campus Dining karsenslater Laguna Art & Design '12 Illustration Jan 12 , 2011 Pretty Much Secure A Neither I nor anyone I know has ever had a safety issue at LCAD. The biggest instance of crime occurs about once a semester , when a student borrows school equipment and neglects to tell anyone or return it for a week or two. Small things like pencils and paint left overnight will probably be taken , but belongings like computers and backpacks have always been returned to the front office. Flooding and mudslides can be a problem sometimes since the school is midway down the canyon , but these inconveniences on campus are always reversed before they become a problem for students. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Health & Safety First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Comparable Schools Maryland Inst.

D I will not choose this school ever again. The guys to girls ratio is really bad ( about 5 : 1 ) . There are too many unreasonable restrictions set for the students , such as limited bandwidth usage , network filter restricting students' network access , no social dancing , insanely strict fire codes , visitors of different gender are only allowed in the dorm during weekends with some restrictions ( doors have to be opened , lights have to be ON ), no alcohol consumption even individual above 21. The campus security cares more about giving out tickets to student than looking out for undesired 'visitors.' The students should be allowed decide and be responsible for themselves as part of the process of growing instead of being controlled by the administrators having all sorts of unnecessary rules set for the students. Most of the people , especially the professors and administrators are too conservative. There isn't anything going on in town and on campus , which makes the weekends really boring. The only good thing about this school is the class size and the academic programs. Most of the classes have only about 15 students , some larger classes may have up to about 30 students. The classes are really hard. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience jamestneoh LeTourneau '12 Aircraft Maintenance Jan 25 , 2011 The Administrators Need to Open up a Bit F There's basically no Greek Life in LeTourneau University. There aren't much going on in the Society Houses ( they have to be called this because the administration doesn't allow them to be called fraternities ) .

The workload was below what I expected , but the quality of the curriculum was sufficient. Degrees in Health Science , Environmental Science , and Early Childhood Development are all available at this school. Some credits are transferrable to four year colleges and Universities in Nebraska however Little Priest lacks a current transfer program. The professors are very supportive and definetely qualified , a true blessing for the students. After attending a semester it felt as if I was apart of a family with fellow students and faculty. The registration process is very straightforward and I always feel as if the advisors are truly committed to my success. The thing I appreciate the most about this school is the integration of Native American culture and language into the curriculum. Workshops about community health , spirituality , and natural medicines and food are always available. I will definetely miss this school when I graduate and I hope that it grows in the right direction. One of the biggest thing I hope to see at this school in the future is a cafeteria and atheletics program. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

Those are really nice , and inexpensive. The only thing that sucks is the fact you must pay the money upfront instead of being able to defer payments until you finacial aid awards come in. But , when your finacial aid checks do come in , you are free to move in. Space is always available there for you to move in there. Off campus options in the area are nice and top of the line as well. There is one apartment called Millicent Crossing nearby , which has a washer / dryer already installed in the apartments. They are really cheap , but they do check credit. There is one apartment behind the university called Bayou Rouge , they look sort of slummish from the outside , so I would not recommend that. You have to look around.

Also seeing nuns walk around was a bit eye opening. Everyone is more than willing to help another person out. It's wonderful. It was a big change coming from a cold , large campus to a tiny , tight knit , warm campus. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop eathaye Lourdes '11 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Oct 22 , 2010 Guys and Gals of Lourdes College A Most of the students are either dressed up or in sweats. Because it's a small school , there isn't a reason to impress anyone because everyone pretty much knows everyone else. Most of the population is very nice and accepting. A large percentage of the community is older ( non - traditional students ) . So many of the students have spouses and children and have decided to come back to school. I have never been amongst a nicer group of people. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Guys & Girls eathaye Lourdes '11 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Oct 22 , 2010 Security on Lourdes College Campus A+ I have never heard of any campus crime and I feel very secure on the campus.

The only problem is that there is a disconnect amongst White and Black Greek Letter Organizations. NOT integration , but we do not really understand each others' perspectives and the logistics behind each org. The White Greeks tend to bash each other more than the Black Greeks also.

They were always either a phone call , office visit or e - mail away. Another thing about the professors , is that they know what they are talking about and they keep the class interesting. Some of the workload is unnecessary , but worth it. During the registration process , LBWCC has an early registration day / time and a set day that the academic advisors are there to help you register. Then a regular registration time. It has definately made it easier having a early registration. The only small complaint I have about LBWCC is some instructors are not as understanding as others. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience sarahthompson Lurleen B Wallace '11 Education Jan 10 , 2011 Variety of Students A - There are a variety of types of students at LBWCC.

Downtown is close to the college. The school has a wonderful atmoshere , everyone knows everyone , professors get to know you one on one. At times safety maybe a concern in certain areas of the city but there is so much to do on campus you rarely have to venture out. Athletics are great there and continues with the small hometown feeling because the community comes out and supports you. The community also partners with the college in providing intern and externships for the students. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Local Atmosphere First Previous Page 1 of 8 Next Last Comparable Schools Muhlenberg College Stonehill College University of Pittsburgh West Chester Univ. of PA side - by - side comparison Muhlenberg College Location : Allentown , PA Tuition : $36 , 990 Room & Board : $8 , 440 Student Body Size : 2 , 352 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Stonehill College Location : Easton , MA Tuition : $31 , 210 Room & Board : $12 , 240 Student Body Size : 2 , 420 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of Pittsburgh Location : Pittsburgh , PA In - State Tuition : $14 , 154 Out - of - State Tuition : $23 , 852 Student Body Size : 16 , 719 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school West Chester Univ. of PA Location : West Chester , PA In - State Tuition : $7 , 211 Out - of - State Tuition : $15 , 543 Student Body Size : 10 , 844 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

For me , this couldn't be farther from the truth. His classes are strict , but he pushes me more than the other teachers , and I really respect that. He knows how much I can handle , so he dishes it out and challenges me. If I'm ever unsure of myself , he's right there cheering me on. He's really helped me pin - point my strenghts , and is accomodating to my weaknessess. He can be a little bossy at time , but that's just his personality , and not at all something he does to any one person. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop bschnabel Lyndon State '13 Illustration Oct 13 , 2010 Sometimes They're There - Sometimes They're Not C It all depends on what it is we're talking about. Public safty is pretty good at finding marijuana , and so there isn't a lot of that at the school. Kids are getting busted a lot for drinking , but there's always more that they miss , so it's obvious that there's a problem at the school. The ones that get caught though are usually pretty sorry and are more careful next time. I believe it's a fine , and then you have to create a poster about the dangers of alcohol abuse. Not strict enough. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness bschnabel Lyndon State '13 Illustration Oct 13 , 2010 Freshman Nightmare C My overall dorm experience my first year of college was enjoyable. I had never been on my own before , and so the freedom was great. The problem was that there were extreme amounts of underaged drinking. There were R.A.'s that were supposed to be watching students from making unhealthy choices , but the truth of the matter is that they were drunk themselves most of the time. There were also a lot of thefts , and the school's public safty did nothing to help. But aside from the 3am drinking parties , and stolen items , I found that I got along with everyone quite well. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Comparable Schools New England College Norwich University Plymouth State University New Hampshire side - by - side comparison New England College Location : Henniker , NH Tuition : $27 , 450 Room & Board : $9 , 626 Student Body Size : 932 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Norwich University Location : Northfield , VT Tuition : $27 , 370 Room & Board : $9 , 484 Student Body Size : 2 , 110 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Plymouth State University Location : Plymouth , NH In - State Tuition : $8 , 944 Out - of - State Tuition : $17 , 114 Student Body Size : 4 , 025 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of New Hampshire Location : Durham , NH In - State Tuition : $12 , 743 Out - of - State Tuition : $26 , 713 Student Body Size : 12 , 035 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

At MCC all of the required classes for my major approach mathematics from a different way. This is great because it allows me to not just know how to solve problems but understand the concept behind them as well. An additional bonus is that at MCC i am not just learning from a text book , I'm learning from actual experience.

Because it is a relatively small college there are lots of opportunities you would normally have to fight for at larger schools : internships , work study positions , holding a position on a student organization executive board , creating a new student group etc. Despite its shortcomings I have enjoyed my time at McKendree. The professors know you beyond your name and your grade in class. They take real interest in your development as a Bearcat. In fact , this is true for most McKendree employees from the maintenance crews to McKendree's President Dr. Dennis. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop bearcat10 McKendree '10 Communications Nov 07 , 2010 Only One Dining Company on Campus C Sodexho is the one and only dining services provider on campus. There are two places where hot food can be found at McKendree : the dining hall and the cafe. If you live on campus you must purchase a meal plan.

I've enjoyed my teachers , and the school has many programs that transfer credits to other school in state. One disappointment would be the speed at which we receive our financial aid money.

Equestrian '90 Equine Studies Dec 07 , 2010 Meredith Manor Experience F Meredith Manor facts : Been there , done that for 5 months , got straight A's , BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER...They have "gotcha" clauses in the contract to get more money out of you if you withdraw at any time sooner than your full program sign up. They feed seed corn ( ask your vet what he thinks about that insanity , they do it because it is cheap ), house students in converted steel , ocean shipping crates , 3 ratty old school buses where you have to bend down to walk around in , and the deluxe "converted" barn stalls where the gap under the doorways are large enough for rats , snakes , bugs of all kinds , etc. One bathroom had so much black mold on it that they closed it down...only after students complained REPEATEDLY and finally threatened to call the health department...Lot's of drinking and pot , no dorm supervision to speak of. Read the posts of others who have gone there over the years...I know of top young western riders who have taken national titles who got way messed up there both on technique and their backs... If this sounds too negative , just go see for yourself : Questions to ask : What do you feed the horses? What is your financial policy if you withdraw mid - program? Etc. Get other good questions to ask from people who've been there.

The lack of expense does not make up for the terrible quality of education I receive here. No one is involved in the campus , everyone attends class and then goes home , if they manage that much. The material isn't challenging whatsoever , and I am learning nothing I wasn't already taught ( more effectively ) at my old high school. Only go here if you have no other options. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility ktinoco Metropolitan - Maple Woods '14 Business Management Oct 12 , 2010 Transfer Student A At the end of my time at Maple Woods , I will transfer to a four year university.

It was a huge shock but I adapted to the situation. However one thing i have not adapted to is the fact that I am financially struggling. Now that I am a student I am more conservative on what I invest my money on. My College financial aid office has definitely been a huge help to my difficulties but now I need some scholarship money.

I had to complete the entire application process alone and Midlands Technical College seemed to have the easiest of them all.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades melodybsmall Midway '13 Psychology Aug 05 , 2010 All Girls and Horses A+ The biggest thing about Midway College is that it is an all girls school. There are an avrage of 5 men ( not teachers ) on campus every week and they are all taken. Basically , if you're not gay , you have to be really commited to the accidemic program. I ( being straight and single ) am finding it hard to survive socially , but I love the school for it's programs , and that's why I'm staying for at least the next year. Even so , most of the girls are awesome and a lot of fun. There's rarely a dull moment in our dorms! But , having 400+ girls together 24 / 7 means a LOT of drama. You have been warned. Oh , and , social scene? There is none. Off campus , there's nothing to do with out driving at least 20 minutes. "Downtown" Midway consists of a street with a railroad passing through it. There are about 10 cute shops , but that gets boring after about 2 weeks. However , if you're willing to make the drive , Versailles and Georgetown are 20 - 30 minutes away. But , if you're looking for something really fun , Louisville and Lexington ( and the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville ) are 30 - 45 minutes away. Academically , Midway is great. They've mastered balancing textbook knowladge with practical , real - life experiance and helping you into the "real" world with internships so that you will be in high demand by the time you get out of school. Their three staple programs are Teaching , Nursing , and Equine Studies. While they're mostly known for the horses , being one of the best Equine colleges in the nation , their other programs are wonderful as well , mostly for the reasons previously mentioned. Now , for the biggest reason that Midway is so popular : Horses. They own or lease over 70 horses , some of whom where trained to be the best in their division. In saddle , they specialize in Hunt Seat and Western Pleasure riding , but they also have a Reining program and a Dressage program. They have some of the best choaches in the nation , which makes for the best riders in the nation. The Midway College Intercolleget Horse Show Association teams are working towards being the best in state and then nation. Last year , the Hunt Seat team was 2nd in the state , losing by only a few points. Acedemically , they have an amazing Equine Management program , which prepares girls to run a barn themselves , and a wonderful Equine Therapy program , which includes massage therapy , chiropractic work , and acupunture for the horses , which is becoming a big bussiness especially around the racetracks and KY Horse Park in Lexington and Louisville. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop melodybsmall Midway '13 Psychology Aug 05 , 2010 Diverse as Possible A In the relm of diversity , Midway College excels. Except , of course , fact that it is an all girls school. Men are welcome on campus and to the online and graduate schools , but not to live on campus. In regard to racial , political , sexual orientation , religious , and socioeconomic acceptance , Midway strives to have absolutely no barriers between people. They even go to the extent of having an entire class dedicated to the fact. Students are forced to open their eyes to all other veiwpoints in order to be better , more fair people in the business and social worlds , and often to even argue the point of view oppisit of their own. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Diversity melodybsmall Midway '13 Psychology Aug 05 , 2010 Small Campus , Good People A Midway College is known for it's Teaching , Nursing and Equine programs. I was drawn to it for the Equine program , which is one of the best in the country. The very small campus size ( about 400 residents ) makes the classes very small and personal. All of the professors know your name by the third week. Some times , that's a bad thing , but usually it's good , because they can see your weaknesses and help you through them in the way that you need. Even the girls at Student Affairs know who you after a while! All you have to do is walk in and they'll hand you everything you need. It's great to work or even just hang out with them. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academics First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Comparable Schools Mount Vernon Nazarene Oregon Inst. of Tech Pacific Union College St. Mary's College MD side - by - side comparison Mount Vernon Nazarene Location : Mount Vernon , OH Tuition : $20 , 330 Room & Board : $5 , 890 Student Body Size : 1 , 736 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Oregon Institute of Technology Location : Klamath Falls , OR In - State Tuition : $6 , 570 Out - of - State Tuition : $18 , 090 Student Body Size : 2 , 093 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Pacific Union College Location : Angwin , CA Tuition : $23 , 979 Room & Board : $6 , 750 Student Body Size : 1 , 364 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school St. Mary's College of Maryland Location : Saint Mary's City , MD In - State Tuition : $11 , 325 Out - of - State Tuition : $22 , 718 Student Body Size : 1 , 935 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Being at a college who have dedicated teachers ( who want too see an individual suceeed ); makes my journey through this alot more pleasant. Being young , school seems to be a "have to".I dont think it quite prepares you for all the other unfortunate possibilities an individual may encounter.However , it will lead us in a more positive direction in preparing for "adulthood". And when many of us dont catch that the first time around , its wonderful that we can "go back" at 40 yrs of age.At 40 , its no longer a "have to" ; but a "PRIVILEGE". I enjoy college and this second chance. For all you younger people...PLEASE go to school and get ALL the education you can before you start reproducing. And for anyone a lil older ( lol ); its never too late for that second chance if you really want it ( no matter what your age or past is ) . 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience brandiehinson Moultrie Tech '11 Licensed Practical Nurse Training ( LPN ) Aug 03 , 2010 My School Has Large Variety A My school consist of a large variety of people.

While there are some very intelligent and hard working students at the college , the Mount will take almost anyone willing to give them money. In the case of my relative , she was an average to below average high school student and did very poorly in her first year at another college. They took her into the nursing program anyway , knowing her chances of succeeding in what is known as a tough major were slim to none. As expected , she was out after one semester. My friends that have gone to the Mount say that there is very little to do on the weekends and the faculty can be difficult to deal with.

It is also a drug free zone ; no tobacco allowed. On campus there are resident advisors , student directors and security guards who monitor drinking , drugs , and misconduct ( littering , breaking school property , parking in no - parking zones ) on campus. Students receive warnings and fines for being found drinking , with drugs , showing misconduct , and parking in no - parking zones and if a student continously does so he or she can be expelled from the school. The school is strict in a way that some students do not appreciate. Students often complain about parking rules being ludacris and drinking rules to be insane for those students who are 21 and older.

More activities are available in the summer months when students are not around which include camping , fishing , boating , and going to the beach are available. Attractions and activities that are available to students during the school year are bowling , going to the movie theater , taking walks / run on trails , going to local parks , and going out to eat. There is not a lot to offer for shopping , for example , the mall only has eight stores including clothing , shoes , accessories , sports goods , and electronics ; other than the mall , major stores that are offered include Wal - mart , K - mart , HyVee , Ace Hardware , and Sears. Also , there a few restaurants including fast food are available in town that students can afford. As far as safety , the town does have a small , comfortable feel to it ; however , there is a federal prison in town which some people may not feel safe with. Yankton has a good grasp on safety with its nearby police station and Mount Marty has school security guards as well as security cameras that offer and monitor safety and protection. As far as the local attitude toward students , it does not feel as though the town supports the college as much as it could. Support from the town mainly goes toward the local high school which has more students. Yankton needs to show more support to Mount Marty especially so the students can see it. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Local Atmosphere First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Comparable Schools Dordt College Morningside College Northwestern College - ... side - by - side comparison Dordt College Location : Sioux Center , IA Tuition : $22 , 080 Room & Board : $6 , 010 Student Body Size : 1 , 298 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Morningside College Location : Sioux City , IA Tuition : $22 , 020 Room & Board : $6 , 740 Student Body Size : 1 , 198 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Northwestern - Orange City Location : Orange City , IA Tuition : $22 , 240 Room & Board : $6 , 756 Student Body Size : 1 , 164 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Such fun is simply unheard of. This makes finding fun that more difficult. USC and UCLA are frequented by some students for a night out of fun. While others find clubs and L.A. bars to be more of a hot spot.

I hear it's a great school for nursing , but if you don't plan to major in nursing , save yourself some time and go somewhere else like Cal State. I believe that attending MSMC put me at a major disadvantage with the job market because of the lackluster quality of the education I received there. Honestly?

The Naropa Library bouts the name of Alan Ginsberg. And was founded in part by him. Naropa is Famous for its Summer Writing Program. The school also has a wide range of Guest Speakers : including the Dalai Lama , Danny Glover , and Robert Thurman. Its curriculum is a blend of experiential and book based , encouraging discussion , debate and exploration. It runs deep into the student and turns them inside it. This is definitely not , a regurgitation and memorization school. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop ceige22 Naropa '11 Psychology Studies Apr 16 , 2010 GO Green II A As I said in my previous "Go Green" Naropa is all about providing Transportation alternatives.

They want to make sure that we have a career to support out families. For example , I am a single parent with a part time job. I didn't think I was going to be able to enroll in school this fall. I registered and went to the college just to see if I could find some classes. I knew that I couldnt go full time because I had to pick my daughter up from school and I had other things going on in my life , too. Basicly they had to work around my schedule or I couldnt enroll this semester. To make a long story short , I ended up finding some classes that worked around my schedule. I'm focused on getting my degree in the Healthcare field. National Park Community College is a great place to start your life. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body stormeylane06 National Park '12 Nursing Jul 29 , 2010 Online Courses at National Park Community College A The online courses are very easy to enroll for.

B Personally , I find the tuition to be a little high for the quality of education that I am receiving in some classes. There have been many semesters where I have been curious about financial aid and have been discouraged from looking into it more by the size of the line outside of the financial aid office. I do like how the school has a payment plan that I could use to pay my tuition. If that wasn't an option , I'm not sure that I would have come as far in my education as I have. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 7 Next Last Still Have Questions?

There is a parking ramp that is available about two blocks from school for approximately $350 per semester. This is nice especially for the winter time.

The only thing I wish Northland had would be a French class , but beside that Northland is wonderful. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last Comparable Schools Bates College Bowdoin College Colby College Colorado College side - by - side comparison Bates College Location : Lewiston , ME Tuition : $49 , 350 Room & Board : $0 Student Body Size : 1 , 738 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Bowdoin College Location : Brunswick , ME Tuition : $40 , 020 Room & Board : $10 , 880 Student Body Size : 1 , 771 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school Colby College Location : Waterville , ME Tuition : $50 , 320 Room & Board : $0 Student Body Size : 1 , 838 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Colorado College Location : Colorado Springs , CO Tuition : $37 , 478 Room & Board : $9 , 624 Student Body Size : 1 , 966 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

I learned true competition and saw raw talent at its truest form. I saw attitude and personal relationships between co - workers and friends. I saw the struggle of an artist emotionally , physically , and financially and saw passion at its finest breaking point. The school was a great space for self teaching experiences and when learning about yourself , the best atmosphere is one where people are not telling you what to think or feel. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

My entire experience overall was quite mediocre. You pay well over 3000 per semester and in some classes you LITERALLY sit and do nothing. I.E. Sports , Photo Journalism... too many to count we would go on individual assignments and bring back our work the following week. The instructor would review one slide show of all images , say good or bad , and then everyone would split. The beginning was great I always felt like I was learning something , but after I got into my second and third semester , it became beyond ridiculous. And by no means am I over exaggerating when I say that even the current students enrolled in the BA program for Videography find it a joke! It is a long standing comedy that when you finish at the school you are blacklisted for getting a degree from them and you will be better off working for yourself. Multiple times you will be required to purchase expensive books yet NEVER use them. While there are a FEW instructors who care passionately for what they do , they are FAR and FEW in between. There have been instructors there who ADMIT to not knowing what they are doing. Nossi prides itself on receiving numerous students awards ( a.k.a. Addys ), but you should know , the students who receive these honors have put in some serious independent time to learn the trade away from the school. If you want to get anything for your money at all and decide to go to Nossi anyway , my best advice is to befriend the few knowledgeable instructors and pick their brains , as I did. Otherwise , it will be a great loss to you. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience foto.fabulous Nossi Art '10 Commercial Photography Jul 25 , 2010 Consider somewhere else D+ I graduated Nossi College of Art with an Associate of Occupational Studies in Commercial Digital Photography.

Plus , only one of the houses lets guys who are not of the fraternity house attend these parties while the others restrict them.

Naturally tuition is through the roof. The education I'm receiving is more than worth it. The professors are amazing and i learn something everyday. The security I guess fits the campus. There is curfew 1230 during the week and 230 on weekends. There are two or three people who come around and lock the doors. So for being such a small campus , its as big as security is going to get. Living wise? I feel like I'm paying too much for the living situation. I live in "upper class" dorms , but there is always a problem with them. Our electricity goes out in the bathroom often and my roommate and I cross our fingers for hot water everyday. The cleanliness has come up a little but before it was RIDICULOUS. I felt like I was complaining about something different every other day. I guess alot of it also depends on who the Resident Assistant is.My overall experience of living in the dorms on a scale from 1 - 10 is a 6. And that would only be because of the relationships I've formed from living in them. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Health & Safety rdshockley Oklahoma Wesleyan '13 Psychology & Counseling Jan 05 , 2011 Nightlife B - Well since it's a Christian college not much partying or club scene goes on unless you go off campus.

Be careful though in the winter ( it also gets reallly cold ) when walking around because there are a lot of stairs. Usually they're pretty well salted though.

This concept spans throughout the college , such as its student - to - teacher ratio being so small ( allowing for more one - on - one help when needed ), easier times crossing campus to get to other classes , and easier time making friends around campus , which creates an overall intertwined campus of friendly students. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop koistisr Pacific Lutheran '13 Medicine and Medical Studies Jan 23 , 2011 Pretty Darn Chilly B Being in the Northwest , PLU is usually raining or under clouds majority of the year. When it isn't and there's blue skies , its still moderately windy , making it cold most of the year. But when there is snow , most of the time , classes are cancelled , which is nice for a commuter student , like myself. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Weather koistisr Pacific Lutheran '13 Medicine and Medical Studies Jan 23 , 2011 Strict Within Reason C+ Although I live off campus , I have heard about the types of problems that they must deal with. There are parties off - campus and the such , but campus safety never has had any major problems. Most times , if students are found or their rooms contain alcohol , then they are forced to throw it out and given a warning. After that point they are put on academic probation. Still , the people on campus are friendly to people , and help them if they need to get somewhere or are having problems. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness First Previous Page 1 of 18 Next Last Comparable Schools Reed College Seattle University Western Washington Willamette University side - by - side comparison Reed College Location : Portland , OR Tuition : $39 , 700 Room & Board : $10 , 250 Student Body Size : 1 , 406 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Seattle University Location : Seattle , WA Tuition : $29 , 340 Room & Board : $8 , 805 Student Body Size : 4 , 062 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Western Washington University Location : Bellingham , WA In - State Tuition : $6 , 159 Out - of - State Tuition : $17 , 190 Student Body Size : 12 , 313 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Willamette University Location : Salem , OR Tuition : $37 , 150 Room & Board : $8 , 900 Student Body Size : 1 , 830 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Yes the tool list is expensive but you can buy the majority of the tools at your local Lowe’s or Home Depot which will cut the cost. Only specific tools , like the fluke 87 DMM , nut driver set , and others which you can probably find used online if you don’t want to buy from vendors. Other than that they don’t provide housing , but you can apply to live at the dorms at YVCC which is about 2 miles away.

There are a lot of bars , but as a student that's under 21 , and would not drink at that age , one can't go in them. There is a roller rink , but mostly kids and pot heads go there. Then there's the hookah lounge , but it's more of a 'relax' area instead of hanging out. Best bet to have fun at night is to just stay in the dorms or at a friend's house , watching movies. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Nightlife jenclark813 Pittsburg State '14 Arts Nov 07 , 2010 It's Pretty Good B - I like the fact that it is a fairly small campus , so it is not easy to get lost or confused after your first week or so here.

It's three stories , however I have never been on the third floor so i'm not sure what it consists of. The first floor is pretty much a chill zone with many tables , couches , a bar where several people can get online at a time , and it also includes a food bar downstairs. The second floor consists of the campus bookstore , ticket center , and another food joint. There is also a Commerce Bank and ATM located inside the student center which is very convenient for all students. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Facilities First Previous Page 1 of 6 Next Last Comparable Schools Kansas State University University of Kansas Washburn University Wichita State University side - by - side comparison Kansas State University Location : Manhattan , KS In - State Tuition : $6 , 870 Out - of - State Tuition : $17 , 577 Student Body Size : 16 , 506 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school University of Kansas Location : Lawrence , KS In - State Tuition : $8 , 206 Out - of - State Tuition : $20 , 175 Student Body Size : 18 , 930 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Washburn University Location : Topeka , KS In - State Tuition : $6 , 116 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 766 Student Body Size : 3 , 906 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Wichita State University Location : Wichita , KS In - State Tuition : $5 , 467 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 501 Student Body Size : 8 , 138 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

The teachers were awesome , I was getting straight A's and I really enjoyed what I was learning , I looked forward to school every evening. Then management decided to fire both of our night teachers. Things have not been the same since , in fact they have gone down hill very quickly and don't look like there is any chance the situation will rectify itself anytime soon. In fact , if I could afford it , I would transfer to another school , but go to rn intead of medical assisting. I miss the lab teacher we had , in fact all of us evening students even started a petition , but we were ignored. The new teacher made rude remarks towards her and talks about drugs , alcohol and swindling the school for more money and much much more. The anatomy teacher does not know how to teach , the whole school is complaining , but we are being ignored. She even gets angry if you ask her a question , she makes me feel like I'm stupid or something for having to ask a question. She gets all red faced , sighs and then starts writing stuff on the board like she's teaching a room full of kindergarteners. Not good. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions? Chat with an education advisor live right now!

It's a whole other experience than one would get at other colleges as the sense of female empowerment is what pushes St. Joe to another level. This college is about pushing students to achieve another level of exellence unparalleled at other colleges and universities. The small class sizes and availibility of a consortium with other Greater Hartford area colleges as well as a study abroad opportunity give students an education unlike any other provided by other schools. It's a challenging academic school where you are surrounded by only the most driven , talnted , and smartest women of the future. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience airotivenilam St. Joseph '13 History Jan 13 , 2011 Facilities at Saint Joseph College B There's a wide variety of facilities which are all kept in perfect condition.

I as a student , am enrolled in the CMA program. The courses offered are very hands on and you learn many things. You get to do phlebotomy , injections , CPR and many more fun things. When the program is hands on the students learn more then rather the instructor just talk. These are just some of the hands on classes that San Joaquin Valley College has to offer. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop booya San Joaquin - Rancho Cucamonga '10 Health Care Management Jul 21 , 2010 Unless Your in the RT Program , There Is No Help! F This college is a waste of money.. once you complete your program your supposed to have job placement assistance , HA! What they do is the same thing you can do. Everyday I get emails from someone with links to places to apply. Then when you call to speak to the supervisor , all she does is yell at you and tell you its all your fault. Wait - when you entered the school they told me you set up interviews with employers and have all these wonderful relationships and ways to get us jobs. LIARS! Out several months now and not a single interview through the school , and employers dont even give me an interview because I have no experience ( just so you know , they dont care about your externship ) . If you REALLY want to go to this school , go for Respritory Therapist , those are the only students they actually do help get jobs. Go to Summit in Colton , my friend went there and they are MUCH MORE HELPFUL and KNOWLEDGABLE when it comes to getting you places , and MUCH MORE PROFESSIONAL! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Career Services booya San Joaquin - Rancho Cucamonga '10 Health Care Management Jul 21 , 2010 Little Mexico in Rancho Cucamonga F If you go here at night , you will feel like you just crossed the boarder going south.

In other words , if a class is being offer more than once a term and the one they have you scheduled for conflicts with our personal schedule , or if we prefer the other instructor , the school will attempt to switch us the other class. I have had no difficulty transferring credits , my only problem has been whether or not the former class was equal to what the class I was required to attend. In some instances , the class I was trying to transfer was "higher" than the one they required me to take.

As an animation major , I'd like to be able to freely go in to the studio and work on my personal stuff without worrying about which teacher is in there , or if someone is using one of the five testing rooms.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades cwille01 Shepherd '13 Biology Jan 15 , 2011 Your on Your Own C - From my personal experiences , I have had minimal to no help from the financial aid office. I am struggling to pay for college , am involved on campus , work for the school , and have a 3.46 GPA , yet the school still doesn't offer to help me whatsoever. Tips for getting financial aid at SU are to apply for FAFSA as early as possible , the school relies on it for all awards , and apply to as many scholarships / grants from outside sources as possible. You're more likely to get something from an outside source than from the school. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Scholarships cwille01 Shepherd '13 Biology Jan 15 , 2011 NO! to Living Off - Campus B The campus strictness is pretty fair at SU. The campus police don't do much unless there is a complaint or they happen to catch someone during their rounds. The strictest part of SU is the off - campus policy. Students must live within 60 miles of the school in order to live off - campus. Otherwise , a student living on campus must apply to live off - campus if they have less than 90 credits ( aka , if the student isn't a senior ) . Reasons for wanting to live off - campus that the school doesn't accept : a job , cheaper than on campus housing , eat healthier off - campus. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness cwille01 Shepherd '13 Biology Jan 15 , 2011 More Diverse Than One Can Imagine B+ Shepherd University has such a diverse student population. There is no possible way to come here and only converse with students of the same ethnic / racial background , economic background , political beliefs , religious beliefs , or sexual orientation.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades specimenatale South Florida Comm '11 Computer Science Jan 07 , 2011 SFCC's Financial Aid Department Steal Tuition Money F My credits were not entirely transferred from Broward college. I was forced to repeat a Humanities course , which I already completed , because it wasn't done in "survey format." The extra work load from this course prevented me from obtaining a 4.0 , during my last 15 credit semester , and focusing on my C++ programming course which I happened to also be forced to take in independent study. I highly disapprove of this school and would not ever recommend it to anyone. I don't trust the Financial Aid department here or what they've done with a lot of my grant money. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility specimenatale South Florida Comm '11 Computer Science Jan 07 , 2011 SFCC Is Lacking Love C Have you ever been under the impression that college was a place to expand your mind and chase other opportunities which could enhance your future? If you're enrolled at SFCC , you can toss that idea right out the window! Not only is this school lacking population , staff and resources , but it seems to be used by the students for recreational activity rather than actually learning anything. I see more people standing around and talking about what alcohols they've consumed over the weekend and what's happening on their social network accounts more than I see anyone who is actually studying or discussing degree - related materials. It disgusts me how the staff allows this type of behavior to continue ; however , I'm not shocked that a lot the staff members do much of the same things - sit around and talk to one another rather than do anything work - related. When I mention the staff , I don't mean the professors , because most of the professors are amazing people ; I'm discussing the people who have the job of answering questions and dislike doing so. Several times , the ladies who work behind the Cashier's window have been extremely sarcastic and condescending when I ask simple questions such as "when will I be able to use my pell grant to buy books , " or "what is the date for pell grant return checks?" I've been repeatedly antagonized by one particular woman who wears glasses. This lady likes to give partial answers to questions , in order to bait someone into asking more questions , so she can answer them as if they're stupid and should have already known the answer. Aside from the rude staff , the campus gym is only available during 2 - 3 hour long time windows for 4 - 5 days per week. It seems to be available to the "athletes" for longer , but even most of these students use a local gym which is not located on the campus. These student carry their snooty elitist attitudes into the local Gold's gym. They seem to be unhappy with their mediocre athletic skills and think of representing their alma mater as more of a job than a privilege. I've been in public gyms at the same time as several of the school's baseball players , and I outlast them every workout. They sneer at me , make rude remarks under their breaths , or throw fits when they haven't received the proper amount of female attention to compensate for their failed athletic careers and lack of physical attributes. It doesn't surprise me that a lot of the people in this circa 1998 technology - driven , dust bowl of a town are angry and nonproductive. I honestly don't see how this institution is still in business because the only enjoyable aspect of any experiences one may have at SFCC is interaction with the professors who care about their job and want to see their students succeed by continuing on with their eduction. I hope this institution reaps what it sows. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources homeboy88 South Florida Comm '14 Biology and Biological Sciences Jan 02 , 2011 I Guess Ok B The school seemed a mixture of equal and unequal treatment.

There are plenty of computer labs and tech support people. Alot of times they have gone beyong thier system to assist me with other computer related issues. I beleive that instructors do have access to most audio - visual equipment for class room instruction. The software is current , printing is fantastic. One major complaint is the staff does allow talking on cell phones , talking out loud , in general in the library and this is so distractive and un necessary. But when the library is empty I am wearing my earphones and working on the computer , the staff , which is 60+ feet from me reports that they can hear my headphones from that distance and requests that I turn down the volume. Yet they allow the overt din of verbal communication during the busy times. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Still Have Questions?

Like any town or city there are better and worse parts and how much you are willing to pay for rent will determine the location and the quality of the place you will get. I do not know how much help the school provides for finding them , for the school offers a good amount of on - campus housing , but there are lots of fliers that people put up on announcement boards around campus , as well as just seeing what is around campus and by word of mouth. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Off - Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 13 Next Last Comparable Schools Trinity College University of Connecticut Rhode Island South Carolina side - by - side comparison Trinity College Location : Hartford , CT Tuition : $40 , 840 Room & Board : $10 , 560 Student Body Size : 2 , 162 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of Connecticut Location : Storrs , CT In - State Tuition : $9 , 886 Out - of - State Tuition : $25 , 486 Student Body Size : 16 , 336 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of Rhode Island Location : Kingston , RI In - State Tuition : $9 , 528 Out - of - State Tuition : $26 , 026 Student Body Size : 11 , 915 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school University of South Carolina Location : Columbia , SC In - State Tuition : $9 , 156 Out - of - State Tuition : $23 , 732 Student Body Size : 19 , 168 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

There is hardly any interaction between either of these groups , and neither of them get along with each other often. The curfew rules for freshman is strict , what you do off campus is closely watched , and you constantly have to watch what you say so activities against the schools code of conduct doesn't get back to the administration or your RA. Other students will tell on you if they suspect you're breaking these rules. There are only a few times a week where other sexes are allowed into your dorm , and while they are you have to keep the door open , light on , and both feet on the ground. And in dorms with community bathrooms it is forbidden to use them for showering or restroom use because of the guests in the dorm , which is incredibly inconvenient. The only internet you can connect to in the dorms is the one SNU provides which has strict settings on which sites you're allowed to view. Also , living on campus requires you to have a meal plan , which is not food for your moneys' worth. Unless you are very willing to conform to these rules , SNU isn't a place for you. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 5 Next Last Comparable Schools Duke University Eastern Nazarene College Princeton University University of Washington side - by - side comparison Duke University Location : Durham , NC Tuition : $38 , 741 Room & Board : $11 , 154 Student Body Size : 6 , 550 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school Eastern Nazarene College Location : Quincy , MA Tuition : $22 , 014 Room & Board : $7 , 912 Student Body Size : 823 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Princeton University Location : Princeton , NJ Tuition : $35 , 340 Room & Board : $11 , 680 Student Body Size : 5 , 069 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school University of Washington Location : Seattle , WA In - State Tuition : $7 , 692 Out - of - State Tuition : $24 , 367 Student Body Size : 24 , 325 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades lchooljian Saint Anselm '10 History Jun 12 , 2010 Saint Anselm : a New Englander's Dream A - If you like the changing seasons , and you don't mind a chill for the majority of your education , than Saint Anselm is for you. The beautiful spring weather brings everyone outside , and our campus absolutely shines in warmer weather. The only downfall is the major snowstorms , and with that classes are hardly ever cancelled. I continue to stand by an A - however , because for $42 , 000 per year , too many cancelled classes is a luxury. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Weather lchooljian Saint Anselm '10 History Jun 12 , 2010 If You Love Partying in the Dorms , This Is the Place for You C - Surely one cannot imagine college life without a few dorm parties here or there , but unfortunately Saint Anselm students can imagine dorm parties as the only option every weekend. If you're under 21 , you are left with upper apartment hopping , funneling beers in the bathrooms of Domenic hall , or sitting around in a dorm watching freshman boys play video games. An even more popular option would be traveling up to the "Uppers" uninvited , and congregating outside of the dorms of people you don't know. But again , just like the dorms , senior year seems to make everything worthwhile. Going out to the pub on campus is a blast , ( but then again , who wouldn't enjoy playing trivia and drinking pinot with monks? ), the Manchester bars are really fun , and the uppers are really an enjoyable place to live. But as the days of laying on my twin bed , mikes hard lemonade in hand , and flabbergasted at the lack of activities , a C - must be given. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Nightlife lchooljian Saint Anselm '10 History Jun 12 , 2010 Upperclassmen Apartments Are Great , the Rest...Not So Much B - I would give my school housing a C , as to them , C means average work , but I do believe the upperclassmen townhouses are something special. While students have to suffer through three years of unfair housing lotteries , small and outdated dorms , with the only perk being a sink in the freshman girls dorm ( Oh the wonders of not having to leave the room to brush my teeth ), it is a much deserved spot in the townhouses of the "Uppers" that makes it all worthwhile. All the seniors live together in a neighborhood of sorts , creating great camaraderie and capping off a great four years. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last Comparable Schools Stonehill College UMass New Hampshire Rhode Island side - by - side comparison Stonehill College Location : Easton , MA Tuition : $31 , 210 Room & Board : $12 , 240 Student Body Size : 2 , 420 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of Massachusetts Location : Amherst , MA In - State Tuition : $11 , 917 Out - of - State Tuition : $23 , 414 Student Body Size : 19 , 315 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of New Hampshire Location : Durham , NH In - State Tuition : $12 , 743 Out - of - State Tuition : $26 , 713 Student Body Size : 12 , 035 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school University of Rhode Island Location : Kingston , RI In - State Tuition : $9 , 528 Out - of - State Tuition : $26 , 026 Student Body Size : 11 , 915 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

There is no specific freshman , sophomore , Junior or seniors housing. You can choose to live anywhere in campus. I love how clean the hallways are for the most part. There is also choice of co - ed , roommates , single or town houses. However the prices vary according to which one you choose. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing fitsumethio SUNY at Potsdam '13 Business Administration and Management Dec 15 , 2010 Great Place to Go to School B - SUNY Potsdam is State of New York public college. Its one of the smallest SUNY college with population of about 3 to 4 thousand students. Its located Northeast of New York. Its very cold for most of the year with a lot of snow for most of the year. For education purposes , this is the best place you should consider because its not a big party school. It has all activities you can think of , you name them. It's extremely safe , quite and amazing place to concentrate for school. Its so small that almost everyone knows each other. Potsdam is well know for the hockey and its basketball teams. Almost every student attend most of these events. The stadium is usually packed because every is supporter. The community is amazing , everyone is sociable. If you are considering SUNY colleges , you should take look at Potsdam and see if they offer what you want. Take my word , I don't regret my choice to come here. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Local Atmosphere First Previous Page 1 of 12 Next Last Comparable Schools SUNYIT Stony Brook University University at Albany University at Buffalo side - by - side comparison SUNYIT Location : Utica , NY In - State Tuition : $6 , 090 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 990 Student Body Size : 1 , 547 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Stony Brook University Location : Stony Brook , NY In - State Tuition : $6 , 488 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 388 Student Body Size : 15 , 124 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school University at Albany Location : Albany , NY In - State Tuition : $6 , 748 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 648 Student Body Size : 12 , 338 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University at Buffalo Location : Buffalo , NY In - State Tuition : $4 , 970 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 380 Student Body Size : 17 , 966 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

There are a lot of adjunct professors , meaning they have a carreer and teaching is there side - job , and that leads them to seem distracted and less concerned about your education. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academics kjsamuel Suffolk '14 Radio and Television Broadcasting Technician Jan 17 , 2011 Fair and Balanced B+ A lot of people got scholarships through the school for a ton of reasons , most of them being academic.

They're all really pretty well kept , it basically depends on who gets put where. Since you can only stay in University housing until the end of sophomore year ( unless of course you're an RA ) there's not really an underclassman / upperclassman split. The best one for freshman would have to be Miller Hall since it's close to everything you need your first year ( and since you're going to be stuck with awful 8 AM classes , the closer your classes are , the later you can sleep in ( And living in the city with endless things to do?

I do , however , feel that some professors are races in the fact that many non - white student have difficulties passing classes. The reason for not passing or barely passing is because the teachers say they do not receive the students assignments , yet the students have proof of turning them in. I also feel that if a student is not of a christian faith , being that the school is Christ centered , other students / faculty look down on them. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Diversity bgtrkstar10 Tabor '12 Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Administration Aug 25 , 2010 Communication B+ i cam to tabor to run track and study communication , the campus is great , and the cafe food is amazing. the classes are small , which is great because the teacher and student can interact more. just wish the school had criminal justice as a major her but overall the campus is very welcoming and feels like home. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academics First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last</DIV></DIV>

I was told we were a winning team. My first week at texas College , and everything he said , wasn't true. I forgot to mention the fact that he didn't tel me it was an HBCU , a historically black college or university , not that I'm a racist , but that kind of information shouldn't be withheld. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience ravenashley12 Texas College '09 Mathematics Oct 01 , 2010 Sports Are Average C Sports at Texas College are pretty average.

N / A Around here , there are jobs that require certain qualities that only college students have and they are often needing to be filled. The options around here are pretty vast for such a small town and college. It wouldn't take long for me to find a career if I were to go looking now. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Career Services iReadiWriteiConquer Texas State Tech - Harlingen '13 Web Page and Digital Design Nov 10 , 2010 I Have People N / A You'll find that around here , there are so many instructors with varying backgrounds that to not find the person with all the information you need seems pretty impossible. If I need information on the military , I can walk down over to the MMA station where the Iwo Jima memorial is or speak to the government instructor who also happened to be in the Air Force. The library is pretty well stocked but I loathe the fact that the fiction section is just embarrassingly small. It was a bit like a child thinking they were going to the candy store only to find that they only had one stick of sugar free gum left. It was terrible. But I think the instructors make up for the library's lack. They've got plenty of interesting -- and questionable -- stories for me to hear. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources iReadiWriteiConquer Texas State Tech - Harlingen '13 Web Page and Digital Design Nov 10 , 2010 Sweet!

Pardon me , I actually meant to say that college is wonder and TSTC was the cold drink I needed in the desert that was my education. While I was admittedly surviving my years in high school , I never could fully say I was enjoying myself , but TSTC gives me something to look forward to. The diverse community , the interesting teachers , the disappearance of most of those insane little problems teens seem to have ( okay , with the exclusion of that one talkative girl in my class but we're not going to venture into THAT little enigma today ) . It's just been amazing here and I feel right at home. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 7 Next Last Still Have Questions? Chat with an education advisor live right now!

Every employee is very two - faced and won't help you unless it benefits the Art Institute , a.k.a. THEIR POCKETS. The process is a pain in the butt , but if you fill out your FAFSA correctly with no special exceptions , it should be fairly simple. The quality of education I am receiving , however , is not up to par with what I am paying to attend that school.

The only thing I don't really like is that I have to be paying monthly until I finish school. According to Financial Aid office , both of my parents are making enough money. In reality , they really don't include the bills they both have to pay. My mother works to help my father and when she can , she helps me with a few bucks here and there. But I believe the education I'm receiving is worth the money. Even though it's tough , but it is also worth the tuiton I paying for.

I am not of age to drink , and if I were , I still wouldn't. I feel too many students take part in unhealthy activities. Students are careless , and don't realize the things they are doing aren't safe.

Sometimes , there is nothing good , unless you want to wait in a really long line. This happens mostly around lunch and dinner. The dining hall staff is kind of odd. They aren't always very friendly , and don't seem to like their jobs. The dining hall should be open later on weekends , and preferably everyday. Meals should be abel to be used in the Camelot Room. There should be some sort of food place in Picotte , the one art building that is further downtown. Students should be able to use their meals on others , instead of 5 guest passes a semester.

I wished to be able to connect with other students , but it seems that local commuters tend to stay within our own groups , and international students are doing their own thing. And the numbers of international students are constantly growing , and the local student population is constantly dropping , perhaps it is because international students are more wealthy and have more to offer? 1 2 3 4 5 Report Diversity shandygami New School '11 Animation , Video Graphics and Special Effects Jan 25 , 2011 New School Is Safe Enough A - I have never really seen any crimes during my career here in the New School.

There is a large lunch room where students meet each other and can spent time together. In Triton we have a really good library that help us. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources xxbarbiecouture Triton '12 Business Administration and Management Sep 18 , 2010 Community Feel A Since Triton is a community college , the class sizes are much smaller than that of a traditional college or university. This enhances the students' learning ability because it allows teachers to have more one - on - one time with each student. The fact that it's a community college , you're able to interact and meet all sorts of people varying from age range. The facility is very well kept and always clean. Something cool about Triton is that the school often takes trips worldwide , so there's definately travel opportunities for those who are interested. There's a large variety of programs available and even extracurricular classes to take such as dance or yoga. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop xxbarbiecouture Triton '12 Business Administration and Management Sep 18 , 2010 Private Scholarships C I haven't applied for financial aid so I'm not sure how that whole process at Triton should be ranked. What I do know is that if you recieve any outside scholarships they do go through the financial aid and scholarship office and the Triton process can be a bit of a headache. Both times that I've recieved outside scholarships it takes Triton a couple weeks to process that information. One time , it took so long that all my classes got dropped so I had to go to the counseling center and re - enroll. That was inconvenienet considering they didn't have the same classes or schedules anymore. It's also a hassle to get in contact with certain people from the financial aid office. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last Comparable Schools Wilbur Wright Lincoln land Morton College Northwestern College side - by - side comparison Wilbur Wright Location : Chicago , IL In - State Tuition : $8 , 125 Out - of - State Tuition : $9 , 607 Student Body Size : 4 , 343 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Lincoln Land Community College Location : Springfield , IL In - State Tuition : $5 , 070 Out - of - State Tuition : $7 , 440 Student Body Size : 3 , 264 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Morton College Location : Cicero , IL In - State Tuition : $6 , 676 Out - of - State Tuition : $8 , 724 Student Body Size : 1 , 600 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Northwestern College Location : Chicago , IL Tuition : $19 , 940 Student Body Size : 361 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

Most students make friend with those who live off campus and go to their parties. Both the bar and houses are withing walking distance from campus and the is no public transportation so it's either walking or a car. Under 21 students tend to make their own fun since the town shuts down after 8. Unless student activities has an event , it really comes down to how imaginitive you and your friends are. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Nightlife marinebio Maine at Machias '11 Biological Sciences Jun 28 , 2010 Not Used the Cramped B - The library is almost never used during the smester but right before breaks and finals it can become over crowded. WiFi is great and certain student rooms can pick it up if they are near a hot spot. The only flaw to internet service is the ethernet connections go out too often in student rooms and this is the service the IT department prefers us to use. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Computers marinebio Maine at Machias '11 Biological Sciences Jun 28 , 2010 Small Student to Faculty Ratio B+ What really sold me on going to the University of Maine at Machias was the student to faculty ratio. My largest class has been 25 and the smallest in 12. The usuall average is 16 and this allows for much better interaction with professors. Some of them even provide students with their home phone numbers.

Most of us know about one another's personal lives and sometimes hang out other than studying. A majority of students seem to be African American. There are few scholarships available to non - minority individuals. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body jvg123 Phoenix - Columbia '11 Business Administration and Management Nov 06 , 2010 Business Professional Curriculum A - University of Phoenix offers a wide variety of business degrees. The professors are qualified for what they teach , as most of them work in the field they teach. Academic and financial aid advisors are personable and caring of each student. The workload is heavy but the classes are only five weeks long , therfore in order to learn adequately , this is a must. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience jvg123 Phoenix - Columbia '11 Business Administration and Management Nov 06 , 2010 Not What I Thought B - I enrolled at UoP because I could finish my degree quickly while learning in the classroom - rather than online. I learn better in a classroom environment. I have six classes to graduation and found out they are only available online. Otherwise , I will have to wait eight months to take the classes on campus. This would postpone my August 2011 graduation. The worst part is that my remaining classes are core classes like mgmt and accounting. I think the school does this to obtain more money because online classes are $600 more per class. Their tuition is high : $582 per credit hour online and $374 per credit hour ground. I hope it is worth it. The financial aid advisors are good at UoP. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Still Have Questions?

A - The facilities here are not bad. Gym is opened everyday and is very accessible , even when there's a class going on. The library is a good place to study in , especially on the second floor. Some bad things about the library is that it's not opened 24 hours , and there's no MCAT , OAT , LSAT , etc , practice books in there , though you can find them in the career's office. Plenty of clubs for you to join , ranging from ski club to cultural clubs. Campus set in a peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Nothing to do in town , but that can make you focus more on your academics! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Facilities nickchoy91 Pitt Bradford '13 Psychology Jan 06 , 2011 Nightlife Is Pretty Bad C+ Nightlife in Bradford is pretty bad. The only one place that you can eat offcampus is MCD , and that is not exactly healthy for college students.

D+ The University of South Carolina - Aiken is not a stellar school for public transportation. The only realistic options are to live on campus and walk to school or to drive / carpool. There are technically taxis , and possibly even a bus , but they're very unrealistic options. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Transportation susanet South Carolina - Aiken '14 Mechanical Engineering Dec 07 , 2010 Live and Let Live A - The University of South Carolina - Aiken is very fair about their policies and their methods of enforcement. Students are , for the most part , left alone to do what they will. This is , of course , as long as students stay within the boundaries of the law. The school isn't a party school to begin with , so there aren't even stories about how bad students were busted. People generally follow the rules and are left to do as they please. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness susanet South Carolina - Aiken '14 Mechanical Engineering Dec 07 , 2010 I Don't Club N / A The University of South Carolina - Aiken does not have any nearby nightlife hot spots that I am aware of. A relatively short drive to nearby Augusta provides a wide variety of activities from which to choose. In Aiken , however , there are more family - oriented activities.

There are police officers patrolling the school during the day , but at night , I have never seen any. There is a parking lot which is far away from the main campus , and that place seems fairly dangerous. I know one girl who had a night class and was followed by a homeless man , and it was 7 : 00 p.m. She was very scared. Campus security is very heavy and strict about alcohol and drug enforcement , however. The campus security here is used mostly on enforcing parking tickets. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Health & Safety LeoC92 UT Pan American '14 Psychology Jan 24 , 2011 High School Part II D - Being 10 minutes away from Mexico , there are a lot of students from big cities in Mexico , as well as Mexican - American students. There is not much diversity here at all , and most students are Catholic and base their social and political issues / opinions on that. A lot of students here take their education for granted and only put minimum effort , so having a high GPA is not very hard. I have only seen about 6 Europeans , a group of African - American women , and some Asians in this school. About 80% of the students are Hispanic. There are many gay and lesbian students , but most are closeted due to the high lack of acceptance towards them ( a lot of people say &quot ; That's gay&quot ;) . Basically , this school is known as a commuter school where people only come to finish their basics and then transfer. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Diversity First Previous Page 1 of 32 Next Last Comparable Schools UT Arlington UT Brownsville UT San Antonio University of Virginia side - by - side comparison UT Arlington Location : Arlington , TX In - State Tuition : $8 , 186 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 834 Student Body Size : 14 , 293 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school UT Brownsville Location : Brownsville , TX In - State Tuition : $4 , 872 Out - of - State Tuition : $12 , 074 Student Body Size : 6 , 105 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school UT San Antonio Location : San Antonio , TX In - State Tuition : $6 , 417 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 065 Student Body Size : 19 , 783 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school University of Virginia Location : Charlottesville , VA In - State Tuition : $9 , 872 Out - of - State Tuition : $31 , 872 Student Body Size : 14 , 750 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

That being said , I feel like an outsider amongst the East Texans. The school is pretty nice , but housing , traffic / parking , the gaudy brown buildings , etc. are certainly not the school's shining features.

There never seem to be enough parking spaces and the relatively small streets that run through and around the campus often have students parking on either side. There is a city bus that comes close to the campus , though it's not the most efficient way to get around Tyler.

You have to read in order to learn all there is to know about nursing. Besides the intense amount of reading , you have your occasional papers that are due at the end of the semester. These papers are usually a nursing care plan on one single patient you have had that semester and you plan out everything based on their illness. Other busy work is given throughout the semester and can range from essays to presentations.

I am a hot blooded type of person so I like the heat. The pool is available to all after swim practice. It can be rather relaxing. There are also lots of activities available during this time too. However when winter rolls around it is frigid. Bundle up as much you can. There aren't many activities available but when they are it really highlights the holidays. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Weather CagedBird21 Texas of the Permian Basin '13 Biology Aug 24 , 2010 Heavy Duty C It's a good thing that they are strict but at the same time it can be a little ridiculous. You basically can get pulled over for the most trivial reasons. There is little mercy once a rule is broken. However there is constant patrol and I do feel secure when roaming the campus after hours. There are emergency call button booths on every other corner. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness CagedBird21 Texas of the Permian Basin '13 Biology Aug 24 , 2010 Easy Access and Encouragement A - Sport at University of Texas of the Permian Basin are heavily advertised. Many locals are aware of game days and show up to support their college. We have a great gym and support from professors , students , and faculty alike. People get really into the sports available. I think it's partly because we don't have a football team. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Athletics First Previous Page 1 of 8 Next Last Comparable Schools Texas Christian Texas State - San Marcos Texas Tech University Incarnate Word side - by - side comparison Texas Christian University Location : Fort Worth , TX Tuition : $28 , 298 Room & Board : $9 , 810 Student Body Size : 7 , 326 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Texas State - San Marcos Location : San Marcos , TX In - State Tuition : $6 , 168 Out - of - State Tuition : $12 , 816 Student Body Size : 21 , 221 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Texas Tech University Location : Lubbock , TX In - State Tuition : $6 , 210 Out - of - State Tuition : $12 , 858 Student Body Size : 22 , 061 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Incarnate Word Location : San Antonio , TX Tuition : $21 , 290 Room & Board : $8 , 780 Student Body Size : 3 , 373 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

C+ The dining place on campus...I'm pretty sure no one goes there. Poalos in a pizza place near the "campus" and everyone goes there. Great Pizza. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Dining mfulton The Arts '14 Dance Jan 04 , 2011 City Buses Are Your Best Bet D The only school sponsored transportation is inconvenient and unreliable. On call only after 7pm ( and until about 2am ), the University vans can be called from the front desk of any University building. They will take you anywhere within a certain radius ( not unreasonable ) but will not pick you up from any non - university building. So if you are going somewhere way off campus , the transport service can take you there but not back. Also , the vans are in high demand and therefore unreliable. You may end up waiting an hour or more for the van to come by to pick you up. The best option , I've concluded , is Philadelphia's SEPTA bus system. At $2 / ride , they are always easy to catch within a short walk and there are so many buses that you will never have to wait long at any given bus stop. The subway is also inexpensive , but unlike buses , there is not a regular interval at which trains come by. Once I had to wait 45 minutes for a train. That said , everything essential is within walking distance , I've only taken the bus / train / vans to go to friends houses , see shows , or visit other campuses. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Transportation mfulton The Arts '14 Dance Jan 04 , 2011 No Greek Life on Campus N / A The only options are to join fraternities or sororities at Drexel , UPenn , Temple , or other nearby campuses. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Greek Life First Previous Page 1 of 5 Next Last Comparable Schools Virginia Commonwealth Washington University Weber State University Yale University side - by - side comparison Virginia Commonwealth Location : Richmond , VA In - State Tuition : $7 , 117 Out - of - State Tuition : $20 , 751 Student Body Size : 19 , 150 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Washington University Location : Saint Louis , MO Tuition : $38 , 728 Room & Board : $12 , 465 Student Body Size : 6 , 194 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school Weber State University Location : Ogden , UT In - State Tuition : $4 , 088 Out - of - State Tuition : $11 , 554 Student Body Size : 10 , 570 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Yale University Location : New Haven , CT Tuition : $36 , 500 Room & Board : $11 , 000 Student Body Size : 5 , 250 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Well organized , it's not difficult to get between buildings quickly. The trade - off is less lawn space than I've seen on other campuses. The buildings give a decent "college" feel , but don't necessarily go together aesthetically.

Just renovated this summer , it houses a large selection of cardio and weight machines in a nice atmosphere. The student center , or PSC , is a place that helps to tie the campus community together. There are plenty of dining choices , a large computer lab , a coffee shop , bookstore , and the Pioneer Involvement Center , which is home to all of the campus organizations. There are also regularly scheduled events at the PSC , including open mic nights , and visiting acts , such as comedians. The campus itself is perfectly sized ; at most , it will take you only 10 minutes to walk from your dorms / from one building to an academic building. Everything is spaced rather closely , which makes it a nice walk. Campus has a nice aesthetic : lots of trees , plenty of places to sit and chat...it feels nice and homey. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Facilities First Previous Page 1 of 10 Next Last Comparable Schools Wisconsin - La Crosse Wisconsin - Stevens Point Wisconsin - Whitewater Valparaiso University side - by - side comparison Wisconsin - La Crosse Location : La Crosse , WI In - State Tuition : $7 , 509 Out - of - State Tuition : $15 , 082 Student Body Size : 8 , 321 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Wisconsin - Stevens Point Location : Stevens Point , WI In - State Tuition : $6 , 528 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 101 Student Body Size : 8 , 184 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Wisconsin - Whitewater Location : Whitewater , WI In - State Tuition : $6 , 495 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 068 Student Body Size : 9 , 055 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Valparaiso University Location : Valparaiso , IN Tuition : $28 , 320 Room & Board : $7 , 960 Student Body Size : 2 , 733 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

A+ At the University of Wyoming you will have trouble finding a club that doesn't interest you , and if there isn't starting one is easy. There are clubs for religious views , sports , theatre , dance , video games , majors , minors , music , and hundreds more. There are great shows put on throughout the year by the theatre department , concerts by the music department , and even famous names brought in to view for free or extremely reduced prices. This year the University of Wyoming brought Ron White , Dead Prez and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Last year they had Lewis Black and The Fray. Every Friday night the University puts on a movie a whole month before it is released on DVD. I've seen The Expendables , Prince of Persia , The Sorcerer's Apprentice , The Social Network , and many more for free. The University goes to great lengths to have something going on every weekend so take advantage of it. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop bmaldk Univ. of Wyoming '13 Criminal Justice and Corrections Jan 25 , 2011 Amazing School to Go to A+ The University of Wyoming is an extremely cheap school to attend. I have friends from Florida , Arizona , and California attending due to cost. The surroundings are beautiful , the academic buildings are being remodeled or brand new. There are over one hundred and fifty student organizations to join. The dorms are slightly small and they are strict on coming back drunk , however if you quietly get into your room and don't cause problems you will be fine. Classes are great , however most of them are filled with one hundred and fifty students. There are multiple sports teams here with NCAA Division teams and club sports teams. If you don't like playing you can cheer. If you join The Stampede every game you go to gets you free points that gets you a dollar off for every point you have at the Brown and Gold Store for university apparel. For football the student section gets vulgar but is one of the loudest sections in the Mountain West Conference. I love being a student here and I love being a Cowboy.

'13 Clinical Psychology Nov 08 , 2010 Experience A My experience at CCC&TI has been very great so far. I feel as if the advisor's here are truly interested and concerned about the college student and what they need to be able to graduate. I was invited to join the National Society of Leadership and Success on the campus , and I am also a part of the theatre department , Foothills Performing Arts , on campus as well. Instead of my school being one where the students don't matter and where they just want to get the students out as quickly as possible , my school , especially with my program of study , are interested in helping the student further his or her career , which make me feel like more than just a number or a source of tuition. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience Braie Caldwell & Tech Inst.

A - When you are looking at going to college , you have to do a lot of research since you are investing your time and your money to gain a higher educational experience. For me , I knew that I wanted to go into the Hospitality side of the industry and I tought that with the reputation of Le Cordon Bleu , and how prestige the name is , California School of Culinary Arts was the choice for me. One of the most important deciding factors was the overall reputation of the school. I wanted to go to a very good school that will give me a better education , but I also wanted a school that was going to push me and challenge me , not giving me an ‘easy A’ grade. I wanted to earn my grades. And this school gave me the push. First of all , the professors are simply amazing! They are well qualified individuals that hold a high caliber of professionalism in all situations. Since my major was in Hospitality , I had the chance to do several cooking classes. Chef instructor Zadi was our chef for our culinary classes. His passion for the industry and his unique way of teaching gave us the education that I wanted. We also had the chance to have Mark Newman as our wine instructor. He was probably the best teacher at the school and the fact that he was let go was a bad move on this school. They really lost an amazing asset to the educational experience for the students. The career services department at this school is the BEST! Rebecca Marrs is in charge of this amazing department. Since we are located in the greater Los Angeles area , there is an abundance of jobs available and they have some amazing leads for everyone that goes to this school. You are in the BEST hands possible when you work with everyone in this department. Tell them that Travis from the HRM program said hi when you go in there next! :) Honestly , I am very impressed with this school. The president of the school is actually well involved with the students. Each chairman of each department is always available to talk to. They have some amazing resources and you will be very happy in the end. I have it an A - due to how crazy parking can be. That was annoying for me since I was a night time student in the HRM program. Parking is horrible!! Everything else deserves an A+!!! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience vikeee California Culinary Arts '12 Services Jun 16 , 2010 Computer Network A+ The computer lab is great they have all sorts of culinary related materials.The student portal is very handy and has a lot of useful information 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources vikeee California Culinary Arts '12 Services Jun 16 , 2010 Le Cordon Bleu A+ I enjoy this school very much.

It opened in like 2002 so dont expect so much from it. We dont have a really big greek seen and the campus is really small. It all depends on how you want you college experience to be. I love the campus and even though i probably will transfer i will never regret coming here. The dorms are nice but expensive. There are literally crop fields right next to and behind the campus. As i write this i can see people farming so if you want to be downtown somewhere in the city then go to csula or something. It takes a little while to make friends but it happens. The teachers are nice and very reasonable. Not many food choices tho. The cafe can get really old.

If you are a commuter , you have the responsibility to buy an $84 parking pass for the 3 quarters , unless you do summer school , in which you must buy a 4th parking pass. The price of parking is a bit on the steep side if you ask me , but you will find a parking spot. I have never not found a space , but be careful not to park in a staff space for the ticket is also on the steep side , starting from $50. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Parking gennyb Cal State San Bernardino '13 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Jan 23 , 2011 Food Galor A+ If you are a fast food junky or a sit down person , Cal State is exactly where you want it to be.

It's reserved for administration only. Therefore students have to park in a separate parking deck. The only thing is , is that they chose the furthest parking deck possible from the school ( we are on a hospital campus ) . So , to get to school , you must hike throughout the entire hospital and the partly outside...rain or shine , winter or summer.I'd estimate it at about 1 / 2 mile distance.

The course work is challenging and life is sooo much easier if you work a week ahead in the reading and homework. But don't be suprised to find yourself the only girl in a classroom over - run with testosterone....and there will be plenty of times that the fact that you are female will be forgotten when they are making jokes. If you're sensitive , you may not fair so well , but if you can give as good as you get you'll be JUST fine. The IT program offers you lots of pretty cool software for free ( with Teacher's signature ) and no , it's NOT trial software , it's the real deal. About the only thing you can't get is Office. The teacher's don't really believe in papers , so you'll probably only see one per semester but that doesn't mean that you won't have to write alot in your homework...you just don't have to follow any special writing styles. The Teachers are open and friendly and willing to joke with you and treat you like an equal if you remember to respect them. There's also an IT club that is working to make interships and fresh - outta - college jobs more available. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience Alyha Central Lakes - Brainerd '12 Information Technology Jan 06 , 2011 Foundation Is Your Friend A The Foundation office is the hub of CLC's scholarship world. If you aren't getting enough financial aid outside of what the school or FAFSA offers you , the best thing for you to do is head down to the Foundation Office and see if you qualify for anything there ( And most people qualify , don't worry ) . The other trick is to get in quickly. Once you know you're attending , make the Foundation your FIRST stop after your college app is in and accepted. The bigger scholarships are the first to go so if you wait until the last second there won't be much money left in the Foundation to do you much good.

When my mom retired this year , CMU also set me up with a Pell Grant. My mother immediately called the University my sister is attending and she received a Pell Grant as well. If it wasn't for CMU and their helpfulness , we would have never known about this opportunity for a Pell Grant.

I declined my loans for the first semester , but found out that I would need them in the second , so I went and talked to the financial aid office , and they reinstated my loans on the spot.

However Alcohol is not allowed on campus. I have heard stories of police waiting outside of dorm halls waiting for people to come back from parties. Alcohol is really easy to obtain because there are plenty of liquor stores in town , and buyers for underage students. Weed is probably the easiest drug to obtain besides alcohol. I have only seen a few people drinking on campus , most of the drinking is done at house parties. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Drug Scene MrNemo Chadron State '14 Business Jan 06 , 2011 Limited Fast Food Restaurants C There are only 5 fast food restaurants in Chadron. They are Taco John's , Arby's , McDonalds , Pizza Hut and Subway. McDonalds is open 24 hours a day which is very nice. However everything else closes at 9 or 10. There are also a few local restaurants. Angela's eatery is a good place to get decent Mexican food. There is also a New York Pizzeria , and a Country Kitchen.

B I have taken 3 classes completely online at this point and while I wouldn't say I have hated them , I would definitely not say that I have loved them either. The required "work" as in math problems and answering questions has been easy , but the discussions have nearly caused me my grade. I have been required to spend countless hours in the discussion boards EACH WEEK in every class that I've taken , which accounts to nothing more than busy work. I have learned nothing from them , nor do I remember much of anything from them either. I think the teachers for the online classes ( at least the ones I've had ) need to focus less on making sure we have enough work to do , and more on the fact that we know the material. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Online Courses Charlaann Clark '11 Criminology Dec 23 , 2010 No Scholarships for Me! B+ I feel like the amount I'm paying for my education at this school is well worth it. Not only are the classes teaching me what I need to know , but there are also a lot of extra things available to me as a student that are included with my tuition , like counseling and health services. It has been difficult in the past to get the financial aid office to understand what I'm talking about or need due to language barriers , so that has been a frustration. I have also never received scholarships in my time at Clark , even though I have a 3.5 GPA and am a member of an honor's society.

However , off campus parking , does require a little more finess. In the middle of town , near several Greek houses , and across from the movie theater there is a huge parking lot. A section of the lot is designated for "All night parking" , the rest is "No parking 3am - 6am." Usually it is not to difficult to get a slot in the overnight parking , however , sometimes on Saturday nights..the slots fill up around 11 pm. Last weekend I was visiting a friend for the night , and parked exactly 1 slot past the "All night parking" , and came back the next morning to find a $20 parking ticket sitting on my windshield. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Transportation CUflynn Clarkson U '14 Political Science and Government Jan 25 , 2011 Best Hidden Secret A+ Potsdam NY , and the surrounding Adirondack park offer sights that cannot be seen anywhere else.

I find some of the older students who are outgoing and have been to college for a few years are very welcoming and offer help. I would consider myself one of those , especially since I am now a peer tutor! Most of the students at this college are accepting , I have never heard of any major problems between any students here. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body chancieacres Columbia - Greene '12 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Jan 21 , 2011 Can Easily Transfer B+ One great option we have at CGCC is how easy it is to transfer credits to 4+ year schools! That is very important if you are interested in continuing to an even higher education! The school has now added more online class availability , which makes finishing up courses easier for those individuals who need more time during the day and can't be as tied up going to class. I have utilized some of their online classes and have been very pleased! I wish they offered more when I was taking them , but I am glad they have made a change! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility chancieacres Columbia - Greene '12 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Jan 21 , 2011 One Personable College! B+ So far my experience with my college is good. The Nursing program I am in isn't the typical 100 - 200 student program , it's less than 60 at this point and I like that. It gives me time to get to know everyone and all the teachers on a more personal level and we have a lot more time with the teachers on a 1 : 1 basis for help. You can't say that about most larger schools. It is closer to my home than most college's around my area and I chose it because it had an excellent Nursing program with good ratings and that was important to me! Most of my instructors come with many years experience and excellent attitudes , which is very important as well! If I could do it over I would have known what my major was from the start so it wouldn't have taken me so long to get that graduation date , however I wish I could have found out about my school from the get go because I think I would have had that degree in my hand by now! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Comparable Schools Corning Community College Crouse Hospital Nursing CUNY Borough of Manhattan CUNY Medgar Evers College side - by - side comparison Corning Community College Location : Corning , NY In - State Tuition : $4 , 000 Out - of - State Tuition : $7 , 470 Student Body Size : 2 , 794 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Crouse Hospital Nursing Location : Syracuse , NY In - State Tuition : $8 , 700 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 134 Student Body Size : 119 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school CUNY Borough of Manhattan Location : New York , NY In - State Tuition : $3 , 468 Out - of - State Tuition : $5 , 358 Student Body Size : 14 , 288 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school CUNY Medgar Evers College Location : Brooklyn , NY In - State Tuition : $4 , 902 Out - of - State Tuition : $10 , 262 Student Body Size : 4 , 367 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

The kitchen is small and many don't even think to use it because of how cramped and bare it is. There is no cafeteria and students have to make due with just the vending machines. The library is always kept very nice as are most of the bathrooms and the school as a whole. The standing sets are nice but with so few of them , students are very limited and student films all start to look the same because of the rooms. The halls have too much color on them which makes it awkward for shooting.

This course is designed to help me get through my college years and while doing so , be very successful at what I am here for. Being able to put together a small portfolio and explain to the class where I thought I would be 5 years from now was really exciting. The entire class got to express themselves and we will all expressed that we wanted great success in the end. I have never been in a school or club that cared enough to ask me where I thought I'd be. It also gave me the opportunity to check myself and make sure that I would be where I want to be in five years. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience Reninanewton CC Beaver County '12 Nursing Oct 18 , 2010 My Body in the Student Body of CCBC.

I can not describe them as a particular race , gender , or even describe their religious belief's. This is because when we are all together behind the doors in the classrooms of CCBC , we are all the same.

C - Well , it does not really help that my school hosts some of the people who decided not to try during their high school years. But what sets it apart from other schools? I would say the location. The only real rational appeal to my school is the practicality in terms of the closeness to New York City , Manhatten , Time's Square E.T.C. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop mosqni Concordia Bronx '13 English Aug 18 , 2010 Transportation. B+ The transportation options in the BIG apple are so diverse that it is hard to explain. First , there are about fifty taxi services in the town of my school alone. Second , if you care to take a ten minute walk , you can get almost anywhere in New York City. What I mean , is that there is a train station ten minutes away. That being said , ten minutes of work can get you almost anywhere you want. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Transportation mosqni Concordia Bronx '13 English Aug 18 , 2010 Tolerance and Sensitivity.

Well , my College is like that : I have friends from Romania , from Uzbekistan , from India , from Russia , from Puerto Rico , from Brazil , from Venezuela , from Chile , and from many other countries around the world. What makes this college special , though , is that it completely accepts everyone , regardless of where they are from , or what language they speak , and indoctrinates ALL of them into the same college atmosphere.

You'll have people from all walks of life , all races , religions , ages , and political veiws. This may be difficult if you have strong veiws though. But the diversity of the school makes this a good entrance into the real world. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body RachelBooker Coosa Valley Tech '11 Early Childhood Education Sep 02 , 2010 Get Your Ducks in a Row and Have Reliable Transportation!!! B - I've had a little trouble getting a full workload. With there being four campuses , only three of which offering the program I'm in , it is hard to find courses close enough for me to get to. In order to get a full workload you must be on top of everything. Sometimes a class you need with be two counties away! Without having the money for a car and having to carpool with other members of classes , you'll not always have a ride to classes if they are far off. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience RachelBooker Coosa Valley Tech '11 Early Childhood Education Sep 02 , 2010 Well Worth It!!! A - I really enjoy attending this school. My instructors are friendly , helpful , and very understanding. I've only had a few problems from this school. The only thing I have problems with is getting books at a decent time and for a decent cost. With getting financial aid monies near the middle of the quarter and not having another income , I have to wait to get books til I have the money. You must have very good budgeting skills to stay above the water. Overall , I enjoy this school though. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Still Have Questions? Chat with an education advisor live right now!

Printing on campus is easy and free if you are printing directly from the computers , otherwise you need to pay to use the copy machine. I do not usually use the campus computers but their speed and reliability is generally consistent and good , as well as wireless abilities. I believe that if you didn't have a personal computer you could definitely get by with the on - campus computers but I know that some computers that were for all - student access have been removed so I believe that there could also be a need for more. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

And the school feels like a second home , I will always consider this school my favorite school because everybody is welcoming and helpful. Though I have previously got scholarships here the first time around I came here , but recently coming back it was hard. I think for returning students they can have another scholarship available if they chose to come back here for another degree or different career field choice. The academic programs are awesome and the social scene is great. The facilities have been slowly and recently updated , which makes a huge improvement! You never have to fear for asking for help because someone is always willing to help you. Sometimes someone will see a problem and come to ask if they can help before you ask! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop bruisedpuppet Cowley County '14 Biological Sciences Jun 02 , 2010 Average Students B Everyone was at least civil to each other.

Now , because of recent budget cuts , all prints on campus cost ten cents per page.

Professors are able to provide students with time and actually care about the students. Some profs even host cookouts or breakfasts for their classes at their homes at the beginning and end of semesters. The smaller community also allows students to be able to have a voice among their peers and be involved in activities. As far as academic programs , our Theology and Biblical studies program and professors are very professional. Several professors have published books , textbooks , essays , etc. Our Business program has many connections with the Rochester community which allows for opportunities for internships ( the Mayo Clinic and IBM are pretty notable here ) . The social scene is what you put into it. There are a variety of activities put on by Student Council and Student Development.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades pressresumex Cumberland County '11 Education Jan 23 , 2011 Computer Labs / Library D - The technology at CCC is easily accessible but there are far more students attending CCC than computers available and it becomes extremely difficult to utilize the technology offered once the semester begins. The hours they keep open are average but the ratio between students and computers is outstanding ( a negative connotation is implied ) . 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources pressresumex Cumberland County '11 Education Jan 23 , 2011 Chosing a Community College First C I chose Cumberland County College on the basis of convenience as well as relatively cheap cost in comparison with other local colleges. As a student who had just graduated high school and was strapped for money , I felt the two year school would be my best bet as far as finances and convenience was concerned. It was. Unfortunately , the professors range from extremely excellent to extremely poor. This range of professionalism and qualification is distressing. The advisors at this college are not familiar with current college standards / transfer requirements and make things more complicated than necessary. I in fact arranged most of my college career myself due to their blatant ignorance of the college's standards , as well as other local four year schools. For the money and convenience , I'm glad I attended this college. I had a number of professors who pushed me farther than I ever thought I could go ( comprehension / retention wise ), and for that I am grateful. However , one must note that transferring from a community college to a four year school has many disadvantages due to the lack of communication between colleges and colleges to individuals. Many four year schools don't quite have their act together as far as transfer individuals are concerned either. This lack of communication and misconception causes much distress for the student in question. If I could do it over again , I would've done it the same way. Take my opinion with a grain of salt as I value education and strive to achieve excellence regardless of how well this college or it's professors did or didn't teach me. I'm an independent researcher anyway , therefore my well rounded education is not due to soley this college and my writing and general means of speaking may decieve you. Yes , Community college is good for the money. But , they are all about the money as well. If you are looking for an extremely good education , I'd recommend revising your resume or making a good resume for yourself and accomplish admittance to a four year school with prestige in their scholarly honors programs. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility walle328 Cumberland County '12 Computer Science Jul 25 , 2010 Simple Registration Process A+ Class registration is simple and can be done completely online. They offer some classes online as well so you can fit them into a flexible schedule. The downside is the school requires a "college success seminar" in your first semester which is available in two formats , 3 credits and 1 credit but does not count towards any degree. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Still Have Questions?

Though there aren't a lot of frats and sororities everyone in greek life is very active on campus so they're all well known and it defiantly boosts the social scene , but greek life isn't for everyone and those who don't choose greek life still have things to do at night and on weekend and have a great social scene. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop TL90 Washington College '13 Sociology Jan 24 , 2011 Somewhat Strict but Easy to Get Around. C When it comes to nightlife , public safety will bust any party if they can hear the music from outside or see alcohol in common rooms. As far as academics , each professor has their own different requirements. Greek life has the hardest policies in all aspects since the new president began. Alcohol policies have gotten significantly more sever. GPA requirement to join greek life have risen and if they drop below the requirement there are repercussions. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness TL90 Washington College '13 Sociology Jan 24 , 2011 Depends on the Sports Team B+ Each team has its own positive and negative points.

B The computer labs are always locked when there are no teachers in the room. In the library there are a few tables of computers , but these tables are always full. Any copies made or pages printed in the library cost ten cents a page if they are single sided 8x11 sheets of paper. From Monday to Thursday the network is fairly reliable , however on Friday most of time I do not know if I will get a signal or not. I find it easiest to simply bring my own computer and wait to print anything until I am back at home. This saves me time , money , and frustration. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources playing4anaudienceof1 Weatherford '14 Accounting Nov 23 , 2010 Way Harder! C - I have only taken one online course , but I have found the schedule to be much more harsh then any face - to - face class that I have taken. The professor for this class tends to be very unforgiving and does not like to work with students who have lives and jobs outside of doing her class. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Online Courses playing4anaudienceof1 Weatherford '14 Accounting Nov 23 , 2010 Some Teachers Great , Others Not. B+ I wish that not all of the teachers were overwhelmed. I have enjoyed my classes with teachers who have smaller teacher to student ratio classes. These teachers are usually able to help the students in their classes better. The teachers that seem to be overloaded risk being viewed as uncaring and too busy to notice anything. My major complaint is that if WC wants to expand and have more students per class then they need to develop more parking lots and a better shuttling system before they expand classes. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Comparable Schools Northeastern Junior Northwestern Connecticut Palo Alto College Panola College side - by - side comparison Northeastern Junior College Location : Sterling , CO In - State Tuition : $2 , 667 Out - of - State Tuition : $8 , 109 Student Body Size : 967 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Northwestern Connecticut Location : Winsted , CT In - State Tuition : $3 , 200 Out - of - State Tuition : $9 , 560 Student Body Size : 600 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Palo Alto College Location : San Antonio , TX In - State Tuition : $2 , 762 Out - of - State Tuition : $5 , 150 Student Body Size : 2 , 724 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Panola College Location : Carthage , TX In - State Tuition : $2 , 088 Out - of - State Tuition : $2 , 712 Student Body Size : 1 , 020 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

If I don't want classes before 8am , I don't have to take early classes. I have work , so night or online classes are a great option as well. Science labs are offered twice. One in the afternoon and one in the evening. If I don't make it to the afternoon lab , I can email my instructor and show up for the evening class. The only problem I have had is my art teacher changing the lab schedule several times in a semester to fit her whims. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility katelyn_w09 Western Texas '13 Arts Mar 23 , 2010 WTC Is a Unique Experience A - I love my school.

The school is little but offers so many different opportunities. The campus is very diverse and I have met so many people from different countries opening my eyes to new ideas and cultures. The academics are challanging but the professors are always willing to work with you and class sizes are small so it's easy to participate in class. The people I have met are amazing and in such a short time I have come to love them dearly. Best of all I get to play soccer , my passion for the sport has carried me to college level which I never thought possible.

When it gets close to the start time of classes , parking can be hectic and bad depending on what building you have to take your classes in but there is always somewhere to park. The security guards and state police help guide parking and it you have to park your car all the way across campus , there aren't any real worries about getting to your car safe because the security guards drive around campus to monitor the activities going on. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Parking IdaMssuccessful Wilmington U '13 Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Administration Jan 08 , 2011 Students from All Different Races and Ethnicity A+ There all are different types of students at at Wilmington University.

There is also apartments that the school provides for $11 , 000 a year. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Off - Campus Housing diaza Woodbury '14 Business Management Dec 14 , 2010 Very Understanding A+ Woodbury University is overall great because all majors have professors that are willing to work with students outside and during class. If the school does not have the specific major that the student wants , the student is able to create their own. All they need to do is find a professor that will be willing to work with that students and in addition , the student also needs to find at least five other students that want to take that class as well.

The one complaint I might have is that the lighting is less than perfect , and the elevator is painfully slow. Other dorms provide very nice homes without being extravagant , which include 36th Street and Schottenstein Dorms. However , Brookdale Residence Hall , where you are required to live your first year on campus , is in major need of renovation ; it is compensated for by its premiere location on 34th Street. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing shoshbalk Yeshiva '11 Psychology Studies Jun 15 , 2010 Dining at Stern B There are two primary cafeterias at Stern College for Women.

My college gives a few scholarships that are simple to apply for , as well as the community offers many that are easy to qualify for. There is a registration fee that is nonrefundable but I am positive that no one has been turned down from Zane State.

Tuition is already expensive , so spending more money for books or supplies is something concern myself and every student. The staff at the financial aid office is always there to support and help us , but they know they cannot do much. It means they cannot reduce our tuition or give us extra money to pay for "other related - expenses." It's extremely difficult for students get money to pay for everything , so they need to work overtime - or have two - three jobs - to get the resources for their education.

The teachers are great , but the administration sucks. The prgram is only 7 months and nt enough is taught in the classroom or lab to be able to go work in the medical field. After the completion of the class time it takes them forever to send you on an extern site.

If you do not take advantage of what is offered at ehe moment , you have nothing left but to regret what you failed to take advantage of. The small campus limits resources and takes great risks out of yourself for a chance at fun.

The help from my financial aid office has been rather helpful but not the right amount of help for me to finish another semester without lacking the right financial aid. If their were a way i could help fellow students and incoming students , i would love for the financial aid office to take more time in the interest and help offer the students different options. Showing opening aid and available scholarships that are being offered in the world would help the student get alittle more help for obtaining a satisfied degree. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Tuition & Financial Aid First Previous Page 1 of 3 Next Last Still Have Questions?

I Have been inside of some of the dorm rooms as well and they are very nicely set up for students. Likewise the sampus even has a curfew time of 10 : 30 pm during the week and 12 : 00 am on the weekends which i find to be very good to help prevent parties and irresponsible behavior. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop TammyGlenn Eastern Arizona '13 Registered Nursing ( RN ) Jan 25 , 2011 Eac A Eastern Arizona College student body I have found to be for the most part very friendly and diverse in ethnicity. Even when we start out a new semester and no one in a class knows one another , within a few weeks one can find us all talking to one another before and after class ( sometimes during as well ) .

The online portion ranges from assignments and disscussions on blackboard , which tends to be tempermental , to extra but graded study with the online version of the text book. I had thought my Psycology class was a regular class but it turned out to be an independet study. The professer was avialiable in his office or via email if we really needed to ask questions , but I had only ever even seen him a hand full of times. We were to study on our own with the text book and some online study tools that came with it , answer a weekly criticle thinking question sent by the professer , and keep up on the tests , which were computerised but taken in the computer lab at school. There was at least one test per week , and a lot of reading to cover. Getting behind was difficult to recover from.

While it can be reached more quickly by driving , there is rarely parking after 8 : 30. My professors have been great as educators , but they rarely warn students in advance when they will be absent. Blackboard is prone to breaking , or getting matinence during the quarter , and many clases are hybrid and require regular use of it. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 13 Next Last Comparable Schools Green River Seattle - Central Shoreline Tacoma Community College side - by - side comparison Green River Community College Location : Auburn , WA In - State Tuition : $3 , 021 Out - of - State Tuition : $8 , 652 Student Body Size : 5 , 151 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Seattle - Central Location : Seattle , WA In - State Tuition : $2 , 773 Out - of - State Tuition : $8 , 199 Student Body Size : 4 , 136 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Shoreline Community College Location : Shoreline , WA In - State Tuition : $2 , 873 Out - of - State Tuition : $5 , 516 Student Body Size : 3 , 488 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Tacoma Community College Location : Tacoma , WA In - State Tuition : $2 , 827 Out - of - State Tuition : $8 , 011 Student Body Size : 3 , 437 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

I just think that it is a shame that you can't hire proffesional willing to give their time into teaching students the correct way! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience lovelylia22 Everest - Skokie '10 Medical Assisting Oct 05 , 2010 Skokie Everest Review C - Well , When I first applied for this school , My advisor was very friendly I guess only to the point to get me in and then once I was in she completly forgot about me , never asked me how I was doing , or did any follow up. I have friends in my class that their advisors always come to see how they are doing! I also feel like everyones curriculum in not the same therefore everyone is not going to get the education they need! As a school that is meant to be hands on we never have any lab equipment on hand for everyday use! In fact we were cut down on that and have a certain number obtained for each classroom for a month! With 25 students that does not go very far! The only thing I can truly say that I like about this school is that the hours in the evenings helped me accomplish my goal of becoming a medical assistant. Also my Teacher is a great person and has helped me out a lot. I wouldn't choose this school again because I feel they are only concerned with Money and they are not concered about the students and who they actually have going out into the medical field. There are students who are very immature , ghetto , and unprofessional beyond belief but they are allowed to pass and continue to go out into the field , clueless of what the real life is like. I would never let any of these people work on me if I saw them come into my doctors office the way they come into school! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 1 Next Last Still Have Questions?

Wouldn't you want an educational institution to care about your safety and welfare. The security guards are very helpful and kind. The major rules to follow : Wear your ID , Attend Class. There are others , but that is what comes to mind. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Strictness EstherJosephNoel_ND7 Everglades '11 Alternative Medicine Jan 24 , 2011 Absolutely Amazing A+ The faculty at Everglades University are very kind and understanding. As long as you communicate and do your work as requested , there should not be a reason for failing. The curriculum is really in - depth. I am enrolled in the Alternative Medicine program and I have really utilized what I have learned from these classes to change the aspects of my life and the life of my family members. Registration was a breeze. I had the most interesting Admissions Counselor. As for the workload , it depends on the course. If you are not a fan of science , then save up for a private tutor. If you really want to learn about alternative medicine , brace yourself to make some unwilling life changes. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academics EstherJosephNoel_ND7 Everglades '11 Alternative Medicine Jan 24 , 2011 People from All Over A+ At Everglades University , you will feel welcomed into a family with many different backgrounds.

However , whenever I’ve gone to a teacher with a specific question , she’s been more than happy to sit down with me. The major complaint I have about the school is that the class registration process is a hassle. It’s all done online , but the system is super slow and I’ve been closed out of classes I really need 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience ThePoptartist Ex - Pression for Digital Arts '12 Apr 08 , 2010 Classes Make It Hard to Find Part Time Work... C Classes can start and end at any hour of the day. So far my craziest class has started at 4pm and ended at 12am. Many classes start at 12am and don't end til 4am or later. You will not find a school with a crazier class schedule. This is mostly due to the lack of classroom space , so the school utilizes every classroom to the max. The school also sets up students for working in the industry , because these hours are realistic when working in this field. This also creates frustrations when working in part time work , for not only are classes at extremely random times , but your term schedule changes every five weeks. This has caused hardship for students trying to find part time work. As far as credits go , Ex'pression transfers any general education classes a student has taken prior to attending Ex'pression if taken at a community college. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility ThePoptartist Ex - Pression for Digital Arts '12 Apr 08 , 2010 Fun for All! A - Ex'pression allows you to graduate in 2 1 / 2 years when any other school would make you graduate in 4 years. The school is accredited and is designed with the students in mind. No other school allows you to shoot music videos for real bands , or make documentaries with motion graphics and student - made music. Signed bands come to Ex'pression for private concerts as well. There are these little perks and more that make Ex'pression stand out from the rest. The school is open 24 / 7 to allow students to come in at all parts of the day to work on their projects , whether they be for school or personal. The campus is pretty small , but is utilized to the max. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Comparable Schools Academy of Art University side - by - side comparison Academy of Art University Location : San Francisco , CA Tuition : $18 , 050 Room & Board : $13 , 400 Student Body Size : 6 , 557 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

The Creative Writing Program is headed by many talented individuals and is one of the best that I have seen. Clubs and organizations are always out and about with events that draw in crowds of students and non - students. The WAMFEST in the Spring draws in many spectators as well - known musicians and writers of all kinds hold a performance for the people of the community. The only downside is the fact that once the students graduate , the students who step up are not as well versed in bringing life to the campus. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop First Previous Page 1 of 6 Next Last Comparable Schools Pace University Rice University Rider University Rutgers University side - by - side comparison Pace University Location : New York , NY Tuition : $32 , 816 Room & Board : $11 , 560 Student Body Size : 6 , 618 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Rice University Location : Houston , TX Tuition : $32 , 057 Room & Board : $11 , 230 Student Body Size : 3 , 317 Admission Difficulty : Very Hard register to connect with this school Rider University Location : Lawrenceville , NJ Tuition : $29 , 060 Room & Board : $10 , 720 Student Body Size : 4 , 074 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Rutgers University Location : New Brunswick , NJ In - State Tuition : $11 , 886 Out - of - State Tuition : $23 , 058 Student Body Size : 27 , 588 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

The major complaint I have about the school is that the class registration process is a hassle.

The high school has a quaint library and multiple computer labs however , college students are not allowed to use theses amenities 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Resources keysgirl21 Florida Keys '13 Nursing Dec 27 , 2010 Just Okay C - I am very happy with the administrative staff at FKCC. They will bend over backwards to help you. However , the teaching staff is very iffy... Most professors are out the door before the students while only a handful will actually stick around and answer any questions you may have. I fully understand that this is college in the keys but honestly these people need to get a grip on reality. For example , my first day of class one of my professors was over thirty minutes late because she forgot that she had class ; this continued almost weekly for the entire semester. Overall I am pretty displeased with the school but the administrative staff is a plus. I just can't wait to graduate this semester. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience Solong Florida Keys '11 English Apr 05 , 2010 Love It A The classes are generally small , which means that the professors are very involved.

Georgia College's police force is very strict about alcohol and drugs but the C.A.s are more lenient. If it is late at night and you are making too much noise , they will come to your door and give you a warning before they contact the police. As long as you cooperate with the C.A.s they will never try to get you in trouble but they will contact the police if they feel you are a danger to yourself or others. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Health & Safety First Previous Page 1 of 21 Next Last Comparable Schools Georgia Tech Kennesaw State University North Georgia & State University of Georgia side - by - side comparison Georgia Tech Location : Atlanta , GA In - State Tuition : $7 , 506 Out - of - State Tuition : $25 , 716 Student Body Size : 12 , 422 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Kennesaw State University Location : Kennesaw , GA In - State Tuition : $4 , 044 Out - of - State Tuition : $12 , 736 Student Body Size : 15 , 497 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school North Georgia & State Location : Dahlonega , GA In - State Tuition : $5 , 036 Out - of - State Tuition : $16 , 650 Student Body Size : 4 , 112 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school University of Georgia Location : Athens , GA In - State Tuition : $7 , 530 Out - of - State Tuition : $25 , 740 Student Body Size : 24 , 673 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades rinx3 Gloucester County '12 Biology and Biological Sciences Jan 06 , 2011 Helpful but Not B+ I have not yet graduated but there is the Career Center that will help me when the time comes. Many of my friends , who graduated from GCC have all told me that the counselors were helpful. But unfortunately , many had to find a job on their own because GCC was too busy attending the others. For now , I am only focusing on my education , but I will still further my studies at Rowan. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Career Services rinx3 Gloucester County '12 Biology and Biological Sciences Jan 06 , 2011 Embarking in the Same Journey A My favorite experience so far at GCC was when I enrolled in the FAll of 2010. The faculty explained to me the necessary items I needed and what I needed to consider in the future. They were friendly despite the long hours they have worked helping the hundred others , during that week alone. I was able to meet my counselor , whose welcoming smile assured me that my first semester would run smoothly , if I kept my priorities straight. I still remember , sitting alongside my mother , the computers , the desks , the people with the same confused looks. These faces and items are imprinted in my mind still because that very day we all embarked on the same journey. We were taking the first step to our education. We all wanted the same thing : knowledge. And GCC is providing us with the studies necessary to make a difference in our lives and for that , I would like to thank them. Thanks GCC. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience rinx3 Gloucester County '12 Biology and Biological Sciences Jan 06 , 2011 Place of Acceptance , Not Fear A From past accounts of the terrifying college experience , GCC proved to all that it is a place of acceptance and not fear. Many have disregarded GCC as a "real" college because it is a community college , but it is not the "13th grade" , like so many have nicknamed it. It is far more challenging and welcoming than those who gave it a bad name. The faculty and students are friendly and are eager to learn. The faculty helps everyone and guides them towards a solution , without the attitude or delays. The alumni is focused on the education and they very from age. A single mother and a 18 - year - old both share the same college experience and can strive to achieve the same results. The professors aid those who do no comprehend the material , despite the different ages and conditions. One professor , Dr. Connley , has made an amazing impact on my life and everytime I think of society , I think of the interesting concepts she taught me. And for that , I am eternally grateful. Overall , GCC has and will always be an open , welcoming and diverse college that will never shut out any. GCC is full of different individuals , that each bring their ideas and stories , but they all share the same mindset : they want to learn. GCC welcomes these individuals and what more can you ask from a college? 1 2 3 4 5 Report Student Body First Previous Page 1 of 5 Next Last Comparable Schools Camden County College Jamestown CC Nassau Community College Pre William Sound side - by - side comparison Camden County College Location : Blackwood , NJ Tuition : $3 , 720 Student Body Size : 8 , 544 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Jamestown Community College Location : Jamestown , NY In - State Tuition : $4 , 140 Out - of - State Tuition : $7 , 780 Student Body Size : 2 , 807 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Nassau Community College Location : Garden City , NY In - State Tuition : $3 , 927 Out - of - State Tuition : $7 , 549 Student Body Size : 14 , 347 Admission Difficulty : Not Available register to connect with this school Pre William Sound Location : Valdez , AK Tuition : $4 , 300 Room & Board : $5 , 000 Student Body Size : 93 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Still Have Questions?

Totally online. It was much , MUCH harder than I expected , but I made excellent grades and have registered for my next semester. In comparing my workload with that of friends in classroom settings , there is an enormous difference. My English 101 class had 6 big essays , weekly discussion posts that were the equivalent of small essays and twice weekly journal entries. One of my friends had only two essays in his class the entire semester. But if you are committed to getting your education and only able to take it online , you can make good grades. My professors were very willing to go the extra step to help me succeed and that was the thing I most appreciated this year. I would recommend Greenville Tech and it's online college to any serious student. The one drawback was that it seems as if any student who registered was allowed into classes and many of them were extremely under - or unqualified to even be in these classes. You expect a certain level of education and intellect of your fellow students and I found that was sadly lacking. Also , once the financial aid was disbursed , many of my fellow students disappeared , as many as half , in some classes. Seems like they were merely trying to get the aid and then just disappear. There should be programs in place to prevent this , as it clogged the system badly. My own very needed financial aid was disbursed eleven weeks into the semester , which is ridiculous. I couldn't even get book vouchers for my books , but had to pay for them by myself. I hope for better things this semester. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience First Previous Page 1 of 11 Next Last Comparable Schools Johnson & Wales...

Unfortunately , it's location of Conway , AR doesn't do much justice for the college. Conway always seems to be overly crowded with traffic at certain times of the day from people leaving to go to Little Rock or coming back from Little Rock , and there isn't much to do in Conway nor many attractions. Fortunately though , Hendrix is such a fun campus with lots of organizations creating events that you don't have to leave campus often to have fun. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Local Atmosphere drongowskiae Hendrix '14 Psychology Jan 24 , 2011 Conway Weather A Like any Southern city , Conway is pretty hot into early - mid September , has a beautiful autumn that runs into early December. When it gets cold down here , it gets pretty cold but not for an extended period of time. Luckily , everything is really close together on campus so walking to classes isn't too brutal. I know Hendrix has given snow days in the past , but really it just seems to be cold and sometimes rainy in the winters.

We studied grammar , sentences , spelling and punctuations but not making an essay or reading an essay. When I moved here in America and I decided to go back to school I found out that Writing and Research is one of the requirements. I enrolled in the class in which I have no idea what it is all about. In this class we studied essay and the purpose of the writer and how to make an essay. My professor explained very well what an essay is and how important it is in college curriculum. As part of the course outline we have to read and understand an essay , in addition we also have to make an essay. I have learned that there are different kinds of essay. There are simple essay , persuasive or argumentative essay and comparative essay. The first essay I wrote which I entitled &quot ; At The Lighthouse&quot ;, was based on my tremendous adventure in an old Lighthouse at Port Washington , Wisconsin.

Filter : All Sections Overall Experience    Most Recent Most Popular Highest Grades Billiam44 Hickey '07 Network , Database , and System Administration Nov 15 , 2010 Easy Classes , Low Amount of Credit Hours C - The professors were generally knowledgeable in their field but not necessarily very experienced with it in the real world. Classes were overly easy in many situations. You don't get to choose or schedule your classes , you are put in to a group of students and follow them throughout your time there. Low amount of credit hours per class makes them hard to transfer to other colleges. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Experience Billiam44 Hickey '07 Network , Database , and System Administration Nov 15 , 2010 Expensive , Credits Hard to Transfer C - I went to Hickey College and graduated in 2007 with an Associate degree in their Computer Network Management program. The teachers were nice , helpful , and had a good general knowledge of the classes that they teach , however throughout my time in college there they claimed multiple times that they would do all that they can to help you get your credits to transfer to another college once you graduate since they don't offer any higher computer degrees. Upon graduating and trying to transfer my credits to go to Kaplan University to get my bachelor’s degree , I found that many of the core classes would not transfer because they were not worth enough credit hours. Upon contacting Hickey College as they had told me to do for help in this situation , I spoke to two different people who said they would get back to me with more information to try and help in a couple of days and they never did contact me back. Upon calling them back they told me there was nothing that they could do and they offered to give me more information on their bachelor's in business management. From my experience with this college I have to say that if you want a computer related degree , it's not really worth it to go to Hickey College. I would find a college that offers further computer degrees so you can be sure that you don't have to re - take a bunch of classes like I have to do. I have spoken with several classmates of mine from Hickey and the ones that are trying to further their education with a Bachelor’s degree are running in to the same issues as described above but with other colleges / universities. If you want a suggestion on where else you can look , Missouri Tech in St. Charles is a technical school that several of my friends have gone to and they say it is very good. If you are looking for an online college you could look in to Kaplan University , I know I am enjoying their classes so far. Thank you for taking the time to read my review , I hope that someone finds this information to be helpful while they are trying to find a good college to go to in the St. Louis area to get a computer degree. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience bbaitman Hickey '11 Business Mar 19 , 2010 Professional Work / School Environment A - Before attending Hickey College I attended a community college and didn't like it at all. The classes were around 20 to 30 people and a lot of them were slackers. I decided that if I was going to go to school and pay for it I want my money's worth out of it!

The classes are challenging and small , so you can't just scoot by unoticed by the professor or cheat. Also , it's a conservative school , but not everyone thinks the same way or believes the same things. Its so refreshing to be at a college where I am part of the conservative majority , not the conservative minority. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Inside Scoop andiemac Hillsdale '14 Biology Jan 04 , 2011 Not Noticable A I don't know anyone who does drugs and I have yet to see someone who even looks like they do drugs. It's a pretty small campus , so I probably would've seen them by now. At the begining of the fall semester , the administrators said that there had been 15 cases of pot possesion and all 15 students had been expelled. There is a zero - tolerence policy on drugs. Alcohol on the other hand is dealt with on a case to case basis , but only if it turns out to be a problem. Campus security and dorm mothers will come to parties to pick up even underage drinkers without any questions asked. Only half of the student body drinks. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Drug Scene andiemac Hillsdale '14 Biology Jan 04 , 2011 Close - Knit A - The Greek life on campus is very active in the community and world - wide. Everyone in the Greek system is viewed in the typical way , but they are not all like the usual wild and loose Greeks. Each house does have a party animal element to it , but there are also plenty of people in the system who are not that way. The Greeks are viewed by the non - Greeks as the usual exclusive prepsters , but it all depends on which side of the bridge you are on. There are 3 sororities and 4 fraternities. Only 1 frat is house - less , but all the other houses are very nice. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Greek Life First Previous Page 1 of 4 Next Last Comparable Schools Hope College Pepperdine University Samford University Sewanee side - by - side comparison Hope College Location : Holland , MI Tuition : $25 , 660 Room & Board : $7 , 870 Student Body Size : 3 , 114 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Pepperdine University Location : Malibu , CA Tuition : $37 , 850 Room & Board : $10 , 900 Student Body Size : 3 , 050 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Samford University Location : Birmingham , AL Tuition : $20 , 420 Room & Board : $6 , 624 Student Body Size : 2 , 702 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school Sewanee Location : Sewanee , TN Tuition : $34 , 172 Room & Board : $9 , 760 Student Body Size : 1 , 465 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

A - Houston Baptist is a great place. You get to meet plenty of people and they are all nice. The great thing about this school is that you have room to be a visionary. If you want to start a new school club or program , all you have to do is be committed and stick with it. There are plenty of people to hang out with , but most stick with who they know or what they know. You have to stay in the books if you want to stay on top , but it's the place I want to be. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience missdanielle Houston Baptist '13 International Business Dec 31 , 2010 Brand New Faces C+ There are many international students , we've got some blacks and hispanics here and there , and we have plenty of white , but it perturbs me to discover how many students live down the street and around the corner or cme from families with a substantial amount of money. I usually see two types of students classified four ways. The wealthy student who can afford this school and goes because it's close and unintimidating , and the wealthy student who comes because they desire to be apart of this school's milestone. Then we have the student who has pulled out a several thousand dollar loan to be here and still decides to leave , and the the student who spends their last dollar , pulls a loan , works , and sticks it out until they graduate. Our retention rate is poor. Half of my incoming class left by second semester and more are slipping through the cracks.

The only apartment complex that I know of that offers a discount for students is chester heights. Although that apartment is close to campus it would be nice if the younger students had more options. I know that IUE is trying to become more than just a small community college. They now offer a sport programs and if they are trying to go in that direction they need to provide some sort of housing. I know there are talks in regards to the old hospital in town that is close to the campus being converted into dorm rooms for IUE students. I think this would be a great idea and a good thing for IUE. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Off - Campus Housing wolfsa2 Indiana - East '11 Biology Sep 06 , 2010 Peer Pressure A This is my first semester here at IUE , and have not had to deal with any peer pressure or any drug scene for that matter 1 2 3 4 5 Report Drug Scene wolfsa2 Indiana - East '11 Biology Sep 06 , 2010 Facilities B+ Classrooms can be tiny at times and feel very cramped.

As opposed to dorm life they are more of an appartment style were each student pays for either a private bedroom or shared with a common room complete with appliances and bathrooms so you dont have to go to the laundry room to cook like at other colleges. Each room also comes equipped with internet lan and wireless cable and a phone line if you desire for local calls. The college is across the street from housing which can be crossed by using a walkway spanning the street. The only problem is that there is no actual cafeteria on campus but there are restraunts in some buildings and there are busses to shuttle you to other places in the city to get food. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 19 Next Last Comparable Schools Kean University Marshall University Murray State University Purdue Calumet side - by - side comparison Kean University Location : Union , NJ In - State Tuition : $9 , 446 Out - of - State Tuition : $14 , 081 Student Body Size : 9 , 232 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Marshall University Location : Huntington , WV In - State Tuition : $5 , 385 Out - of - State Tuition : $12 , 996 Student Body Size : 8 , 043 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school Murray State University Location : Murray , KY In - State Tuition : $5 , 976 Out - of - State Tuition : $16 , 236 Student Body Size : 6 , 826 Admission Difficulty : Very Easy register to connect with this school Purdue University - Calumet Location : Hammond , IN In - State Tuition : $5 , 887 Out - of - State Tuition : $13 , 174 Student Body Size : 5 , 858 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>

A lot of the student body take on leadership positions and work in those areas even on the weekends in ensure that plans go smoothly for the events. The students on campus are mostly asian , and many prefer to study at the library or the newly build tech center , or go off - campus for milk tea / boba and study some more there. There are plenty of opportunities to make friends on campus but because of the great transfer programs to Cal States and Universities , a lot of students prefer to take as many classes as possible to finish their workload sooner , and in turn transfer sooner to their school of choice. Friendships are mostly made through classes you take with the same people , or you happen to join a club for a semester and take the time to attend the socials. There isn't much political activity on campus. We did have a republican club awhile back , but that's been on hiatus for awhile. Our Christina club still does prayer meetings in the mornings every week on wednesdays , and still have an active campus following. Our health office is the main place students go for discounted over the counter medication such as aspirin for headaches , and benadryll for allergies to name a few.

Lately with counselors , there's been a surge in students making appointments so that its very hard to get a sit down with one of them to talk about your academic career.

It makes me wonder exactly how long have they been around for because they have not really been a "known" college in the area until recently. Schools in the area like UW - Green Bay , or NWTC have been around awhile to have some kind of familiarity to them but unfortunately , this school does not. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Career Services BoomerFan241 ITT Tech - Green Bay '08 Apr 14 , 2010 WARNING : for Profit Does Not Mean It Will Transfer D - Hardly any of my past college credits from my other degree transferred , which it would have if I went to a regular college or university. The Registrar office makes our class schedules out and determines what our classes will be for the next semester. When you first start school , they ask if you want to have morning or evening classes ( at least they did on my campus ) . I requested to have morning classes because of family reasons. I still ended up having to take evenings because that was the ONLY time they offered those classes AND they weren't sure when the next time those classes were being offered. I had to rearrange my life and schedule after being told that I was not going to be scheduled in the evenings. I am very disappointed in the range of availability the classes are being offered. The use of computer labs are limited and kept in poor condition , and half the time there are classes being held in the lab anyway. You are lucky if you can find a vacant seat if your instructor sends you to the lab to do an in - class assignment. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Academic Flexibility Mimi2000 ITT Tech - Green Bay '13 Mar 18 , 2010 My School A+ My school is unique because its a small campus witch means smaller class sizes.

Classes don't get canceled very often even when it snows , but the classes aren't far away , so it's not two bad. The weather on campus is usually better than in the town. The campus is very well taken care of , the grass is almost always green and is raked. So early fall and spring are just amazing here ; it gives you a need to be outdoors. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Weather crasmuss Jamestown '14 Biology Nov 04 , 2010 More Girls Than Guys A+ There are more girls at Jamestown than guys , but that's just what happens at private schools , but it's not really that noticeable. Most of the students come from around the midwest area , but there are plenty of other students from places like Alaska , Hawaii , Arizona , etc. There are also plenty of foreign students , especially Korean students. Most of the guys soccer team is from various contries , mostly england and belgium. Their accents are amazing!

I can choose which history class I want to take , and there are plenty of literature classes ranging from Shakespeare to American Short Stories. I have a lot of fun reading the summaries of the courses and choosing what I specifically want to learn about.

My school is unique in that it is the largest of 16 colleges in the Kentucky community and technical college system with 6 different campuses. However , you still get small class sizes of around 20 : 1 student to teacher ratio. This means more time to get 1on1 help with assignments and problems. You receive an education at about 3 times lower the price compared to universities. The only thing I don't like about JCC is the school spirit. Since there are no sports or activities , you don't get that atmosphere which I would love. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Overall Experience jobryan0034 Jefferson Community & Tech '12 Occupational Therapist Assistant Sep 03 , 2010 If You Look , It Is There A Anything I have needed has been made available to me.

I was a commuter ( living off campus ) for two years and was convinced to move onto campus and live with a friend this year. That was the second best decision of my academic career ( the first was buying my mac , lol ) . The community at Judson is great , it is a small school and you have the chance to get to know a lot of people while you are here. You have the chance to be somebody at Judson. The actual structures of the buildings are getting a little old , but they are paying a lot of recent attention to the dorms. My dorm that was built in the late 1960s ( Volkman Hall ), and the building is aging , but the room I'm in was just renovated summer 2009. If the dorms were a little newer , it would be nice , but recent renovations help a lot! 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing Herman07 Judson '07 Jan 02 , 2010 Transportation Is Ok B - You can get a PACE bus near Lindner Tower but there aren't any shuttles or buses to drive you around campus. Its ok tho because it's not that big and you can walk from one side to the other in 15 - 20 minutes tops. It's hard to find parking during the day. Your best bet would be to leave your car somewhere and get used to walking if you don't want tickets. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Transportation Herman07 Judson '07 Jan 02 , 2010 Housing Is Ok but Expensive B - Lindner Tower is the cleanest and newest , but it's very boring there. Wilson is for freshman / sophomore guys and it is fun but the guys there have too much spirit and the rooms are really old and it gets mildew. There is no airconditioner in any rooms except at Lindner and a handful of the apartments at Volkman. They have big screen TVs in a lot of the lounges at the dorms and pool tables / air hockey. 1 2 3 4 5 Report Campus Housing First Previous Page 1 of 2 Next Last Comparable Schools Northwestern University Olivet Nazarene University of Chicago Illinois at Chicago side - by - side comparison Northwestern University Location : Evanston , IL Tuition : $38 , 463 Room & Board : $11 , 703 Student Body Size : 8 , 540 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Olivet Nazarene University Location : Bourbonnais , IL Tuition : $23 , 590 Room & Board : $6 , 400 Student Body Size : 2 , 618 Admission Difficulty : Easy register to connect with this school University of Chicago Location : Chicago , IL Tuition : $39 , 381 Room & Board : $11 , 697 Student Body Size : 5 , 143 Admission Difficulty : Hard register to connect with this school Illinois at Chicago Location : Chicago , IL In - State Tuition : $12 , 034 Out - of - State Tuition : $24 , 424 Student Body Size : 14 , 888 Admission Difficulty : Average register to connect with this school</DIV></DIV>
