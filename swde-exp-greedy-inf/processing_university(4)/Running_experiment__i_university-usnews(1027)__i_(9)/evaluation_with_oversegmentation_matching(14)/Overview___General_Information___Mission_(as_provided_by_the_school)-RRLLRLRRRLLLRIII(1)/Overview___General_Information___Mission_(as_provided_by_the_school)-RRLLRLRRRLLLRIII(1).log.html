Through active and creative learning in a supportive community students are challenged to achieve excellence in their academic personal and professional lives and to contribute to a more socially just society." More recently our Ribbons of Excellence grew from our mission. In 1887 the seniors presented a cane symbolic of leadership and hard work to the junior class officers. It has been handed down every year by since and each class attaches a ribbon.  In 2007 our academic community adopted the idea of the ribbons to represent standards of excellence. These new "ribbons of excellence" are: 1) Caring for humanity and the world: making socially responsible decisions; providing service to local and global communities; interacting positively with persons of diverse cultures and backgrounds. 2) Learning throughout a lifetime: continuing to ask important questions; pursuing knowledge in each new age; remaining open to new learning experiences. 3) Thinking critically: developing critical habits of mind; exploring multiple points of view; raising thoughtful questions identifying problems and solutions. 4) Crossing boundaries and disciplines: developing literacy in multiple fields; personifying the liberal arts experience; making connections across disciplines. 5) Developing creativity: engaging in creative arts; developing creative talents and skills; recognizing and employing figurative expression.  These permeate our campus culture especially on Ribbons of Excellence Day as campus and community convene to celebrate scholarly and creative activities of our students. 

Adrian College offers numerous enriching educational experiences. Almost one quarter of last year's graduating class studied abroad. Many academic programs require internships or practicums giving students opportunities to apply their studies in real-world situations. Many courses are designed around service learning. Examples include Biology students working with the River Raisin Watershed Council Teacher Education students tutoring at local schools and Business students consulting for local non-profits. All majors require a Capstone Experience where seniors synthesize years of learning into a single project. We have also been the recipient of Fulbright Arabic Scholars for the past three years enriching our language offerings and campus culture. Adrian College is also proud to participate in Operation Education a program that helps wounded veterans earn an education. 

Adrian College is experiencing tremendous growth through its Renaissance campaigns which continue to transform our teaching learning and scholarly environments. Renaissance I brought new athletic facilities including a multisport performance stadium and ice arena and new programs including a marching band and the Athletic Training Program.  Renaissance II is bringing innovative educational opportunities. For example Rush Hall was transformed from an old bookstore to the home of the Communication Arts and Sciences program complete with new media studios sound rooms and editing labs and we have invested in several technology initiatives including smart classrooms digital library resources Blackboard and a significant increase in our Internet bandwidth to 90Mbps max throughput.

Renaissance II also prompted the creation of Institutes which integrate theoretical and practical learning in distinctive ways. These are the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies the Institute for Health Studies the Institute for Study Abroad the Institute for Ethics and the Institute for Law and Public Policy. Institutes promote interdisciplinary learning seek unique opportunities for students give a platform for student-faculty collaboration and foster projects that benefit our campus culture.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Our distinctiveness begins from our mission : "Adrian College , a liberal arts College in the United Methodist tradition , is committed to the pursuit of truth and to the dignity of all people.

In the Appalachian Mountains she found that education became her life's work.  She truly believed that these hills and hollows held the leaders of tomorrow. Thus Alice Lloyd College (ALC) was born.
From its inception Alice Lloyd College has placed a supreme value on educating the whole person. The name of the community Pippa Passes originated from a poem by Robert Browning called "Pippa's Song". Pippa was a poor mill child who passed through the surrounding villages singing lyrics that ultimately changed the troubled lives of the people she encountered. This great work became a symbol for one of the purposes of Alice Lloyd College: the influence of unconscious good upon the world.
It was Alice Lloyd and co-founder June Buchanan who saw the spirit of learning prevail both in and out of the classroom forming the basis of character education. The "Christian Forum" required students to discuss ethical and moral issues life's purposes and goals and Christian standards of conduct. These values were all significant in the total educational experience. Leadership was the desired result of character building.
Today this tradition remains a central focus of Alice Lloyd College. It is reflected in the leadership of its faculty and staff; Student Work Program; Caney Convocation Series; a special leadership course required of freshman students; and high standards of conduct dress and attitude.
Students and parents alike are reminded of the College's philosophy during orientation sessions. It is expected that students who have engaged in the Alice Lloyd College experience will not only be intellectually equipped to continue their pursuit of learning but will also be prepared as responsible citizens for a life of service and leadership.
The idea of working for an education at ALC is as old as the school itself.  Early students provided labor in exchange for tuition room and board. They were earning their own way on the path of becoming the leaders of tomorrow. Today tuition is guaranteed to qualified students residing in 108 Central Appalachian counties in parts of five states. At Alice Lloyd College every full-time student is required to work as a part of his or her overall educational experience.  So committed is the College to the concept of student leadership that successful completion of the work assignment is a graduation requirement. 
Alice Lloyd College provides a comprehensive leadership development program for its students. This training contains aspects of leadership philosophy citizenship and cultural development which build upon a strong traditional liberal arts education. The institution attempts to infuse leadership education initiatives into all aspects of the educational experience including formal classroom instruction; activities that enable students to experience cultures outside of Appalachia; group learning activities; involvement in service to others; and activities that place them in leadership roles. 
To accomplish this ideal the Academic Student Services and Work Program have become intimately connected in pursuing the mission of preparing leaders to serve Appalachia through a formal leadership development program. Through the years Alice Lloyd College has impacted many lives and in turn those people have become leaders in their communities and the region serving in roles such as doctors lawyers ministers political leaders and educators.

 A nationally recognized first-year experience program combines a variety of programs and experiences "both inside and outside the classroom" that prepare students to live and work in today's complex network of local regional and global communities.

Exchange programs with 41 universities in 17 countries make Appalachian part of the global academic family. More than 600 students explored the world in the 2009-10 academic year through study abroad opportunities selecting from more than 60 Appalachian overseas education programs. The Institute of International Education ranks Appalachian sixth in the nation among master's degree granting institutions for undergraduates studying abroad.

More than $14 million in research and service grants and contracts was awarded to the university during the 2009-10 academic year. Our faculty mentor students in research and creative endeavors. 

Located at 3333 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern North Carolina Appalachian provides a favorable location for learning to occur.

Located in Annandale-on-Hudson N.Y. the secluded school is close to the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains. Many students have views of the campus’s nearby scenery from their dorm rooms. First-year students must live in one of the campus’s 40 different residence halls and houses some of which have “alcohol free” “quiet” and “wellness” themes. For outdoor recreation students can go horseback riding canoeing hiking and biking. There are more than 80 clubs on campus and students are welcome to start new organizations. There is no elected student government at Bard and no Greek system either. More than half of Bard students study abroad before graduation. There are tons of student volunteer options like the Bard Prison Initiative a program that sends students to maximum- and medium-security jails throughout New York to tutor inmates. The Bard Raptors sports teams are members of the NCAA Division III Eastern College Athletic Conference. Freshmen at Bard start college earlier than their peers at most other schools arriving in early August for a three-week orientation to campus academic and community life known as the Language and Thinking Program.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Perhaps best expressed by Professor Chinua Achebe : "What you want to do as a teacher is to make people aware of the complexity of experience - that our little corner is real and very important , but it is not the whole. And we should make the effort to understand as much of the rest as we can possibly manage. This is not a threatening position : it is an enriching one. This is what education should aim to do : to draw out from us what is there so that it can interact with what's outside."</DIV></DIV>

Freshmen are not required to live on campus but 98 percent choose to do so. The school’s Urban New York program takes first-semester students to free events around the city and all Barnard women get student discounts on tickets to nearby on- and off-Broadway shows various sporting events and concerts.

Among the more than 110 student organizations are the Outing Club which sponsors outdoor and adventure trips throughout the year; the Brooks Quimby Debate Council; and WRBC the Bates radio station.

Close collaborations are fostered in small classes and research , but these are only the beginning of the academic journey. Debate overflows onto the quad and into the dining Commons and residence halls. Learning finds expression in good works in our neighborhood and around the globe. Bates is a friendly and unpretentious community whose members care deeply about ideas and principles and value their exchange and examination. Our students are stimulated by good talk , great books and artistic expression , and they welcome the hard academic work that is the price of discovery. Our professors are committed to developing , encouraging and supporting them in their intellectual and personal growth. Bates is recognized for its inclusive social character and progressive tradition. The College is rightly celebrated as one of the first U.S. institutions of higher learning to offer a truly equal - opportunity education. Since its founding in 1855 by Maine abolitionists , Bates has welcomed people from diverse racial , ethnic , religious and economic backgrounds. Bates continues to aspire to be a community in which students learn from their differences , and the College provides the support , resources and guidance for the hard and sometimes uncomfortable conversations across cultural boundaries. All activities , resources and facilities have always been open to all members of the Bates community. Bates has never allowed organizations such as fraternities or sororities that exclude people. Friendships that flourish among very different types of people , both faculty and students , exemplify the brightest facets of a Bates education. Bates strives to create a broadly diverse and deeply inclusive community that reflects and explores the world and prepares students for full and active participation in a global society.</DIV></DIV>

Students can volunteer year round through the school’s Urban Missions which coordinates service projects in the local community and Global Missions which sends students abroad. The student body is also active in faith-based activities. Each year students lead Be The Change a week of speakers and break-out sessions and events that give religion a global focus. Freshmen are required to live on campus and must also take a semester of Chapel attending worship services every Monday and Wednesday. Students and faculty gather daily for a campus prayer at noon and weekly for free ice cream floats during “Dr. Pepper Hour.” Students can also get involved in more than 250 student organizations on campus.

Choosing Erskine is not just going to college. It's about being part of it and thriving through close relationships with fellow students , faculty and staff. It's about developing the whole person by giving students the tools to succeed both professionally and personally. Our approach is different. At Erskine , we have smaller classes. We believe smaller class size creates a better educational environment and results in a friendlier campus. This emphasis on individual growth and relationships is part of what we call a "connected" education. Our student - faculty ratio of 12 : 1 makes for a very individualized learning experience. Erskine is about education. Our academic program has been recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the 2nd Best Baccalaureate College in the South , and rated in the Top 100 nationally by Forbes.com in 2008 Best Colleges Guide. Erskine's liberal arts education equips students in all majors with the core experiences from all disciplines , and creates the foundation for lifelong learning. Our students succeed as indicated by our having one of the highest graduate program placement rates in South Carolina. Our legacy of providing an outstanding education didn't begin yesterday. Erskine was founded in 1839 by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church , making us one of the oldest private liberal arts colleges in the Southeast. Erskine is about people. Our students develop lifelong relationships with the faculty and staff and experience college on a "first name" basis. Our faculty will tell you that they teach students , not classes. We often hear that being part of the student body at Erskine is like being part of a big family. And those bonds formed at Erskine serve as a stepping - stone for future success. Erskine is about faith. The Erskine experience is more than just an education. Erskine students understand that to make a difference in the world , hearts need to be changed , relationships developed and faith exercised. We believe that it is not only important what our students become , but also who they become. Erskine students are challenged by Christian faculty , engaged by their fellow students and prepared to go into the world to pursue God's calling. Through education , people and faith , Erskine students are forever connected.</DIV></DIV>

Faculty members write narrative evaluations to assess student work rather than reducing performance and progress to a letter grade.  The curriculum promotes engagement and collaboration rather than competition.  Students have the freedom and accountability to design their education to meet their personal and career goals without the limits of formalized majors or rigid requirements.  The curriculum is redesigned every year and upper division students can propose individual learning contracts to further customize their learning experience.
While in many ways Evergreen breaks the mold of traditional higher education - and in doing so opens up opportunities for students with a wide range of learning styles and career goals - the college delivers a high level of academic rigor.  The National Survey of Student Engagement sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts notes that Evergreen students tend to read more prepare more extensively for class make more presentations and engage more actively with faculty and each other than at the vast majority of colleges and universities nationwide.  Students have opportunities for research hands-on field study community service internships and study abroad.  
Evergreen is one of just three institutions on the West Coast included in the book "Colleges That Change Lives" by former New York Times education editor Loren Pope.  Pope notes that at these colleges "Learning is collaborative rather than competitive; values are central; there is a strong sense of community.  They are places of great synergy where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.  Aspirations are raised young people are empowered."
Evergreen is located in the vibrant state capital of Olympia.  Students can easily access the urban life of Seattle or Portland or the recreational opportunities of the Pacific Ocean Mount Rainier and the Olympic National Park all within a one- to two-hour drive.

The National Survey of Student Engagement , sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts , notes that Evergreen students tend to read more , prepare more extensively for class , make more presentations and engage more actively with faculty and each other than at the vast majority of colleges and universities nationwide. Students have opportunities for research , hands - on field study , community service , internships and study abroad. Evergreen is one of just three institutions on the West Coast included in the book "Colleges That Change Lives" by former New York Times education editor Loren Pope. Pope notes that at these colleges , "Learning is collaborative rather than competitive ; values are central ; there is a strong sense of community. They are places of great synergy , where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Aspirations are raised , young people are empowered." Evergreen is located in the vibrant state capital of Olympia. Students can easily access the urban life of Seattle or Portland , or the recreational opportunities of the Pacific Ocean , Mount Rainier and the Olympic National Park , all within a one - to two - hour drive. Evergreen's forested 1000 - acre campus features a half - mile of saltwater beach on Puget Sound , a Native American longhouse , an organic farm , and award winning , environmentally friendly architecture in its newest classroom and office complex. With a strong commitment to sustainability in operations , curriculum and policy , Evergreen has been noted as one of the nation's top 'green' colleges. The vast majority of Evergreen's 4700 students are undergraduates studying the liberal arts and the sciences , including natural and physical sciences. The college also offers graduate programs in Education , Environmental Study , Public Administration , and Teaching.</DIV></DIV>

When considering an applicant for admission Fairfield looks at measures of academic achievement students' curricular and extracurricular activities their life skills and accomplishments and the degree to which they have an appreciation for Fairfield's mission and outlook.  Students are challenged to be creative and active members of a community in which diversity is encouraged and honored. With its commitment to education for an inspired life Fairfield has developed a unique educational model to ensure that students receive the motivating guidance they need to reach their fullest potential. The integration of living and learning is at the heart of a Fairfield education.  Students learn what it means to be a fully engaged member of the campus community by participating in a living and learning community based on their interests.

These days the institution is a well-regarded liberal arts college home to top-notch research and innovative student programming. One unique component of life as an F&M student is the -esque living situation. All first-year students are assigned to one of four college houses known as Bonchek Brooks Schnader and Ware. Each house is overseen by faculty members called dons and prefects. In each College House students live together share meals and plan and attend events. Freshmen and sophomores must live in their college house and juniors and seniors can choose to as well. In addition to activities through the college houses students can choose from about 75 clubs and organizations including nearly a dozen fraternities and sororities. The Greek system draws more males than females; about 35 percent of men join compared to about 15 percent of women. The F&M Diplomats sports teams are members of the NCAA Division III Centennial Conference and are especially competitive in men’s basketball and women’s lacrosse. Academic and extracurricular life stops each Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. for Common Hour a small window of time for students and faculty to attend a campus-wide lecture movie snippet or event. The tree-lined campus is in walking distance of downtown Lancaster’s main attractions. Stores and restaurants stay open late for First Friday a lively celebration at the end of the first week of each month. On Third Fridays art galleries and performance centers typically host shows. Students can also check out a Barnstormers game at the city’s baseball stadium or shop for groceries and crafts in Central Market the country’s oldest continually operating farmer’s market.

Residing along the Spokane River it is less than half a mile to downtown Spokane Wash. On campus there are more than 95 active clubs for students to choose from. Intramural sports are very popular at Gonzaga with more than 60 percent of the student body participating. The Bulldogs of Gonzaga are part of the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference. The men’s basketball team is the pride and joy of the university and the team has returned the love by winning more than 90 percent of its games at the school’s McCarthey Athletic Center. At Gonzaga students are required to live on campus during their first two years but the university has stated that on-campus housing is not guaranteed for an entire college career. Students interested in outdoor pursuits can journey to the 100-acre Riverfront Park and go ice skating in the winter or check out the sky ride over the falls. They can also explore the Spokane River Centennial Trail a 37-mile paved trail perfect for walking running skating or biking.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Gonzaga University is not all basketball. Yes , the Zags have appeared in the last 13 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments , but it is Gonzaga's strong academic offerings that have distinguished this 120 - year - old university. Gonzaga offers 92 fields of undergraduate study in arts and sciences , business , engineering , education and professional studies. Student to faculty ratio is 10 : 1 , and faculty office hours are plentiful. Cura personalis , or care for the individual , is a hallmark of Jesuit education. Twenty six master's programs , a doctoral program in leadership studies and a juris doctorate through the School of Law complement the undergraduate programs. Gonzaga's freshman class averaged an 1 , 188 SAT score and a 3.66 high school grade point average in fall 2009. But perhaps even more impressive than the academic credentials of Gonzaga's students is their penchant to serve others , another pillar of Jesuit education. Over the past five years Gonzaga students have averaged 100 , 000 hours of community service annually. Special programs like Campus Kids ( mentoring at - risk grade school children ), Mission : Possible ( spring break trips to low - income parts of the country to help with revitalization ), and April's Angels ( an April renovation of an area school or camp ) are just a few of the efforts made by Gonzaga students for their neighbors and those in need.</DIV></DIV>

The oldest Lutheran college in Minnesota Gustavus was founded in 1862 by Swedish Lutheran immigrants and named for Swedish King Gustav II Adolf. Gustavus Adolphus College is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Throughout its history it has valued its Lutheran and Swedish heritages.

The Gustavus culture derives from our founding traditions and offers a distinctiveness of feeling and deed on the campus and in the greater world. Students and faculty pursue academic rigor and service in an atmosphere of close-knit relationships serious work spirited enjoyment of life and uncommon mutual support.

At Gustavus students receive personal attention in small-sized classes and engage in collaborative research with their professors. The College is fully accredited and known for its strong music science writing athletics study-abroad and service-learning programs. We maintain a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and are widely admired for our annual MAYDAY! Peace Conference-an event devoted to topics relating to human rights and social justice.

Gustavus is internationally recognized for its annual Nobel Conference. This signature event was launched in 1965 following a gathering on campus of 26 Nobel laureates for the dedication of the Nobel Hall of Science in 1963. The conference brings cutting-edge science issues to the attention of the public engages world-renowned science speakers and provides opportunities to explore the moral and societal impact of scientific issues. 

Gustavus has always prized community and has been marked by a pervasive sense of concern for every member of the College community. Civility mutual respect cooperation shared governance and caring have long been hallmarks of the College. Freedom to express a broad range of ideas is central to our sense of community and resolution of conflicts in the broader society has long been a fundamental concern for us.

Gustavus has a commitment to high quality even to excellence in all that we do. In the words of Eric Norelius founder of the College "Whatever we do let us do it well." Given our other values it should be clear that this commitment to excellence is neither a code word for elitism nor a rejection of the best in Gustavus's heritage. Indeed our distinctive heritage demands nothing less than excellence.

Gustavus holds the conviction that religious faith enriches and informs learning and is a fundamental notion underpinning our emphasis on community ethics and service.  While strongly Lutheran in tradition and character conformity to that specific faith tradition is not expected.  In it mission statement the College does declare an intent to develop in students "a mature understanding of the Christian faith".  People of all faiths are welcomed and engaged here.

The Swedish and religious heritage of Gustavus specifically its Lutheran roots and bonds have ensured that justice and fairness are primary institutional values. The College strives to be a just community in all of its actions and to educate its students for morally responsible lives. Relations within the College community are guided by high moral principles and those graduating from Gustavus are expected to understand the full moral implications of their actions.

The College values service as an objective of life and of education. We embrace the notion that true leadership expresses itself in service to others and affirm the classical ideal of a liberating education an education that frees one to serve God and humanity to the best of one's ability.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Gustavus Adolphus College is a residential , liberal arts college in St. Peter , Minnesota , that prepares 2 , 550 undergraduate students for lives of leadership , service , and lifelong learning.

Gustavus holds the conviction that religious faith enriches and informs learning and is a fundamental notion underpinning our emphasis on community , ethics , and service. While strongly Lutheran in tradition and character , conformity to that specific faith tradition is not expected. In it mission statement , the College does declare an intent to develop in students "a mature understanding of the Christian faith". People of all faiths are welcomed and engaged here. The Swedish and religious heritage of Gustavus , specifically its Lutheran roots and bonds , have ensured that justice and fairness are primary institutional values. The College strives to be a just community in all of its actions and to educate its students for morally responsible lives. Relations within the College community are guided by high moral principles , and those graduating from Gustavus are expected to understand the full moral implications of their actions. The College values service as an objective of life and of education. We embrace the notion that true leadership expresses itself in service to others , and affirm the classical ideal of a liberating education , an education that frees one to serve God and humanity to the best of one's ability.</DIV></DIV>

Hanover College students prepare for the future by embracing the present.  Hanover's students receive personal attention from professors in a highly caring environment.  The College's 10 to 1 student-faculty ratio and average class size of 12 students leads to interactive classes where students develop the skills necessary for critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential in today's rapidly changing world.

Individualized attention allows students to become actively engaged in experiential learning.  Experiential learning is supported through the availability of a tuition-free academic internship for any interested student.  Project-based internships through the College's business program the Center for Business Preparation enable Hanover's students to apply their critical thinking and problem-solving skills and develop a record of actual accomplishment before they graduate.  Additional internships through the Career Center including semester-long programs in Philadelphia and Washington D.C. provide opportunities for every student to explore careers and develop resumes during their four years at Hanover.  In addition nearly two-thirds of Hanover's students take advantage of conducting research in partnership with a faculty mentor.  Student research provides important experience that prepares them for medical school graduate school and business careers.  The result is outstanding placement of seniors in career opportunities or graduate school.

Hanover students are engaged nationally and internationally.  The Hanover Capstone on great issues of the day provides one such opportunity.  Our 2009-2010 Capstone entitled Forging an American Identiy included talks by Ric Burns (documentarian) and Jeff Shaara (best-selling novelist) among others. The 2008-2009 Capstone entitled Water: The Rise and Fall of Civilization led to on-campus lectures by Zahi Hawass (Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities) Mia Farrow (activist and actress) Bill Nye (The Science Guy) and Robert Kennedy Jr. (activist).  The 2007-2008 Capstone Global Climate Change included on-campus lectures by Jane Goodall Jean-Michel Cousteau Richard Leakey and Ed Begley Jr.  The culmination of each year's Capstone is the publication of an anthology of the best student papers on that year's subject.

Experience is also gained through the College's extensive study abroad program.  From four-week spring term courses that travel to countries such as England Ireland South Africa China and Vietnam to semester-long affiliated programs in Australia Turkey Belgium Germany France Spain and Mexico to summer research and internships in India Thailand Turkey and France roughly 55% of Hanover students have traveled throughout the world.  Most of these students received financial support from the College to assist them in taking advantage of this opportunity.

Students do not have to major in theatre and music to participate and be eligible for scholarships in those outstanding programs.  Every one of the College's 56 student clubs and organizations ranging from the campus newspaper to ultimate Frisbee are established and run by students.

The founders of Harvey Mudd College thus envisioned a distinctive educational experience for its students combining unusual breadth in their technical education with a firm academic grounding in the humanities and social sciences. The required curriculum has three components : the Common Core , which provides the foundation for advanced study ; the program in Humanities , Social Sciences , and the Arts which emphasizes the liberal arts nature of a Harvey Mudd College education ; and the Major , which builds depth and technical competence. Unifying all of these is an emphasis on strong oral and written communications , the development of computational skills , and direct experience with a research or design project. For example , Harvey Mudd College's signature Clinic Program provides students with an opportunity to work as part of a team on real projects that entrepreneurs , companies , or national laboratories sponsor. The academic programs are demanding , but the College fosters cooperation rather than competition under a successful student - led Honor Code. Almost every student lives on campus , where the atmosphere is characterized not only by trust , freedom , and responsibility , but also by a sense of humor , fun , and creativity. Students at Harvey Mudd College enjoy the kind of personal attention , small classes , and close working relationships with faculty mentors associated with the finest liberal arts colleges. Students also benefit from the advantages of a larger institution because of the unique Claremont University Consortium , whose member colleges are located across the street from one another and make available classes , dining halls , libraries , parties , sports teams , and other resources far beyond those any one such school could provide. Under the leadership of its new president , Maria Klawe , Harvey Mudd College has developed a vision for its future around six themes : ( 1 ) Innovation , Leadership , and Impact , Especially in Engineering , Science and Mathematics ; ( 2 ) Focus on Experiential and Interdisciplinary Learning ; ( 3 ) Unsurpassed Excellence and Diversity at All Levels ; ( 4 ) Nurturing and Developing the Whole Person ; ( 5 ) Global Engagement and Informed Contributions to Society ; and ( 6 ) Improvement of Infrastructure and Resources to Support HMC's Commitment to Excellence and Building Community.

Hobart College and William Smith College are coordinate liberal arts colleges which means that men attend Hobart College while women attend William Smith College. Male and female students attend classes together and share one campus but receive degrees from their respective college. Greek life is popular and prevalent among students at Hobart College but William Smith College does not offer sororities. Known as the Hobart Statesmen the college competes in the NCAA Division III except for men’s lacrosse which competes in the NCAA Division I Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Lacrosse League. The William Smith Herons compete in the NCAA Division III.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Through a challenging interdisciplinary , liberal arts curriculum , Hobart and William Smith Colleges prepare students to think critically and make astute connections. Since 2004 , our students have been awarded a Rhodes Scholarship , Gates Cambridge Scholarships , nine Fulbrights and three Morris K. Udall Scholarships. Recent graduates are teaching English in Japan , working for NGOs , and have accepted assignments in the Peace Corps and Teach for America. Others are working on Wall Street , Capitol Hill , or attending prestigious graduate and professional schools. In partnership with the Geneva and global communities and through robust programs in career development , study abroad , service , leadership and athletics , the Colleges foster an environment that values global citizenship , teamwork , ethics , inclusive excellence , social justice , and cultural competence. In maintaining this environment , the Colleges create opportunities to engage faculty and students with other languages and diverse cultures. While only 2% of college students nationwide study abroad , at HWS 59% do so on every continent except Antarctica. The Colleges rank in the top 20 nationally for off - campus programs according to The Princeton Review and were recently recognized by the NAFSA as one of five institutions in the nation to receive the Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization. Even those students who do not study abroad connect with diverse cultures and languages as 22% of the most recent incoming class identifies as multicultural. More than 50 languages are spoken on campus. These experiences enhance what takes place on campus in the academic and social lives of students and allows the community to delve into the broader intellectual world. The resulting campus community values multiple perspectives , respects difference and is committed to assuming an active role in the global community. Part of that commitment extends to protecting the earth itself. In 2007 , President Gearan signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment , making HWS a charter member of a national effort to reduce emissions of the gases responsible for global warming. Through The President's Climate Commitment Task Force , the HWS community continues to make the environment a priority , working to become carbon neutral by 2025. But that global focus doesn't mean HWS students aren't also actively committed to the Geneva community. In fact , Washington Monthly ranked the Colleges 17th in the nation for community service and civic engagement , and HWS have been named in "Colleges with a Conscience : An Engaged Student's Guide to College." In 2009 , President Gearan developed the Geneva Partnership to further deepen the Colleges' productive relationship with the City of Geneva , N.Y. During the 2008 - 2009 academic year , 34 , 655 hours of community service were performed by 1 , 520 students ( more than ?? of the student body ), and those trends have continued into the 2009 - 2010 academic year. By the time they graduate , nearly every HWS student has participated in service at least once , and the majority of students , faculty and staff recognize that their obligation to the community extends to making civic engagement a part of their daily lives. The academic program at Hobart and William Smith keeps this highly interactive environment alive through hands - on learning opportunities and service - learning courses. The academic program is set apart from peer institutions in terms of excellence and opportunity , and The Fiske Guide to Colleges has praised Hobart and William Smith's "innovative curriculum." This rigorous academic program challenges students to think expansively.</DIV></DIV>

The faculty staff and students embody the most diverse mix in the Commonwealth. More than 40 percent of the campus represent various ethnicities besides African American including students from Central America the Caribbean Asian countries and Europe. Several years ago KSU launched a Hispanic Initiative to better serve the needs of the Latino populations in Kentucky and to encourage more Hispanics to attend college. Since then more Hispanics have turned to KSU. KSU also reached across the ocean to establish research partnerships and exchange programs with colleges and universities in China Japan Korea and Taiwan. Now several KSU students teach English as a second language overseas or study in Asia while their counterparts stay in Frankfort and learn to be English as a second language teachers for their home countries.

KSU provides something for everyone from traditional liberal arts fare to business science agricultural studies fine arts nursing education criminal justice social work and aquaculture. In the last three years the graduate studies program has grown. KSU now offers master's degrees in aquaculture business administration environmental studies computer science public administration and the online master's in special education. The university continues to expand its course selection by introducing the new journalism/mass communications degree program and specializations for the master's in business administration. 

The only 1890 Land Grant institution in Kentucky KSU focuses on agricultural studies extension services competitive research and its program of distinction aquaculture. KSU's Community Research Service and Aquaculture faculty are breaking ground with their experiments and helping bolster the state's and nation's economy. 

For example aquaculture researchers are teaching Kentucky farmers how to cultivate a caviar shrimp and tilapia crop. The aquaculture department also partnered with the Frankfort Sewer Department to explore a new safer more effective way to harvest paddlefish while simultaneously cleaning wastewater. Aquaculture has become the fastest growing segment of agriculture in America and a booming business throughout the world. KSU leads the state in offering aquaculture as a viable cash crop alternative for former tobacco farmers. 

The Land Grant program staff also educates part-time and small farmers about how to make their land more profitable and how to sustain natural and financial obstacles through a series of outreach initiatives and workshops on campus. Meanwhile KSU students partner with Land Grant Community Research Service researchers to test theories conduct experiments and aid in national and international research which gives them experience for graduate school and their future careers and also allows them to publish and present their findings at local state and national competitions. 

In the past five years the message about KSU has spread. Applications and admissions have increased substantially making KSU the fastest growing university in Kentucky since 2006.

KSU's Community Research Service and Aquaculture faculty are breaking ground with their experiments and helping bolster the state's and nation's economy. For example , aquaculture researchers are teaching Kentucky farmers how to cultivate a caviar , shrimp and tilapia crop. The aquaculture department also partnered with the Frankfort Sewer Department to explore a new , safer , more effective way to harvest paddlefish while simultaneously cleaning wastewater. Aquaculture has become the fastest growing segment of agriculture in America and a booming business throughout the world. KSU leads the state in offering aquaculture as a viable cash crop alternative for former tobacco farmers.

Meanwhile , KSU students partner with Land Grant Community Research Service researchers to test theories , conduct experiments and aid in national and international research , which gives them experience for graduate school and their future careers and also allows them to publish and present their findings at local , state and national competitions.

The College fulfills its mission by pursuing three ideals: excellence in education the importance of community and the principle of service. These ideals were handed down to us by the Marist Brothers who founded the College. Although Marist is now an independent institution governed by a lay board of trustees the three ideals remain an integral part of the College mission.

The Marist ideal of excellence in education is achieved through an emphasis on quality teaching and distinctive learning opportunities. At the undergraduate level this begins with a firm foundation in the liberal arts and sciences. Through core courses and their major field of study students are educated to think logically and creatively be able to synthesize and integrate methods and insights from a variety of disciplines and effectively express their opinions both orally and in writing. Students are encouraged to consider the ethical dimensions of the subjects they study and to become more aware of their own values and the value implications of the choices they make in their public and private lives. They are also exposed to cultures other than their own through on-campus programs and study abroad.

In addition to offering undergraduate programs to traditional-age students Marist has a long history of serving the needs of adult learners for graduate degree completion and continuing education programs. The College offers these students an educational experience that meets the same high standards as our traditional undergraduate programs. Marist allows these students to balance their education with work and family responsibilities by offering flexible scheduling alternative methods of program delivery and satellite campuses.

Marist seeks to distinguish itself by the manner in which it uses information technology to support teaching learning and scholarship at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The College believes that by familiarizing our students with these advanced technologies it better prepares them to be productive members of society and lifelong learners.

The Marist ideal of community is based on the belief that we become a better institution through the active involvement of faculty staff students and alumni in the life of the College. At a time when social bonds in our society are tenuous we seek to develop a relationship between our community members and the College that will last a lifetime. We do this by nurturing the development and well-being of all our community members. Of particular importance is assuring that the life of students outside the classroom is supportive of the educational goals pursued inside the classroom. We strive to be a diverse community but also one united by a shared commitment to the free exchange of ideas consideration of the opinions of others and civility in all our interactions.

Finally Marist believes in the dignity of every human being and is committed to the principle of service. The College conducts programs for the disadvantaged a wide variety of programs that meet community needs and programs that broaden access to education. We encourage students faculty staff and alumni to make service an important part of their lives. Students are encouraged to become involved in campus activities programs that assist the less fortunate in our society and service projects throughout the Hudson River Valley and around the world. By sharing their time and talents students help make Marist a better place to live and learn while developing a sense of personal and civic responsibility.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">"Marist is dedicated to helping students develop the intellect and character required for enlightened , ethical , and productive lives in the global community of the 21st century."

Only freshmen students are required to live on campus but about 70 percent of students choose to remain on campus during their four years. MIT offers housing in one of the coolest dorms in the country commonly called " " designed by architect Steven Holl. The MIT Engineers boast more than 30 NCAA Division III Teams and their mascot is a beaver which MIT chose because of its "remarkable engineering and mechanical skill and its habits of industry." Each class designs a unique ring called the "Brass Rat" that is revealed at the beginning of junior year a tradition that dates back to 1929.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">The essence of MIT is our appetite for problems - especially those big , intractable , complicated problems whose solutions make a permanent difference. While MIT is a research university committed to world - class inquiry in math , science , and engineering , MIT has equally distinguished programs in the architecture , the humanities , management , and the social sciences. A diverse , supportive campus environment - with an incredible range of student groups and athletic and fitness opportunities - ensures that it's not all about the work. And in MIT's intensely creative atmosphere , the arts flourish in all their forms. MIT admits some of the most talented students in the world on a need - blind basis. The Institute is committed to meeting the financial need of each admitted undergraduate student through MIT scholarships ; the average student scholarship was over $25 , 000 per year in 2009. As a result , the MIT community is incredibly diverse , and organically collaborative , with students coming from many different backgrounds , across the country and around the world. Students are frequently encouraged to unite MIT's engineering excellence with public service. For example , the required senior capstone design course for mechanical engineering majors centers on making the world a better place through engineering. Recent years have focused on projects using alternative forms of energy , and machines that could be used for sustainable agriculture. Beyond academic coursework , MIT's D - Lab , Poverty Action Lab , and Public Service Center all support students and professors in the research and implementation of culturally sensitive and environmentally responsible technologies and programs that alleviate poverty and improve quality of life in low - income areas locally , nationally , and worldwide. The MIT community brings its energy and creativity outside the classroom as well with 400+ student - run groups , 33 varsity sports , 20 intramural sports , 30 club sports , and over 500 arts - related events on campus each year. Campus is just a short walk across the Charles River to Boston where students can enjoy the city's fabulous restaurants or take in Boston culture. Many programs around MIT allow students to get reduced - price tickets to various events , including the Boston Symphony Orchestra , the American Repertory Theater , and Bruins , Celtics , and Red Sox games. Students get free admission daily to the Museum of Science , the Museum of Fine Arts , and all Harvard University and MIT museums.</DIV></DIV>

The Academy began as a floating maritime trade school aboard the school ship USS Enterprise berthed next to the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor.  During its 117-year history the Academy has grown from an entering class of 40 cadets to a fully accredited four-year coeducational college granting baccalaureate and master of science degrees and with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1100.The present name was assumed in 1942 when the Academy moved from Boston to a Hyannis campus on Cape Cod.  In 1946 the Academy was authorized by the legislature to grant the Bachelor of Science degree.  By 1948 after utilizing a variety of different training ships during World War II the Academy obtained the USS Charleston.  The draft of the Charleston a former U. S. Navy gunboat exceeded the depth of Hyannis Harbor so the campus was again moved this time to its present location in the village of Buzzards Bay. 
The present undergraduate academic programs feature six distinct majors and emphasize a blend of the liberal arts and sciences with technical and professional studies.  Graduates of the Academy???s two oldest programs Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering earn two fold credentials: a fully accredited Bachelor of Science degree and a professional license as Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer (both unlimited as to waters or vessel size).  While adhering firmly to its original mission as a maritime college the Academy has diversified its degree offerings in response to a changing environment for higher education and the needs of a dynamic maritime industry.  The first degrees in Facilities and Plant Engineering (now Facilities Engineering) were awarded in 1993.  The first graduates of the Marine Safety and Environmental Protection program received the degree in 1995.  In 2004 the first Bachelor of Science in International Maritime Business degrees were awarded.  In 2008 the Academy awarded the first Bachelor of Science in Emergency Management.

Freshmen must live on campus which is also home to about 500 student organizations. The Greek system constitutes a large part of campus life with about a third of the student body involved in more than 50 fraternities and sororities. In fact the school often gets the moniker “Mother of Fraternities” because the Beta Theta Pi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as the “Cradle of Coaches” for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed as Miami RedHawks. The teams who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference were known as the Redskins until 1997 when the Miami Indian Tribe complained. (The tribe is also the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year older students often create a guide to life at Miami University called the “M Book.” Student couples who marry are known as “Miami Mergers” and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine’s Day when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Miami University in Oxford , Ohio , is a place of involved scholarship and teaching where all students are grounded in the liberal arts , encouraged to become citizen leaders , and infused with an excitement for learning and critical thinking.

In recent years , the College also has become a focal point of civic discourse with key community forums. Top regional , national , and international leaders such as Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell , the late Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto , humanitarian Paul Rusesabagina , and economist and editor of Newsweek International Fareed Zakaria have come to Molloy to focus on critical and timely issues. Molloy College continues to raise public awareness of critical issues through its "Public Square" television program airing on Telecare. Molloy recently launched two new initiatives. The Sustainability Institute at Molloy College is Long Island's first - ever venture combining environmental advocacy and sustainability education within an academic institution. Molloy also kicked off its new Irish Studies Institute with a presentation from The Honorable Bertie Ahern , the former Prime Minister of Ireland. By reaching out - to our students , our communities , and our global leaders - Molloy has built a rich , dynamic , and diverse educational environment over the past 50 years. It is within this welcoming , yet challenging , environment that Molloy College students develop that all - important confidence , that strong , "I will" attitude that enables them to succeed in their careers , and more importantly , to make a difference in our world.

The College community is characterized by its academic strength spiritual heritage competitive athletics and vibrant campus life. An Abbey education grounded in the liberal arts teaches a person how to seek the truth and to learn what is true good and beautiful. This background combined with the specialized work that each student does in his or her major and in a variety of co-curricular activities equips Abbey graduates to lead lives of integrity to succeed professionally to become responsible citizens and to be a blessing to themselves and others. The Catholic Benedictine traditions on which the College was founded over 130 years ago inform all aspects of campus life. Benedictine monks take three vows: stabilitas conversatio morum and obedienti. Translated simply they mean stability of life constantly turning towards and being improved by God???s grace and hearing and responding to the word of God. Belmont Abbey College provides a stable environment in which students faculty and staff listen discuss learn and grow. At the Abbey we like to think that John Henry Newman???s motto ???heart speaks to heart??? describe faculty-student relationships. Beginning with the First-Year Symposium a required course for all first year students the College engages in a targeted approach to introducing students to the Benedictine mission and to collegiate academics.

Our century - old co - op program alone which enables students to gain up to 18 months of professional work experience related to their major or interest includes a network of more than 2 , 000 businesses , nonprofit institutions , and government agencies in nearly 500 communities around the world. Students bring the knowledge gained from these diverse experiences back to the classroom , adding power to their academic studies. The same focus on engaging the world drives our faculty research. Faculty members of Northeastern , frequently working in collaboration through one of our 37 interdisciplinary research centers , are motivated by the quest to develop applications that society will find useful. Our research and academic partnerships with businesses , government agencies , and universities around the world help us advance this agenda. We maximize the potential of fundamental research to translate abstract discoveries into innovative solutions. In the same way , our experience - based programs maximize the potential of our students by empowering them to discover their professional passion and achieve their life goals by putting their aspirations into action while they are still in school. They leave Northeastern more confident and more sophisticated about the world , better prepared for leadership and more astute in navigating career paths , wherever they may lead.</DIV></DIV>

Naturally." at Northern Michigan University?  Well there are the snowy peaks.  And the crashing waves.  And the more than 400 miles of rivers and streams just minutes from your residence hall door.  But we also say it because you may find the fit so perfect - so natural - you'll never want to leave.  And at Northern learning comes naturally thanks to the great outdoors that serves as a natural extension of the classroom.

At Northern your future will come clearly into focus.  That's what happens when you're surrounded by people who want what you want: Your success.  Northern after all is known for having faculty who aren't just smart (though most have doctorates or are leaders in their fields) but who are caring people who will provide you with the personal attention you need to get where you want to go in life.  We offer 180 degree programs so we're sure to have the area of study you're most passionate about.

Recognized by U.S. News and World Report's ranking of America's Best Colleges Northern is a dynamic regional public university (located in the Upper Peninsula - or the "U.P.") on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Marquette Michigan (pop. 20714).  The city was named one of 30 "America's Most Livable Communities."  It's also one of Michigan's "Cool Cities" - and Marquette County received the National Civic League's "All-America County Award."

Our 350-acre campus and the surrounding area serve as a natural extension of our classrooms.  When you're researching mercury contamination in loons you won't just look at pictures - you'll see these birds up close.  Our Freshman Fellows program pairs selected fellows with a faculty member for collaborative research.  And thanks to our First Year Experience program you'll get off to a great start at Northern.  On campus you'll learn in places like our state-of-the-art Seaborg Science Complex which has more than two dozen labs and our beautiful Thomas Fine Arts facility with exquisitely acoustic Wenger practice studios and our sophisticated Art and Design facility which was recognized by the American Institute of Architects.  Our library is award winning too - and our sports and recreation complex includes the Superior Dome the largest wooden dome in the world.  The United States Olympic Education Center (USOEC) makes Northern one of only four Olympic training centers in the nation - and the only one located on a college campus.  Northern's campus has everything within walking distance.  When the winter winds are blowing you and your friends will stay warm - thanks to the enclosed walkways that connect many of our buildings.

And at Northern we keep you naturally connected.  Northern's Teaching Learning and Communication Initiatve (TLC) made us the first public university in Michigan to equip all full-time students with a ThinkPad (or MacBook for art majors) - loaded with the latest software - as part of tuition and fees.  In fact we guarantee you'll never have a computer that's more than two years old.  Northern is one of the largest computer notebook campuses in the United States.  We've even earned national and international awards for innovation in technology.

And sometimes the best way to learn is by doing - even by getting your hands a little dirty.  That's why Northern offers tons of opportunities for you to get real-world experience - before you have to enter the real world.  Maybe it's heading out to a white pine forest to study the nesting habits of bald eagles.  Or using the Dimension 1200 SST machine in the Human Centered Design Studio to create a plastic prototype of the funky coat rack you designed first as a three-dimensional computer model.  Perhaps it's preparing for a career in broadcasting using cutting-edge technology like ProTools HD and Final Cut Pro.  Or maybe it's interning with the Green Bay Packers or a senator in Washington D.C.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Why do we say "Northern.

North Park offers a distinctively Christian intentionally urban and purposefully multicultural educational experience. Forty years ago North Park declined an offer to relocate to the far north suburbs of Chicago deciding instead to stay invest and take advantage of a unique urban setting. The amazingly rich international and multi-cultural neighborhood of North Park the presence of global corporations and world class cultural resources of Chicago attract students as well as exceptionally qualified faculty devoted to teaching.

Rooted in the Christian tradition the educational North Park offers is both profound and practical balances freedom and disciplined responsibility and is formational and transformational of the whole person. The common curriculum which all students take is built around some of the great questions of life including: Who am I? What is Justice? What is true? What is a life of significance? Who is my Neighbor? North Park students develop into men and women with a passion to contribute to the common good of the planet in wide ranging careers in business health care government education and the non-profit sector including Christian ministries and the church. Students who are successful at North Park are regularly admitted into top graduate programs around the world immediately following college as well as within three to five years of graduation. Graduates from the North Park pre-med program have had an 85% admission rate into medical schools for the last twenty years.

The campus is located on a beautiful award winning park-like 30 acre campus in a vibrant and culturally diverse Chicago neighborhood. Four bus routes border the campus and the Brown Line of the train system stops just two blocks away. A student owned automobile is not necessary. Four residence halls house 600 students and another 525 students live in school owned houses and apartments on the campus.

North Park is a complexly diverse university welcoming undergraduate students from 40 states and 27 countries. Diversity is evidenced in terms of socio-economic factors race and ethnicity and the faith background of students. 

37 undergraduate majors and 26 minors are supplemented by another several special programs and pre-professional programs.

The Honors Congress is designed for high ability students and provides mentoring and enrichment in a variety of ways including coaching and mentoring for national scholarship competitions.

Forty years ago North Park declined an offer to relocate to the far north suburbs of Chicago , deciding instead to stay , invest , and take advantage of a unique urban setting. The amazingly rich international and multi - cultural neighborhood of North Park , the presence of global corporations , and world class cultural resources of Chicago , attract students as well as exceptionally qualified faculty devoted to teaching. Rooted in the Christian tradition , the educational North Park offers is both profound and practical , balances freedom and disciplined responsibility , and is formational and transformational of the whole person. The common curriculum which all students take is built around some of the great questions of life , including : Who am I? What is Justice? What is true? What is a life of significance? Who is my Neighbor? North Park students develop into men and women with a passion to contribute to the common good of the planet in wide ranging careers in business , health care , government , education and the non - profit sector , including Christian ministries and the church. Students who are successful at North Park are regularly admitted into top graduate programs around the world immediately following college as well as within three to five years of graduation. Graduates from the North Park pre - med program have had an 85% admission rate into medical schools for the last twenty years. The campus is located on a beautiful , award winning , park - like 30 acre campus in a vibrant and culturally diverse Chicago neighborhood. Four bus routes border the campus and the Brown Line of the train system stops just two blocks away. A student owned automobile is not necessary. Four residence halls house 600 students and another 525 students live in school owned houses and apartments on the campus. North Park is a complexly diverse university , welcoming undergraduate students from 40 states and 27 countries. Diversity is evidenced in terms of socio - economic factors , race and ethnicity , and the faith background of students. 37 undergraduate majors and 26 minors are supplemented by another several special programs and pre - professional programs. The Honors Congress is designed for high ability students and provides mentoring and enrichment in a variety of ways , including coaching and mentoring for national scholarship competitions. In 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 , a total of four North Park students have been awarded international Fulbright Scholarships for their year following graduation.</DIV></DIV>

Among the 150 or so student organizations are the Student Senate Oberlin Film Series and Swing Dance. Athletics play a big role in student life as well and Oberlin fields more than 20 NCAA Division III athletic teams known as the Yeomen. Intramural sports include bowling 4-on-4 basketball frisbee and squash. All students are required to live either in College housing or an Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA) co-op. OSCA Oberlin’s largest student organization offers an alternative to College-run housing and dining.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Oberlin's combination of a leading liberal arts college and a world - class music conservatory creates an unparalleled learning environment. As one of the nation's premier liberal arts colleges , Oberlin is committed to rigorous academics , artistic excellence , and social justice. Oberlin College was the first in America to adopt a policy to admit students of color ( 1835 ) and the first to award bachelor degrees to women in a coed program ( 1841 ) . Our esteemed history of challenging intellectual and social conventions continues to shape the student experience today. Our learning community prizes creativity and individuality while upholding high standards of intellectual inquiry , debate , and service to society. While faculty members are focused on undergraduate teaching , they often make significant contributions to their fields through writing , research , and performance. Oberlin students join and create more than 150 of their own organizations. Each year more than 1 , 200 participate in community service. Nearly 75 percent go abroad for learning experiences during their college careers. Since 1920 , more Oberlin graduates have earned PhDs than have graduates of any other four - year institution. During the January Winter Term , students explore the value of self - education. They devise and pursue programs of independent study or research on or off campus. In the Business Scholars Program , for example , students interact with alumni to learn about careers in finance and consulting. The Creativity & Leadership Program , open to students in any major , offers entrepreneurship courses and grants to help students put innovative ideas into practice. About 170 are enrolled in a five - year , double - degree program to earn baccalaureates in music and liberal arts. Students in the arts and sciences and the conservatory share residence and dining halls in the same location , joined in their commitment to pushing the boundaries of their determination , intellect , and creativity. Music students broaden their education with classes in the liberal arts , and share their talents on campus in nearly 500 performances annually. In Feb. 2010 , President Obama presented the conservatory with the National Medal of Arts , the highest U.S. award given to artists and patrons. Oberlin's commitment to artistic expression includes an abundance of performances in theater , dance , poetry , popular music , and improvisational comedy. The Allen Memorial Art Museum collection ranks among the top five of any academic museum in the country. The Science Center ( 2002 ) is designed to promote collaboration across disciplines. Research labs include a supercomputer , confocal microscope , and 600 - MHz NMR spectrometer. Each summer about 100 students receive stipends to work with faculty in science , social science , and the humanities. Campus architecture is also distinct with buildings designed by Cass Gilbert , Minoru Yamasaki , Robert Venturi and William McDonough. The Environmental Studies Center features the largest photovoltaic array in Ohio , and is one the largest solar - powered academic buildings in the country. This model for green architecture includes an interactive display of how the building systems utilize renewable resources to provide heat , electricity , and recycle wastewater. Opening in 2010 is a LEED platinum - rated facility for jazz studies and music recording that is the world's first green building for music. About 90 percent of Oberlin students live on campus. Students may opt to live in one of nine program houses , including Afrikan Heritage House , Asia House , German House , and Third World House.

We do this by helping students strive for excellence in all areas of life including the training of the mind and spirit. In this sense Pacific Union College offers students a complete whole-life education. 

One of our greatest strengths is our commitment to undergraduate education. We are truly a teaching community and our goal is to provide an exceptional learning environment for our students. This means smaller classes where professors teach the courses not graduate assistants and plenty of opportunities for students to interact with faculty and staff. At PUC it is common for students to find a worthy mentor in a teacher residence hall dean or even the college president. Many professors choose to open up their homes for department dinners offering students a home-cooked meal. The majority of the faculty and staff also attend the college church where they worship side by side with students.  We believe that authentic relationships between college staff and students are integral to the educational experience. 

Academically PUC has received numerous accolades. Along with consistently high ratings from the U.S.News & World Report's "America's Best Colleges" PUC's students score above the 90th percentile in several Major Field Achievement Tests. We offer excellent pre-professional programs and many of our students are accepted into the nation's most prestigious graduate law medical and dental programs.  The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) has given PUC its most favorable rating. 

As a Christian organization we have a commitment to provide an environment where faith can thrive. We encourage our students to thoughtfully examine their personal faith in the classrooms residence halls and worship programs. Honest and intellectual exploration of ideas is central to the faith journey at PUC.

Pomona’s founders envisioned "a college of the New England type" when they created this school with small classes and strong student-faculty relationships. Pomona is a member of the NCAA Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. On-campus housing is guaranteed if requested and more than 97 percent of students live in the 12 dorms two-thirds of which contain single rooms. Pomona offers more than 200 student organizations. A well-known secret club called "Mulfi" has left cryptic notes with social commentary around campus since the 1940s. Students can also get involved with the three campus fraternities.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Pomona offers its 1 , 500 students - evenly divided between men and women - a comprehensive curriculum in the arts , humanities , social sciences and natural sciences. With a student - faculty ratio of eight to one , students have the opportunity to work closely and collaboratively with professors who are also top scholars in their fields. Students and faculty challenge each other in laboratories , classrooms , and co - curricular activities , and everyone benefits from the energy generated by such an assemblage of sharp and eager minds. Friendships forged among Pomona faculty and students frequently endure far beyond the four years of college. Few institutions offer Pomona's ability to combine intimate qualities as an average class size of 14 with such large - scale resources as a two - million - volume library. Fewer have enrolled as talented and high achieving a student body which is as happy with their environment and choice. As the founding member of The Claremont Colleges , a unique consortium of seven independent institutions on adjoining campuses , Pomona offers its students the experience of a small , academically superb liberal arts college and the breadth of academic and social resources normally associated with major universities. Students challenge and learn from one another not only in the classroom but also in daily life. On - campus housing is guaranteed , and few students choose to live anywhere else. The extraordinary ethnic and social diversity of its student body gives Pomona a broader mix of backgrounds than just about any comparable educational institution. Our location - within an hour of the Pacific Ocean , the Mojave Desert , the San Gabriel Mountains and the city of Los Angeles - informs and shapes daily life at the College. There aren't many places in the world where you can ski in the morning , play on the beach in the afternoon , and take in a major league baseball game or an opera at night. Beyond the recreational and cultural possibilities , our location offers unequalled opportunities for field study , community involvement and internships. Pomona students are so varied that they resist easy categorization. They embrace new ideas , take initiative , ask questions and challenge the status quo. They are as academically capable a group as any college or university can claim , and they are interested in doing something important with their talents. Our students share a spirit of openness and collaboration. Our students are competitive but not cutthroat - a very important distinction. They work hard , but don't compare grade point averages to peers. Maybe it's the weather or the palm trees but , we tend to think it's something more : a cooperation fostered by faculty in the lab and classroom. Professors encourage collaboration , and many students continue working together after class , forming study groups that meet in the residence halls , in lounges and computer labs and over laptops and shakes at the Coop Fountain. Students come to Pomona from every state in the nation and from many other countries , from private and public schools , from large cities , suburbs and towns so small they don't appear on most maps. More than one - third are students of color , and a substantial portion are in the first generation of their families to attend a four - year college or university. To maintain the remarkable strength and variety of Pomona's student body , the College's financial resources are critical. For U.S. citizens and permanent residents , admission decisions are made without consideration of a student's financial circumstances. Over half of Pomona's students receive financial aid from the College to support their study , and the College meets 100 percent of the demonstrated financial need of every enrolled student. This practice ensures that the most capable students will always be able to enroll at Pomona regardless of their financial circumstances.</DIV></DIV>

That's the invitation and promise offered by Providence College to 3 , 800 undergraduates each year. It's an invitation for students to find themselves and their direction in life , and to thrive in an environment that challenges them on every level : mind and body , heart and soul. It's a promise inspired by the Dominican Friars , a Catholic religious order dedicated to the pursuit of truth and to a spirituality that embraces the whole person.

PC is committed to increasing need - based financial aid and does not require that SAT or ACT test scores be submitted as part of the admission process. The Committee on Admission conducts a holistic review that considers each candidate's academic achievement in a rigorous high school curriculum , extracurricular activities , recommendations , a writing sample , and personal qualities. The PC experience is characterized by collaborative teaching and active learning. Interdisciplinary thinking begins with the two - year Development of Western Civilization Program - a key part of a Core Curriculum that challenges all freshmen and sophomores to seek truth by asking difficult questions , challenging conventional wisdom , and defending their conclusions. Through such intellectual pursuits , students learn how to reason well , to examine sources critically , to reconcile opposing points of view , and to write and speak effectively. Students choose academic majors in disciplines that range from the arts and sciences to the new School of Business , education , and interdisciplinary majors such as global studies and public and community service studies. Pre - professional advisors assist students pursuing careers in medicine and law. For students unsure about a major , faculty in the Undeclared Advising Program provide guidance.

PC offers study abroad opportunities through its Center for International Studies and internship options with the Office of Career Services. In residence halls and classrooms , on the playing fields , through Campus Ministry and more than 100 other extracurricular activities , students are involved with each other and their community. PC boasts a rich tradition of intercollegiate and intramural athletics. Friar teams compete in top NCAA Division I conferences including the BIG EAST and HOCKEY EAST.

In the last 12 years , the College has invested more than $165 million in capital projects including construction of a fitness center , a suite - style residence hall , a performing arts center , an artificial - turf field , and a campus chapel. Renovations to existing facilities have created a new science complex with spacious biology , chemistry , and physics labs - significantly expanding opportunities for faculty and students to collaborate on research projects traditionally associated with research - based universities. Other improvements include numerous multi - media classrooms and enhanced services and amenities at the campus library , student center , dining halls , and other learning and living areas. Direct flights from T.F. Green Airport reach over 20 destinations nationwide and bus and train transportation make Providence easily accessible to major cities in the Northeast , including Boston and New York.</DIV></DIV>

Instead students—or Reedies as they’re called—can select from about 150 other student organizations and can compete on intramural and club sports teams. Professors assign a letter grade for coursework but students will only be informed of the grade if it is below a C. There is no dean’s list or honor roll because the school evaluates students on a pass or no-pass scale. Out of classes which tend to be rigorous there are celebrations throughout each semester to keep students entertained. In the fall students gather for the Halloween Harvest Ball among other formal dances and the campus celebrates the end of classes each spring with the weekend-long Renn Fayre Festival. Freshmen do not have to live on campus but they are guaranteed a dorm room. Portland a city of more than 1 million people is about a 15-minute bus ride away. To enjoy Oregon’s outdoors students can join in on planned Outing Club trips or organize their own. Skiers and snowboarders may want to take advantage of the Reed ski cabin a lodge in Mount Hood where students alumni and faculty can stay. The ski cabin is less than 90 minutes from campus by car.

Scripps is a member of the Claremont Colleges consortium which also includes    and . There are a variety of student clubs on campus ranging from cultural organizations to academic interest groups recreational clubs to fine arts and performing groups. Most students live on campus in one of the nine residence halls or apartments. A few popular campus locations are the Motley Coffeehouse a nonprofit student-run coffee house and the Sallie Tiernan Field House a state-of-the-art athletics and fitness center. Scripps fields joint athletic teams with Claremont McKenna and Harvey Mudd known as the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Athenas.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">For the women of Scripps College , academic and extracurricular opportunities abound. Students work with a faculty of distinguished teachers , scholars , and researchers who believe their first responsibility is to stimulate and support undergraduate learning. Seminar - style classes taught only by professors -- never teaching assistants -- ensure that students share ideas in a supportive , interactive atmosphere. At the cornerstone of Scripps' academic program is the Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Humanities , which challenges Scripps women not only to think , but to think about the way they think. The Core program looks at the many connections among culture , knowledge , and representation across a number of disciplines , encouraging students' critical awareness of the limits of disciplinary methods and theories. Scripps' Off Campus Study program further encourages students to apply their learning to global experiences by studying abroad for a semester or a year. And by requiring a senior thesis based on research in the major , Scripps stimulates independent thought and a lifelong commitment to original inquiry. As a result of their superb liberal arts education , Scripps graduates go on to attend some of the most prestigious graduate schools in the nation and take on leadership positions in a wide range of fields and endeavors. As part of The Claremont Colleges , a community unique to American higher education , Scripps offers its students the best of both worlds. Students receive the personal attention of a small residential college while benefiting from the academic and social resources of a larger university. With five undergraduate colleges literally next door to one another , The Claremont Colleges provides expanded intellectual , athletic , and extracurricular opportunities to students and faculty at each of the individual colleges. The Joint Science Department , a collaboration of Scripps , Pitzer , and Claremont McKenna Colleges , allows students to take advantage of remarkable research opportunities in pre - medicine and science ; Scripps' science students frequently receive national recognition for their work. Scripps' Claremont location gives students easy access to Los Angeles beaches as well as San Gabriel Mountain skiing , and all the offerings and energy of Southern California. Scripps' campus , considered one of the most beautiful in the United States , is on the National Register of Historic Places. Scripps remains a women's college because it believes that having women at the core of its concerns provides the best environment for intellectually ambitious women to learn from a distinguished faculty and from each other. The College's largely residential population of fewer than 1 , 000 students encourages women to actively participate in their community and to develop a sense of personal and social responsibility. Scripps believes that this form of challenging and individualized education will best prepare women for lives of confidence and success. A current student sums up her college experience so far : The small - campus atmosphere of Scripps provides me with the comfort and support I need to create a home away from home , but it never lets me settle. I have been pushed and encouraged to expand my community and breadth of learning at every opportunity. The students and professors here are incredibly passionate and active ; many classes and campus groups , as well as the academic emphasis on off - campus study , allow us to pursue our goals and get involved with external communities and organizations , extending the Scripps family well beyond the walls of Honnold Gate. I thank my college for this unique experience.</DIV></DIV>

Unlike most other schools wearing pajama-like clothing or jeans is not a rite of college passage at the southern Tennessee college of Sewanee—University of the South. In fact it’s not even allowed. Sewanee students dress up for every class a tradition meant to honor the sanctity of education. After class students may need to change clothes if they want to explore all of the campus’ surrounding wilderness. Known as the Domain the southern Tennessee campus has nearby opportunities to rock climb mountain bike and cave. More than 95 percent of all students live on campus and freshmen are required to live on campus. The campus is also home to about 100 student clubs and organizations including more than 20 very popular fraternities and sororities. The Sewanee Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. The football team plays on the oldest field in the South. Sewanee has 36 majors and writing as a skill is stressed in all of them. Each summer the school hosts the Sewanee Writers’ Conference a congregation of esteemed authors and journalists. Nearly half the student body studies abroad doing their college tenure and for shorter trips within Tennessee the campus is a 45-minute drive from Chattanooga and 90 minutes from Nashville.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">The University of the South , known familiarly as Sewanee by its students , faculty , staff , alumni and friends , offers an unmatched educational experience characterized by serious intellectual engagement between faculty and students. Relationships that begin in the classroom extend to all facets of life here , and it is not unusual for students and faculty members to work shoulder to shoulder on research projects , journal articles , to meet for dinner or coffee at a local eatery , or to serve together as members of the University orchestra , volunteer fire department , and other civic groups. In these ways , the Sewanee experience prepares its students for lives of integrity , achievement and service. Since its founding , the College of Arts and Sciences at the University has graduated 25 Rhodes Scholars , a record that is unmatched by all but a handful of institutions , 38 Watson Fellows , and 24 NCAA Postgraduate Scholars , while the institution's School of Theology has added to its alumni ranks countless bishops , including three of the last four presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church. The University is located atop the Cumberland Plateau between Nashville and Chattanooga , Tennessee. Sewanee's physical environment , which includes a 13 , 000 - acre campus , provides an unparalleled place for study , reflection , and recreation and has , over its history , become a meeting place for some of America's most respected literary figures. It is home to the well - known Sewanee Writers Conference , the Sewanee Review ( the nation's longest continuously published literary quarterly ), and holds the copyrights to Tennessee Williams' body of work , which was left to the school by the playwright.</DIV></DIV>

Each house is home to between 10 and 100 students allowing for socialization among students from all classes.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">What draws students to Smith College is the intellectual challenge and rich extracurricular experience offered by an outstanding top - ranked liberal arts college. The rigorous academic program is demanding yet flexible. Smith's broad open curriculum - anchored in the sciences and the humanities and arts - allows unlimited choices. Although each first - year student is required to complete at least one writing - intensive course , there are no other required courses outside a student's field of concentration. With more than a thousand course offerings in more than 50 areas of study , the curriculum is rich in cross - disciplinary explorations of issues and scholarly conventions outside the Western standard. A host of unique study abroad programs in addition offer opportunities for students to expand their liberal arts curriculum. The Smith environment promotes faculty - student collaboration , and some of the research projects born of that teamwork are legendary. For every 9 students there is a Smith professor to encourage , guide and inspire. Smith professors are a world - class group of scholars who are engaged and accessible who consider teaching undergraduates to be their most important job. In 1999 , Smith became the first women's college in the nation to offer a program leading to a degree in engineering. At Smith , students are trained as engineers and at the same time educated broadly in the liberal arts. As with its engineering students , Smith is devoted to developing the best in each student. The college gives Smith students the ability to harness their skills and knowledge in a wide variety of opportunities that , in addition to academic coursework , includes internships , study abroad programs and leadership positions. Smith's New England campus is located on 147 acres of tree - lined paths and streets.

For more than 150 years the mission of St. Francis has been to provide an affordable quality education to working class people who otherwise may not be able to attend college.  Hundreds of successful graduates were the first in their family to attend college.  Merit based scholarships that can include full tuition for graduating high school students with a 1200 on their SAT's  are the cornerstone of the College's financial aid program.  Additional partial scholarships for students with SAT scores ranging from 970 to 1050 as well as $3000 and $5000 academic achievement grants are also part of the generous aid packages.
Students participate on 19 Division I athletic teams including Men's and Women's Basketball Men's Soccer Women's Volleyball and the nationally ranked Men's Water Polo team and Women's Bowling team.

All incoming freshman are required to take a one credit course entitled SFC 1001 which teaches time and stress management , success strategies , how to search for a major and a career , as well as where to get help while at St. Francis. Many go on to take SFC 2001 , a life lessons course aimed at helping students in their sophomore year. This course gives students practical advice on things like how to search for a job or graduate school , how to prepare for an interview and how to make and keep connections with successful graduates of St. Francis.

Our main campus in Saint Leo Florida--35 minutes north of Tampa--is home to our vibrant University College serving the education needs of more that 1500 traditional-age undergraduate students.  The university also offers a variety of dynamic graduate programs; a weekend and evening program for working adults; both undergraduate and graduate degree programs through 17 education centers in six states and through our Center for Online Learning which houses the university's cutting-edge online degree programs.  

At Saint Leo University outstanding teaching and active learning go hand in hand.  Caring and capable faculty provide our students with knowledge guidance academic support and a broad range of learning opportunities--both in and outside the classroom.  Small classes allow faculty to give each student personal attention.  A recent nation-wide survey on student engagement confirms that Saint Leo University students rate their interaction with faculty significantly higher than do students at other similar universities.  And our students tell us they love the university's active teaching-learning model because it enables them to collaborate on assignments discuss readings and participate in research projects outside the classroom.  Not many universities can boast as we can that their undergraduate students are encouraged to present their work at national academic and professional conferences.

Many of our alumni tell us that their bonds with faculty have remained strong over the years.  They say the mentoring coaching and other outside-the-classroom interactions with faculty helped them achieve much more than they ever thought possible.   They report that they learned not just how to succeed in the classroom but also in life.  As students they were encouraged to be well-rounded: to learn to think for themselves to be active participants and to give back to their communities.  Today Saint Leo University continues to encourage service-learning.  In a recent student survey 95 percent of University College freshmen and 82 percent of seniors said they perform community service each year.  

Saint Leo University is a place where values are more than just words on a wall.  Respect integrity personal development responsible stewardship community and excellence are part of the daily fabric of life on our main campus and throughout the university system.  Our values derive from our Benedictine traditions and from our commitment to make our students love the person they will become.  These values are what make Saint Leo students and its graduates special.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Founded in 1889 , Saint Leo University is now recognized as one of the nation's leading Catholic teaching universities and a school of international consequence. Our main campus in Saint Leo , Florida -- 35 minutes north of Tampa -- is home to our vibrant University College , serving the education needs of more that 1500 traditional - age undergraduate students. The university also offers a variety of dynamic graduate programs ; a weekend and evening program for working adults ; both undergraduate and graduate degree programs through 17 education centers in six states and through our Center for Online Learning , which houses the university's cutting - edge online degree programs. At Saint Leo University , outstanding teaching and active learning go hand in hand. Caring and capable faculty provide our students with knowledge , guidance , academic support , and a broad range of learning opportunities -- both in and outside the classroom. Small classes allow faculty to give each student personal attention. A recent nation - wide survey on student engagement confirms that Saint Leo University students rate their interaction with faculty significantly higher than do students at other similar universities. And our students tell us they love the university's active teaching - learning model because it enables them to collaborate on assignments , discuss readings , and participate in research projects outside the classroom. Not many universities can boast , as we can , that their undergraduate students are encouraged to present their work at national , academic and professional conferences. Many of our alumni tell us that their bonds with faculty have remained strong over the years. They say the mentoring , coaching , and other outside - the - classroom interactions with faculty helped them achieve much more than they ever thought possible. They report that they learned not just how to succeed in the classroom , but also in life. As students they were encouraged to be well - rounded : to learn , to think for themselves , to be active participants , and to give back to their communities. Today , Saint Leo University continues to encourage service - learning. In a recent student survey , 95 percent of University College freshmen and 82 percent of seniors said they perform community service each year. Saint Leo University is a place where values are more than just words on a wall.

The Campus Ministry organizes specialized retreats and mission trips throughout the year and the on-campus church holds a daily Mass. The Saint Louis Prayerbook is an online database of prayers—some traditional others original and submitted by students or faculty members. In addition to religious extracurriculars students can also choose from more than 150 student organizations at SLU including close to 20 fraternities and sororities. Most freshmen and sophomores must live on campus unless they commute from a parents’ home are married or have been in the military for at least two years. In total about 90 percent of freshmen live on campus all in halls exclusively for first-year students. Students can get involved in campus leadership positions as early as the second semester of freshman year. The St. Louis Billikens compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference.

When the record number of students returned to campus , they were greeted by a number of new majors and enhanced programs , including civil engineering , environmental studies , health management and health informatics. The University also completed a major overhaul of its communication program , including a new state - of - the - art , 8 , 500 - square - foot digital media center. While new academic programs were getting under way , others were being planned. Starting in fall 2010 , SLU will offer a master's degree in sustainability - the first of its kind in the Midwest. In addition , the university has approved other new programs for fall 2010 , including an undergraduate degree in community health and an accelerated master's degree that prepares nurses to take a leadership role in providing patient care. New centers of excellence were unveiled as well in 2009 - 2010 , including the Federal Aviation Administration - funded National Center for Aviation Safety Research. The university also received a $5 million grant from a private foundation to launch a new Center for Sustainability - a first for the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities. The 2009 - 2010 academic year has been an exciting time for scientific discovery and life - changing breakthroughs at the university. During FY 2009 , SLU received nearly $61 million for research , including funding from the National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation and Centers for Disease Control. In 2009 , SLU's School of Medicine joined the frontline of the nation's fight against H1N1 influenza. The university was one of eight elite institutions chosen by the National Institutes of Health to conduct vaccine trials. In October 2009 , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius visited the university's renowned Center for Vaccine Development where the vaccine was tested on adults , children and pregnant women. The university's internationally respected Earthquake Center received federal stimulus monies in 2009 to upgrade earthquake monitoring stations in the Midwest. SLU's School of Public Health - the only accredited school of public health in Missouri - continued its leading role in a landmark study on the environmental and genetic factors that influence the development of disease in children. Recognition for the university's scientific prowess also came from unlikely arenas. Major League Baseball selected Quantum Weather , a revolutionary forecasting system invented by SLU meteorologists , to provide the official weather predictions for the 2009 All - Star Game in St. Louis. The university was selected to be the official forecasting partner of the St. Louis Cardinals. The university continued to earn national accolades for its academic excellence. Among them , philosophers from around the world named several of SLU's graduate philosophy programs among the best in the English speaking world ( Philosophical Gourmet Report ) . The 2009 - 2010 academic year also saw the appearance of major figures on the campus. Among them , UN Secretary General Ban Ki - Moon spoke at SLU in his first official trip to the Midwest since being elected to the post. In addition to academic and research excellence , the University demonstrated its commitment to community in a record - breaking way. Students , faculty and staff contributed more than 1 million service hours , the most in university history. In one of the more significant individual examples of SLU service , the university worked with community partners to open Casa de Salud in 2010. Meaning "House of Health" in Spanish , Casa de Salud is a new wellness clinic for the under served Hispanic community in St. Louis. With these high points in academics , research and service , Saint Louis University continues to move forward as it approaches 200 years.</DIV></DIV>

Our mission is "to educate the whole person so that each graduate thinks acts and leads with courage toward the creation of a more just and compassionate world." EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING: Stonehill is in the top 10% of colleges nationwide in enriching educational experiences such as internships study abroad and co-curricular programs according to the National Survey of Student Engagement. Over 80% of our students complete an internship study abroad or practicum and field experience by the time they graduate. Stonehill students intern nationally and internationally in locations from New York City Washington D.C. and Boston to Dublin London Paris and Geneva. The Institute of International Education ranks Stonehill 16th in the country among baccalaureate institutions for semester study abroad programs. A total of 262 Stonehill students studied abroad this academic year in programs that spanned 24 countries from China to Russia and South Africa to New Zealand. CORNERSTONE PROGRAM: The core of Stonehill's "liberal arts-plus" curriculum is the Cornerstone Program. Through this initiative students are prepared for a life of learning leadership and responsible citizenship by taking interdisciplinary Learning Communities courses in ethics the sciences language and more and a major Capstone course for seniors in which students demonstrate mastery of their academic discipline. INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION: Classes are kept small so that Stonehill's accomplished and accessible faculty can champion and challenge our students during all four years. Since its inception in 1996 the Stonehill Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Program has involved 325 students working alongside professors to conduct publish and present research in a broad range of disciplines from biochemistry to education. ATHLETICS MEET ACADEMICS: Stonehill ranks #2 in NCAA Division II academic/athletic colleges in the country according to the National Collegiate Scouting Association as well as ranking consistently at the top level across all three NCAA Divisions including powerhouses such as Duke Stanford and Notre Dame. Over 50% of students involved in athletic programs achieve GPAs of 3.2 or higher; the average GPA of all 400+ current student-athletes is 3.1. CHARACTER AND VALUES: As a Catholic college Stonehill has a strong commitment to community service. Each year approximately 1600 Stonehill students participate in volunteer outreach. Last year our students provided more than 41000 hours of service to numerous nonprofit and civic groups. Our significant opportunities for community service this year include ten alternative spring break H.O.P.E. trips for nearly 200 students to sites from Honduras to New Orleans and Tennesse. Since their inception in 1998 more than 700 students have gone on H.O.P.E. trips in the U.S. and abroad. STRONG OUTCOMES: Our students and alumni succeed because the entire college community collaborates to help them develop the knowledge skills and character to meet their professional goals and live lives of purpose and integrity. Of a recent Stonehill graduating class 92% were employed within one year of graduation at corporations like Goldman Sachs and Brigham and Women's Hospital 38% attended medical law or other graduate programs at institutions like Georgetown and Brown and 8% joined or applied for a year-long volunteer service program such as the Peace Corps and Teach for America.

Scholarship In Action stresses the importance of interactive programs , where faculty and students learn , discover , and create through engagement together and with practitioners , the broader community , and the world. In addition to a large selection of majors , students can select dual majors , minors , or individualized majors with assistance from an academic advisor. In virtually every aspect of student life at Syracuse , choices abound.

As a Catholic and Jesuit university , it is rooted in a world view that encounters God in all creation and through all human activity , especially in the search for truth in every discipline , in the desire to learn , and in the call to live justly together. In this spirit , the University regards the contribution of different religious traditions and value systems as essential to the fullness of its intellectual life and to the continuous development of its distinctive intellectual heritage. Strengthened by more than a century and a quarter of dedication to excellence , Boston College commits itself to the highest standards of teaching and research in undergraduate , graduate , and professional programs and to the pursuit of a just society through its own accomplishments , the work of its faculty and staff , and the achievements of its graduates. It seeks both to advance its place among the nation's finest universities and to bring to the company of its distinguished peers and to the contemporary society the richness of the Catholic intellectual ideal of a mutually illuminating relationship between religious faith and free intellectual inquiry. Boston College pursues this distinctive mission by serving society in three ways : by fostering the rigorous intellectual development and the religious , ethical , and personal formation of its undergraduate , graduate , and professional students in order to prepare them for citizenship , service and leadership in global society ; by producing nationally and internationally significant research that advances insight and understanding , thereby both enriching culture and addressing important societal needs ; and by committing itself to advance the dialogue between religious belief and other formative elements of culture through the intellectual inquiry , teaching and learning , and the community life that form the University. Boston College fulfills this mission with deep concern for all members of its community , with a recognition of the important contribution a diverse student body , faculty and staff can offer , with a firm commitment to academic freedom , and with a determination to exercise careful stewardship of its resources in pursuit of its academic goals.</DIV></DIV>

That means caring more about the questions than giving the right answers , discovering you are good at something you did not think was your strength and making connections where none appear to exist. Bowdoin's curriculum offers a bold blueprint for liberal education designed to inspire students to become world citizens with acute sensitivity to the social and natural world. Its interdisciplinary focus encourages students to make connections among subjects , discover disciplines that excite their imaginations and develop keen skills for addressing the challenges of a changing world. A Bowdoin education is best summed up by "The Offer of the College" : To be at home in all lands and all ages ; To count Nature a familiar acquaintance , And Art an intimate friend ; To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work , And the criticism of your own ; To carry the keys of the world's library in your pocket , And feel its resources behind you in whatever task you undertake ; To make hosts of friends ... Who are to be leaders in all walks of life ; To lose yourself in generous enthusiasms , And cooperate with others for common ends. This is the offer of the college for the best four years of your life. -- Adapted from the original "Offer of the College" by William DeWitt Hyde , President of Bowdoin College , 1885 - 1917.</DIV></DIV>

Nearly 90 percent of undergraduates live on campus in traditional residence halls substance-free housing or small house communities among other options. With more than 150 clubs and organizations on campus students can participate in a wide range of activities. There is sizable Greek community on campus comprising more than half of sophomores juniors and seniors. The Bucknell Bison as the school’s athletic teams are called field more than 25 varsity teams in the NCAA Division I Patriot League. Bucknell’s athletic facilities include an Olympic-sized pool 18-hole golf course and state-of-the-art fitness center.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">With academic programs in the arts , engineering , humanities , management , and social and natural sciences , and broad opportunities outside of class , Bucknell prepares students for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected global society. The University's 3 , 500 undergraduates can choose from more than 50 majors and 60 minors. Students can build robots , write and perform in their own plays or debate solutions to the crisis in Sudan. Engineers can make art , artists can analyze DNA and philosophers can make music. Each student chooses his or her own pathway , but what unites everyone is a shared passion for learning and a desire to achieve deeper levels of understanding about life and the world. Bucknell's faculty creates an environment of free - flowing ideas and stimulating discussions. Professors ( not graduate students ) teach every class , getting to know students personally and challenging them to do their best. The professors are also dedicated scholars who frequently receive awards and grants for their work. Often , they engage students in research and creative projects outside of class. By doing so , they provide students with mentorship and guidance for the future. Outside of class , students participate in myriad activities. Bucknell offers Division I athletics and competes in the Patriot League. Intramural and club sports are also available , along with active Greek life programs and more than 150 student - run clubs and organizations. These organizations focus on anything from social and environmental causes to cultural awareness , poetry slams , dance , pottery or politics. Students can enrich their religious and spiritual lives through multiple University and student - led faith organizations. Bucknell requires nearly all of its undergraduates to live on campus. Living on campus does not , however , mean students are isolated from the real world. Quite the opposite is true. Visiting scholars and speakers come to Bucknell nearly every week , and much of the curriculum focuses on cultures , societies and economies around the globe. Learning happens off campus , too. Students frequently perform service work in places as close as the local nursing home and as far away as Surinam and Uganda. They secure summer internships with nonprofit organizations and corporations. They study abroad through one of the University's own programs or 130 other approved programs in Africa , Asia , Europe and South America. And after they graduate , Bucknellians live and work all over the world. Alumni of Bucknell succeed in their careers because they offer the combination of skills , knowledge and flexibility of mind which employers seek. To prepare students , the University offers career services including advising , networking , mock interviews , internship and externship support , and employer fairs to students beginning in the first year. The placement rate is consistently high : 93 percent of the Class of 2008 was employed or in graduate school within nine months of graduation.</DIV></DIV>

As we embark on becoming the state's next national research university the opportunities for students could not be greater.

We are proud to be one of the leading institutions in Texas vying for Tier One research status with the help of a $425 million National Research University Fund approved by voters in November. 

We are also educating more students than ever as we posted record enrollments for the past two years; last fall more than 30000 students attended classes - the most in school history - and we anticipate breaking that record again this fall as both our undergraduate and graduate numbers continue to grow.

Yet despite this growth Texas Tech has retained the feel of a cozy liberal arts institution. Our students enjoy one-on-one interactions with faculty in a safe and traditional campus atmosphere that offers all the benefits of a major research university.

For example in the past year Texas Tech's faculty and students chased tornadoes across the Midwest as part of the nation's biggest meteorological manhunt. They pinpointed the meteorite that may have killed the dinosaurs and played a role in powering up the world's largest particle collider deep beneath the Swiss Alps.

Meanwhile Texas Tech is one of only three public universities in Texas to boast a chapter of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Our chapter received the society's highest possible rating for 2008-2009 and is in consideration for the Exemplary Chapter Award that Phi Beta Kappa will present to three schools in 2012.

Established in 1923 Texas Tech sits on a 1840-acre campus that features expansive lawns impressive landscaping and Spanish Renaissance-style architecture. It is located in Lubbock Texas - a thriving city of more than 218000 people that is the economic and medical hub of a 26-county region larger than most states. 

The university offers more than 150 bachelor's degrees 100 master's degrees and 50 doctoral degree choices.  Plus as part of the Texas Tech University System Texas Tech shares the same campus with its sister university the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The close proximity makes Texas Tech the only institution in the state with undergraduate and graduate schools a law school and medical school all on the same campus which facilitates the transition to professional studies. 

Worried about getting swallowed up in the crowd? Don't. Lubbock is large enough to offer many of the same shopping dining and opportunities you'd find in larger Texas cities such as Dallas or Houston yet has a friendly and college-focused atmosphere that will make you feel welcome to become a part of the community.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Texas Tech University is in the midst of the most exciting time in the school's history. As we embark on becoming the state's next national research university , the opportunities for students could not be greater. We are proud to be one of the leading institutions in Texas vying for Tier One research status with the help of a $425 million National Research University Fund approved by voters in November. We are also educating more students than ever , as we posted record enrollments for the past two years ; last fall more than 30 , 000 students attended classes - the most in school history - and we anticipate breaking that record again this fall as both our undergraduate and graduate numbers continue to grow. Yet despite this growth , Texas Tech has retained the feel of a cozy liberal arts institution. Our students enjoy one - on - one interactions with faculty in a safe and traditional campus atmosphere that offers all the benefits of a major research university. For example , in the past year , Texas Tech's faculty and students chased tornadoes across the Midwest as part of the nation's biggest meteorological manhunt. They pinpointed the meteorite that may have killed the dinosaurs , and played a role in powering up the world's largest particle collider deep beneath the Swiss Alps. Meanwhile , Texas Tech is one of only three public universities in Texas to boast a chapter of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Our chapter received the society's highest possible rating for 2008 - 2009 and is in consideration for the Exemplary Chapter Award that Phi Beta Kappa will present to three schools in 2012. Established in 1923 , Texas Tech sits on a 1 , 840 - acre campus that features expansive lawns , impressive landscaping and Spanish Renaissance - style architecture. It is located in Lubbock , Texas - a thriving city of more than 218 , 000 people that is the economic and medical hub of a 26 - county region larger than most states.

For sixty - five years , young men and women have come to Kings Point to acquire the knowledge , experience , discipline , and skills that strong leadership demands. As one of the five federal academies , the route to Kings Point is challenging , and will not be easy. However , it will be a rewarding challenge , and will ensure a lifetime of personal and professional satisfaction. Graduates of the Academy serve their country by pursuing careers in the maritime industry and the armed services. Many continue their studies in graduate or professional schools. Many become outstanding government and business leaders. The direction you take after you graduate will be up to you. However , two things are certain : You'll have choices and you'll be prepared to make the most of them. A glimpse at a map of the world confirms that the United States is a maritime nation. To the east is the Atlantic Ocean ; to the west , the Pacific ; off our southern border , the Gulf of Mexico ; in the north , the Great Lakes ; and crisscrossing our states , great rivers like the Mississippi and other inland waterways. Every hour of every day , ships of all types ply the waters in and around our nation. They leave our ports laden with U.S. goods bound for foreign markets , or arrive in our harbors with merchandise and materials for American consumers. Tankers along the west coast with raw petroleum for our refineries ; massive gas carriers bound for terminals along the Gulf coast ; Great Lakes vessels load iron ore , coal or other minerals for America's industry ; huge containerships discharge in Eastern ports , their box - like containers filled with manufactured goods ; general cargo ships in the Gulf unload pallets of coffee and crates of fruit ; tugboats and towboats push and pull barges loaded with Midwest grain. These kinds of vessels , owned by U.S. companies , registered and operated under the American flag , comprise the U.S. merchant marine. This fleet of highly productive ships is a major part of our system of commerce , helping guarantee our access to foreign markets for sale of our manufactured goods. In time of war or national emergency , the U.S. merchant marine becomes vital to national security as a "fourth arm of defense." Our merchant ships bear the brunt of delivering military supplies overseas to our forces and allies. The stark lessons of twentieth century conflict prove that a strong merchant marine is an essential part of American seapower. The nation's economic and security needs met by the U.S. merchant marine are compelling. Today , the United States imports approximately 85 percent of some 77 strategic commodities critical to America's industry and defense. Although we , as a nation , account for only six percent of the world population , we purchase nearly a third of the world's output of raw materials. 99 percent of these materials are transported by merchant vessels. A ship at sea does not operate in a vacuum. It depends on a framework of shoreside activities for its operations. This industry includes companies which own and manage the vessels ; ports and terminals where cargo is handled ; yards for ship repair ; services like marine insurance underwriters , ship chartering firms , admiralty lawyers , engineering and research companies ; and increasingly today , intermodal systems of trucks and railroads to distribute goods around the country. But the most important element in a productive merchant fleet and a strong transportation industry is people - men and women who are intelligent , dedicated , well - educated and competent. The purpose of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is to ensure that such people are available to the nation as shipboard officers and as leaders in the transportation field who will meet the challenges of the present and the future.</DIV></DIV>

Specific developmental goals are addressed through several fully coordinated and integrated programs. A challenging Academic Program that consists of a core of 31 courses provides a balanced education in the arts and sciences. This core curriculum establishes the foundation for elective courses that permit cadets to explore in greater depth a field of study or an optional major. All cadets receive a Bachelor of Science degree , which is designed specifically to meet the intellectual requirements of a commissioned officer in today's Army. The Physical Program at West Point includes both physical education classes and competitive athletics. Every cadet participates in an intercollegiate , club or intramural level sport each semester. This rigorous physical program contributes to the mental and physical fitness that is required for service as an officer in the Army. Cadets learn basic military skills , including leadership , through a demanding Military Program , which begins on their first day at West Point. Most military training takes place during the summer , with new cadets undergoing Cadet Basic Training - or Beast Barracks - the first year , followed by Cadet Field Training at nearby Camp Buckner the second year. Cadets spend their third and fourth summers serving in active Army units around the world ; attending advanced training courses such as airborne , air assault or northern warfare ; or training the first and second year cadets as members of the leadership cadre. Military training is combined with military science instruction to provide a solid military foundation for officership. Moral - ethical development occurs throughout the formal programs as well as a host of activities and experiences available at the Military Academy. These include formal instruction in the important values of the military profession , voluntary religious programs , interaction with staff and faculty role models , and a vigorous guest speaker program. The foundation of the ethical code at West Point is found in the Academy's motto , "Duty , Honor , Country." Cadets also develop ethically by adhering to the Cadet Honor Code , which states , "A cadet will not lie , cheat or steal , or tolerate those who do." The life of a cadet is demanding , but leisure time does permit recreational activities such as golf , skiing , sailing , and ice - skating , Intramural clubs include a cadet radio station , orienteering , rock climbing , and Big Brother - Big Sister. A wide variety of religious activities are available to cadets from virtually all religious backgrounds.</DIV></DIV>

The setting and the diversity of our students and faculty foster unique advantages in the study of Asian and Pacific cultures foreign languages tropical agriculture tropical medicine ocean and marine sciences astronomy volcanology and international business.

Our unique geographical cultural and historical heritage suggests that the University of Hawai`i at Manoa values and the responsibilities inherent in embracing those values include the following:

A focus on developing an awareness of and sensitivity to diversity and commonality. The Manoa campus is culturally rich and complex providing a perfect social setting for frequent interactions with persons from
cultures other than one's own. At Manoa we incorporate and celebrate intercultural experiences and understanding into our social and educational environments in a comprehensive fashion. Manoa is also a place where historic political economic and social conflicts between Native Hawaiian people settlers and working immigrants have contributed to the diverse perspectives beliefs values and even conceptual frameworks of our islands' people. Growing out of the core Hawaiian value of aloha an essential component of the Manoa Experience are insights that both bond us and simultaneously express the variations that collectively enrich us.

A focus on global awareness and local responsibility. These values are consistent with a uniquely Hawaiian place of learning. Hawai`i is a place where the strength of identity is important to Native Hawaiian people
struggling to maintain traditional connections while establishing new global relationships. Their struggle for cultural distinction forms a significant part of the story of human history and change. Hawai`i is also a place
where the peoples from Asia Europe and the Pacific regions gathered formed communities and built lives together. The pluri-cultural children of Hawai`i are global citizens a true pan-ethnic population. Hence we attempt to 
infuse our pedagogical social and cultural environments with a global perspective and with questions and issues of global significance. Moreover engaging and acting upon local questions and issues during their
educational experience at Manoa engenders in students a sense of responsibility toward future generations.

The setting and the diversity of our students and faculty foster unique advantages in the study of Asian and Pacific cultures , foreign languages , tropical agriculture , tropical medicine , ocean and marine sciences , astronomy , volcanology , and international business. Our unique geographical , cultural , and historical heritage suggests that the University of Hawai`i at Manoa values and the responsibilities inherent in embracing those values include the following : A focus on developing an awareness of and sensitivity to diversity and commonality. The Manoa campus is culturally rich and complex , providing a perfect social setting for frequent interactions with persons from cultures other than one's own. At Manoa we incorporate and celebrate intercultural experiences and understanding into our social and educational environments in a comprehensive fashion. Manoa is also a place where historic political , economic and social conflicts between Native Hawaiian people , settlers and working immigrants have contributed to the diverse perspectives , beliefs , values and even conceptual frameworks of our islands' people. Growing out of the core Hawaiian value of aloha , an essential component of the Manoa Experience , are insights that both bond us and simultaneously express the variations that collectively enrich us. A focus on global awareness and local responsibility. These values are consistent with a uniquely Hawaiian place of learning. Hawai`i is a place where the strength of identity is important to Native Hawaiian people struggling to maintain traditional connections while establishing new global relationships. Their struggle for cultural distinction forms a significant part of the story of human history and change. Hawai`i is also a place where the peoples from Asia , Europe , and the Pacific regions gathered , formed communities , and built lives together. The pluri - cultural children of Hawai`i are global citizens , a true pan - ethnic population. Hence , we attempt to infuse our pedagogical , social , and cultural environments with a global perspective and with questions and issues of global significance. Moreover , engaging and acting upon local questions and issues during their educational experience at Manoa engenders in students a sense of responsibility toward future generations. A focus on sustainability and renewability. These values are also a reflection of our unique Hawaiian cultural history , as voiced in the Hawaiian core value of malama i ka aina , malama i ke kai ( caring for the land and sea that sustain us ) .

Students at UofL are presented a wide range of study options - more than 170 fields in 11 schools and colleges - with many nationally ranked programs among them. UofL's location is also an asset giving students many opportunities to apply the critical thinking skills they hone in the classroom to relevant hands-on experiences in the community. UofL students benefit from superb facilities including a library system ranked among the top 100 research libraries in North America and one of the nation's top clean rooms where work in bioengineering nanotechnology and other high-demand fields occurs. UofL is committed to building a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate a respect for diversity and a genuine understanding of how diversity enriches a vibrant metropolitan research university. This includes international experience too. One of the university's goals is to give every arts and sciences student the chance to study abroad at least once during his or her undergraduate career.

Among other things UofL faculty conducted the world's first successful implantation of a fully implantable artificial heart developed the world's first effective cervical cancer vaccine and completed the nation's first successful hand transplant. Another factor that makes UofL stand out is community service. The university's curricular engagement outreach and partnerships recently earned it a Carnegie Community Engagement ranking a designation held by fewer than 200 institutions nationwide. In one year alone UofL students faculty and staff contributed more than $25.1 million to charitable organizations through volunteerism and direct donations. Among the university's many outreach programs is the Signature Partnership working with community organizations and businesses to improve the social cultural educational health care and economic development services in a historically underserved area of Louisville. UofL was environmentally minded long before "green" became a buzzword co-founding the Partnership for a Green City several years ago with the city and public school system to team up on reducing waste increasing energy efficiency and improving the health and education of area children. UofL is a major player in the downtown arts scene too helping bring fine arts programming to Louisville to create a more vibrant city center.

University of Richmond students can go white water rafting on the nearby James River or can stop by some of the city’s many events throughout the year such as  the Richmond Folk Festival and the Richmond Greek Festival. There are a handful of popular music venues downtown as well as scores of restaurants bars and clubs. On the University of Richmond campus one-third of the student body is involved in the Greek system comprising about 15 fraternities and sororities. If Greek life isn’t your thing there are more than 250 other student clubs and organizations to check out too. First-year students must live on campus and can elect to live in specialty housing programs. The all-male RC Xtreme group is ideal for freshmen who want to go on weekend adventure trips with their floormates and female students can live and learn through programs like Ready for Moore a residence hall community aimed at enhancing leadership skills. Campus housing is a popular option for students of all years as more than 90 percent of undergraduates choose to live in residence halls. The University of Richmond is the only school in the country to use a spider as its unique mascot and all Spiders athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference except for football and women’s golf. Those teams are members of the Colonial Athletic Association. Student fans in the Richmond Rowdies spirit club cheer on the athletes—especially the competitive Spider basketball and football teams. The university offers 75 study abroad programs and more than half of all students take part in a global opportunity before graduation.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">The University of Richmond provides a learning environment unlike any other in higher education , offering students an extraordinary combination of traditional strengths in the liberal arts with law , business , leadership studies , and continuing education.

The Yellowjackets are part of the University Athletic Association and participate in NCAA Division III sports. The school also offers more than 200 student organizations and about one quarter of students are affiliated with Greek life on campus. Rochester’s a cappella ensembles are among the country’s best. Freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus and two-thirds of the juniors and more than half of the seniors choose to remain on campus. Rochester’s main campus is located two miles south of downtown Rochester N.Y. in the bend of the Genesee River.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Excellence requires freedom. The University of Rochester's belief in this fundamental principle , which drives research faculty around the world , has led to our unique and innovative Rochester Curriculum. Living the principle straight out of high school , Rochester students are free to select the courses that appeal to them most from their first day on campus. Advising is thus also highly individualized from the first day , and Rochester students typically discover a passion ( or combination of passions ) at an early point in their BS or BA career. The Rochester Curriculum commitment means there are zero required subjects ; instead , students' interests drive their education. As they structure their choices , students will eventually choose to major in one of 65 degree programs in sciences and engineering , humanities , or social sciences , and complete a "cluster" of at least three related courses in each of the other two areas. Among America's advanced research universities , Rochester is the most collegiate in character , with smaller enrollment overall and a commitment that 95 - 100% of every student's course instruction will be from a tenure - track faculty member. With guaranteed exposure to research faculty , Rochester students undertake advanced studies and research in graduate courses early in their undergraduate career in arts and sciences or in any one of Rochester's nationally ranked schools of engineering , medicine , nursing , music , education , and business. Not surprisingly , the share of Rochester students who ultimately choose to pursue graduate degrees themselves is among the nation's highest. In other important respects Rochester mirrors the best that small universities or liberal arts colleges can offer. The campus is residential and self - contained , but an exciting small city downtown is two miles away , and year - round recreation is prominent in all directions. Recreation , schools , and culture are among the reasons Rochester was ranked in Places Rated Almanac 2007 as the 6th most ideal among America's 395 metropolitan areas. The Curriculum drives an enormous diversity for life on campus , which supports nearly 250 different student organizations. Since no two academic programs are alike , students tend to be individuals whose confidence grows during their four years. Rochester students often seem to emulate the faculty , who have devoted their lives to free academic inquiry. The students believe that they can make intelligent choices for themselves and tend to associate in ways that reinforce support for every other student's individual choices.</DIV></DIV>

Exposing students to experiences and educational opportunities that best prepare them for working in a global marketplace is a primary focus. 

UT enrolled 27739 total students for the 2008-09 academic year with a freshmen class of 4215. The 2008-09 freshmen had an average GPA of 3.65 with an average ACT score of 27. ACT scores have risen steadily since the Tennessee Hope lottery-funded scholarship began in 2004. About 99 percent of the in-state freshman class qualify for the Hope Scholarship which provides $4000 per year. Forty percent of that same class receives some additional need- or merit-based aid. 

The University has created three need-based scholarship and grant programs to allow greater access to all academically qualified Tennessee students. The Tennessee Pledge Scholarship program covers tuition fees and room and board for eligible low-income students. The Tennessee Promise Scholarship program provides scholarships to students from select state high schools that traditionally have not sent many students to UT. Next fall a new admissions initiative called Achieve the Dream program will make grant money available to help students from lower middle-income families. 

Fifteen of the nation's top students will enter UT in the fall of 2009 as the second class of Haslam Scholars a preeminent honors program that includes a study-abroad opportunity and up to $5500 for a senior research thesis. Additionally in recent years UT Knoxville has enrolled three Goldwater Scholars one Goldwater Honorable Mention a Fulbright scholar and a Udall Scholar. 

UT's long-range program "Ready for the World" continues to help students gain the international and intercultural knowledge they need to succeed in today's world. The effort has enriched campus multicultural programming and has provided new scholarships and study-abroad opportunities.

Graduate and undergraduate education are both enhanced by UT's partnership with Battelle to manage nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. That relationship helps UT recruit top scientists and offer first-rate internships and research opportunities.

UT Knoxville's faculty has an impressive list of honors in the past few years: For 2009 those include a Fulbright Scholar A Guggenheim Fellow and two NEH fellows. UT Knoxville is tied with the University of Virginia with the sixth most NEH fellows in the U.S. over the past five years.

Our commitment to traditional values is reflected by our undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation for a deeper understanding of advanced studies.  Cumberland graduates enjoy a high acceptance rate to graduate and professional schools.  Within five years of graduation 66% of our alums have completed or are pursuing a graduate or professional degree.  Of course one of the major reasons for the success of our students is that we require more than just academic success for their degree.  We also require that each student help his/her fellowman by volunteering a minimum of 40 hours of community service hours before graduation.  The Leadership and Community Service Program helps us to fulfill our mission of preparing students for lives of ethical and responsible leadership. Through this program students gain practical hands-on experience working with established service organizations and designing and implementing community service projects.

Our commitment to traditional values is reflected by our undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation for a deeper understanding of advanced studies. Cumberland graduates enjoy a high acceptance rate to graduate and professional schools. Within five years of graduation , 66% of our alums have completed or are pursuing a graduate or professional degree. Of course , one of the major reasons for the success of our students is that we require more than just academic success for their degree. We also require that each student help his / her fellowman by volunteering a minimum of 40 hours of community service hours before graduation. The Leadership and Community Service Program helps us to fulfill our mission of preparing students for lives of ethical and responsible leadership. Through this program , students gain practical hands - on experience working with established service organizations and designing and implementing community service projects.

The college does not have a core curriculum and students can declare a major by concentrating in a department , an interdepartmental program , a multidisciplinary program , or an individually tailored field of study in the Independent Program. This intellectual freedom produces original thinkers and has shaped the very essence of Vassar's academic life. In fact , the encouragement of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary studies has distinguished Vassar academics at least as far back as the early 1900s -- when the college began offering interdepartmental courses -- and the wide - ranging exchange of ideas has steadily inspired an array of new courses , programs , and resources. Vassar now boasts a dozen multidisciplinary and interdepartmental programs ranging from Latin American and Latino / a Studies to Environmental Studies and Cognitive Science , the latter for which Vassar was the first college or university to offer a bachelor's degree ( 1982 ) . The college's oldest such program , Africana Studies , celebrated its fortieth anniversary in 2009 , and Media Studies became the newest of these programs in 2004. As a result , Vassar's curriculum is broader , richer , and more varied than ever , now offering students a choice among 29 departments , 6 interdisciplinary programs , 12 multidisciplinary programs , 51 majors , and over 1 , 000 courses.</DIV></DIV>

Students admitted to the college are known as military cadets and are required to participate in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). Unlike the federal service academies Virginia Military Institute cadets are not required to serve in the military upon graduation. Cadets have about 80 academic professional and social clubs and organizations to choose from upon entering the college. Freshmen admitted to the Institute are immediately exposed to the Ratline which is a system designed to remove wealth and former status in life to create equality among all cadets. This is done through a series of team-building exercises as well as with the assistance of upperclassmen. The housing situation is much different from most universities’ campuses. Known as the Barracks cadets live modestly with limited space and multiple occupants and are expected to maintain cleanliness and order at all times. The Virginia Military Institute Keydets fields 14 NCAADivision I athletic programs and is a member of the Big South Conference Southern Conference and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">VMI is a challenging curricular and co - curricular undergraduate experience , producing educated and honorable men and women who will be leaders in all walks of life.

More than 85% of seniors seeking employment find work in their fields or admission to graduate school before graduation.

W&J offers students a personalized learning experience with more than 70% of classes having fewer than 20 students. With a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio professors hold classes in their homes help students develop advanced research agendas and attend athletic events to cheer them on.  In addition numerous alumni around the world offer students networking opportunities in nearly every discipline.

The result is student achievement of the highest caliber. Our students land research internships at The Pasteur Institute The Mayo Clinic and Los Alamos Labs to name a few. W&J challenges our students by sending them to national meetings where their research is presented alongside that of professional researchers graduate students and faculty from other institutions. 

More than half of our students take advantage of more than 40 study abroad programs in countries such as Australia China France Germany Spain and South Africa. W&J students put their liberal arts educations to work testing their professional aspirations in the real world while becoming global citizens.

The Intersession term a distinctive feature of our 4-1-4 academic calendar allows students to take one course intensively during the month of January. They may travel to London to study theatre camp out in Africa to watch animals migrate or stay on campus to design robots or study with a prize-winning journalist.

W&J students study hard but they are also active outside of the classroom. Almost 30% of students belong to Greek organizations. With close proximity to Pittsburgh W&J students can easily travel into the city on college-run vans to see professional sports events shop eat in fine restaurants attend theatre or ballet performances or listen to renowned speakers.  

W&J was honored with the President's Honor Roll for Community Service with Distinction; students volunteer more than 15000 hours a year in service to our community. They raise money for cancer research volunteer at the Humane Society read to first graders and to the blind and help staff the Washington Women's Shelter. 

W&J also has a strong tradition of producing student-athletes. The College fields 24 intercollegiate sports and is still the smallest college ever to compete in the Rose Bowl battling California to a zero-zero tie in the 1922 game. Student athletes from W&J include Charlie West the first African-American quarterback in the Rose Bowl game and legendary coaches such as John Heisman. 

With about 12000 living alumni W&J has graduated leaders in almost every field from architecture to zoology. The College boasts civic leaders like James G. Blaine (1847) who served as secretary of state and ran for president three times; as well as pioneers such as Joseph Walker who made the first NASA x-15 flight and was the first to pilot the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle; and Jesse Lazear who studied yellow fever in Cuba with Walter Reed. W&J also educated NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell '81 and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl '03 the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city in the United States.

Students and graduates alike are experiencing incredible success in a variety of fields inside and outside the classroom and the John A. Swanson Science Center as expected opened in early 2010.

With a 12 : 1 student - to - faculty ratio , professors hold classes in their homes , help students develop advanced research agendas , and attend athletic events to cheer them on. In addition , numerous alumni around the world offer students networking opportunities in nearly every discipline. The result is student achievement of the highest caliber. Our students land research internships at The Pasteur Institute , The Mayo Clinic , and Los Alamos Labs , to name a few. W&J challenges our students by sending them to national meetings where their research is presented alongside that of professional researchers , graduate students , and faculty from other institutions. More than half of our students take advantage of more than 40 study abroad programs in countries such as Australia , China , France , Germany , Spain , and South Africa. W&J students put their liberal arts educations to work , testing their professional aspirations in the real world while becoming global citizens. The Intersession term , a distinctive feature of our 4 - 1 - 4 academic calendar , allows students to take one course , intensively , during the month of January. They may travel to London to study theatre , camp out in Africa to watch animals migrate , or stay on campus to design robots or study with a prize - winning journalist. W&J students study hard , but they are also active outside of the classroom. Almost 30% of students belong to Greek organizations. With close proximity to Pittsburgh , W&J students can easily travel into the city on college - run vans to see professional sports events , shop , eat in fine restaurants , attend theatre or ballet performances , or listen to renowned speakers. W&J was honored with the President's Honor Roll for Community Service with Distinction ; students volunteer more than 15 , 000 hours a year in service to our community. They raise money for cancer research , volunteer at the Humane Society , read to first graders and to the blind , and help staff the Washington Women's Shelter. W&J also has a strong tradition of producing student - athletes. The College fields 24 intercollegiate sports and is still the smallest college ever to compete in the Rose Bowl , battling California to a zero - zero tie in the 1922 game. Student athletes from W&J include Charlie West , the first African - American quarterback in the Rose Bowl game , and legendary coaches such as John Heisman. With about 12 , 000 living alumni , W&J has graduated leaders in almost every field , from architecture to zoology. The College boasts civic leaders like James G. Blaine ( 1847 ), who served as secretary of state and ran for president three times ; as well as pioneers such as Joseph Walker , who made the first NASA x - 15 flight and was the first to pilot the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle ; and Jesse Lazear , who studied yellow fever in Cuba with Walter Reed. W&J also educated NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell '81 and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl '03 , the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city in the United States. Students and graduates alike are experiencing incredible success in a variety of fields inside and outside the classroom , and the John A. Swanson Science Center , as expected , opened in early 2010. W&J is a college on the move , looking to the future with great optimism while building on its historical past.</DIV></DIV>

True to its heritage Wells maintains a national reputation for academic excellence. The College prides itself on offering one of the most collaborative learning environments in higher education today.

This is not your ordinary education.  The Wells experience is deeply personal and intensely focused on superior academic achievement.  Wells offers 23 majors and over 40 minors. With one professor for every ten students professors really get to know everyone.  The average class size has fourteen students and is taught seminar-style with discussions taking precedence over lectures.  

Since 1868 we've been encouraging our students to step outside the classroom.  Why?  Because the best education combines traditional studies with real-world experiences.  Last year the Wells Office of Career Services coordinated internships in twenty states the District of Columbia France and Senegal.  By graduation 97% of seniors had completed at least one internship.  Your education won't stop at the edge of campus.  Recent internships include: The White House ABC Television Aquarium of the Pacific Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum Smithsonian Institution and many more.  

Wells also offers an extensive study abroad program with affiliated programs in 13 different countries.  Our staff will help you pursue your academic interests wherever they lead you.  You might study ecosystems in Australia's Outback or work in labs film studios or research hospitals anywhere in the world.  Although the two most popular programs are in Florence and Paris you could study almost anywhere.

The Wells experience is deeply personal and intensely focused on superior academic achievement. Wells offers 23 majors and over 40 minors. With one professor for every ten students , professors really get to know everyone. The average class size has fourteen students and is taught seminar - style , with discussions taking precedence over lectures. Since 1868 we've been encouraging our students to step outside the classroom. Why? Because the best education combines traditional studies with real - world experiences.

By graduation , 97% of seniors had completed at least one internship. Your education won't stop at the edge of campus.

In 2008 WCU adopted a new quality enhancement plan as part of its successful effort to earn re-accreditation from the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges. The plan is a framework for helping students become engaged and intentional in their own educations by encouraging them to reflect on how their classroom experience connects to what they learn outside the classroom and how everything in their university experience connects to their career and life goals. SACS reviewers expressed enthusiastic approval for the plan and urged the university to move forward with it. At the same time faculty adopted a new tenure policy that rewards professors for using their scholarly expertise to address the needs of the region. The policy adds a new dimension to the traditional evaluation of faculty on the quality of their teaching and research. In response to increased student enrollment and changes in academic programs the university was restructured creating a new College of Fine and Performing Arts and a new College of Health and Human Sciences.

The ???Academy??? Advantage
Academies are generally small focused structured and offer a high-quality education.  These characteristics all describe Cal Maritime.

Our reputation among the many corporations industries agencies and graduate schools filled with Cal Maritime alumni is that of a school preparing professional responsible and successful graduates

The Value of a CSU Campus plus the Quality of a Private College
As one of the 23 campuses in the California State University (CSU) system Cal Maritime enjoys the strength associated with this planet???s biggest university system.  Tuition and housing costs are no more than other CSU campuses up and down the state which makes us highly affordable. Our academic quality however shares more in common with private colleges. Our average class size of 23 student as well as approachable mentoring faculty creates an academic atmosphere

The Corps of Cadets Stressing Responsibility Accountability Leadership and Professionalism
At Cal Maritime all students are also cadets who comprise the Corps of Cadets that forms the basic organizational structure of the Academy.  Your classes will teach you the ???hard??? skills and knowledge for your degree but the Corps of Cadets stresses the ???soft??? skills such as responsibility accountability leadership and professionalism.

All Cal Maritime cadets become members of the crew of the 500 foot Training Ship GOLDEN BEAR on at least one sixty day journey visiting a number of ports around the Pacific Rim.  The cadets run the ship (including the bridge and engine room) under the supervision of licensed maritime professionals. Cadets also take classes perform ship maintenance and gain a first-hand exposure to ship operations.

International Travel for All
One important way that Cal Maritime supports ensures a global perspective in its graduates is the required GOLDEN BEAR experience.  With each voyage visiting three or four international ports 100% of our cadets travel abroad ??? learning about world travel related to their intended careers and soaking up local culture.  Many students also participate in port field trips to gain exposure to the how business and international affairs are conducted in distant parts of the world.

All Students have a Paid Summer Internship

Its location on California’s Central Coast allows for activities such as surfing rock climbing and dune riding among others. Cal Poly provides housing in its residence halls to about 3500 students but many students choose to live off campus. The Cal Poly Mustangs have approximately 20 NCAA Division I athletic teams and are well known for their strong women’s volleyball and men’s soccer programs. Greek life is prominent on campus with nearly 40 fraternity and sorority chapters. The Cal Poly chapter of Engineers Without Borders enables students to complete engineering projects in disadvantaged communities around the world.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">As a predominantly undergraduate university serving California , the mission of Cal Poly is to discover , integrate , articulate and apply knowledge. This it does by emphasizing teaching ; engaging in research ; participating in the various communities ( local , state , and international ) with which it pursues common interests ; and where appropriate , providing students with the unique experience of direct involvement with the actual challenges of their disciplines in the United States and abroad. Cal Poly undergraduate students identify with their major from the beginning of their Cal Poly career. Students select majors at the time they apply for admission , and they take courses in their major starting in their first year. This gives them a chance to decide early if they have chosen a field that is appropriate to their interests and abilities. It also helps students associate with faculty and other students in their field , share common interests , and learn in a supportive atmosphere. Classes emphasize active learning methods and include a high proportion of lab work and field work. Activities both on and off campus provide opportunities to apply what is learned in the classroom. Cal Poly emphasizes a complete education that teaches students to think logically , evaluate critically , and communicate clearly.</DIV></DIV>

This long-standing polytechnic approach makes it unique among traditional universities and has earned Cal Poly Pomona the reputation of developing individuals who are among the most sought after in today's marketplace.

A nationally-recognized public university with a number of highly respected and ranked programs Cal Poly Pomona provides its students an excellent environment for academic personal and professional success.  The U.S. Department of Education U.S. News & World Report Black Issues in Higher Education Design Intelligence Hispanic Outlook Magazine Journal of Hospitality Management Los Angeles Times Business Journal and Project Connect have ranked Cal Poly Pomona in numerous categories.

Cal Poly Pomona is located on the eastern edge of Southern California's San Gabriel Valley.  The site of the university is the former winter ranch of William K. Kellogg the cereal magnate.  The university's 1400-acre campus features lush rolling hills; flowers plants and trees from all seven continents; a rose garden personally built by Kellogg; and a beautifully landscaped Japanese Garden.  The university's aesthetic qualities are one of its best kept secrets.  Some of the world's finest architects and landscape architects designed and built the ranch - a hybrid of architecture which combined the formal courtyards gardens and elements of Spanish Italian and Islamic architecture with the informality of a growing nouveau-riche society.  Pasadena architect Myron Hunt (Rose Bowl Huntington Library) designed Kellogg's main house.  Charles Gibbs Adams whose work included the Hearst Castle Gardens in San Simeon California was selected to landscape the grounds.  Later the landscape was completed by Florence Yoch and Lucille Council widely recognized as two of the finest garden designers and landscape architects in California.  More recently Antoine Predock designed the University's administration building with a desert theme.

The university has a distinguished history with its origin as a private school.  Two national icons Charles B. Voorhis a prominent automotive industry figure and Kellogg contributed to the University's establishment and success.  Voorhis entered the automobile business as a sales manager joining the Oakland Motor Car Company (General Motors) of Pontiac Michigan in 1914 and rose to become vice-president.  In 1917 he helped found the Nash Motors Company with then GM President Charles W. Nash.  In 1928 Voorhis opened the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas California a college for homeless young men which he endowed and served as chairman of the board.  With the help of his son Jerry Voorhis a U. S. Congressman the Voorhis School for Boys became one of the most popular institutions in Southern California.  In 1938 the Voorhis School for Boys became known as the Voorhis Unit of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo when the State of California acquired the private school.  In 1949 the Voorhis Unit acquired Kellogg's winter ranch.

In 1925 Kellogg fulfilled a dream when he moved to Pomona California to start an Arabian horse breeding program the oldest in the United States and the fifth largest in the country today.  More than 70% of the domestic Arabian bloodstock in the U.S. can trace its lineage to the original breeding program.  With the assistance of Richard Nixon and then U.S. President Harry S. Truman Kellogg's desire to have the ranch become an institution of higher education became a reality.  A stipulation in maintaining the property is that the University continues Kellogg's tradition of a Sunday Arabian horse show.  On the first Sunday of the month from October through May students host public performances.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">As one of nine polytechnic universities nationwide , Cal Poly Pomona integrates a learn - by - doing approach into its project and presentation - based coursework.

Known for its academic excellence and welcoming campus community , Carleton offers 37 majors and 16 concentrations in the arts , humanities , natural sciences , and social sciences , with recent additions in Environmental Studies and Cinema and Media Studies. Carleton is committed to providing a true liberal arts education , a curriculum that challenges students to learn broadly and think deeply. Carleton's student body is notoriously difficult to categorize , but one word to describe it might be curious. "Carls" are an intellectually insatiable group that approaches learning with enthusiasm and a uniquely Carleton brand of playfulness. Broad - ranging interests are common , and friendships cross all traditional boundaries. Students and alumni say there's just something different about Carleton. Maybe it's the size ( fewer than 2 , 000 students ) . Or maybe it's the round - the - clock proximity of so many creative minds ( 90 percent of students live on campus ) . Whatever the reason , Carleton is a place where students are likelier to cooperate than compete -- and where working hard doesn't mean forgetting how to play. The College supports more than 100 different student organizations , features a capella vocal groups , comedy troupes , dance groups and several drama groups. The College sponsors 20 varsity sports , 10 for men and 10 for women , with a club and intramural sports scene that sees nearly 90 percent of the student body partake with a wide spectrum of ability level. Carleton's faculty members are highly respected scholars , researchers , and practitioners in their fields. Every course at Carleton is taught by a professor , not a teaching assistant , in classes small enough to offer individual attention. Carleton students come from 49 states and from 30 other countries. Multicultural students account for about 20 percent of Carleton's students. More than half of all students receive need - based financial aid and 70 percent hold jobs on campus. Carleton leads all undergraduate colleges in the number of its students awarded prestigious National Science Foundation Fellowships for graduate study. The College enrolls more National Merit Scholars than any other small liberal arts college , and has had 18 Rhodes Scholars. Community service is an integral part of the Carleton experience , with more than 600 students involved in the campus volunteer organization , Acting in the Community Together ( ACT ) . More than 70 percent of the student population participates in off - campus studies , at locations around the United States and in countries on every continent except Antarctica. Carleton brings national and international guests to campus as visiting faculty or for weekly convocations , which are free and open to the public. Guests have included astronaut Sally Ride , head of news and politics at YouTube and former Carleton student Steve Grove , entrepreneurs Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry's ice cream , New York Times personal health columnist and best - selling author Jane Brody , Lowell Bergman , a producer / correspondent for the PBS documentary series "Frontline" and contributor to investigative reports to The New York Times , and Carleton alumnus Barrie Osborne , Oscar award winning producer of "The Lord of the Rings." Carleton features an 880 - acre Cowling Arboretum ( "the Arb" ) that provides a network of walking , running , and cross - country skiing trails. The Arb was named among the top 10 places to run in the country by Runner's World magazine. The College also has one of the largest undergraduate libraries in the country , as well as two new residence halls , completed in 2009 , and built with LEED Gold standards. Carleton graduates can be found in nearly every professional field. Within five years of graduating , 65 - 70 percent go on to top graduate and professional schools across the nation.</DIV></DIV>

The College places a high value on experiential learning and gives students the opportunity to "live what they learn." Students who complete the College's 38-hour liberal arts core plus three applied learning experiences receive a second major in Applied Critical Thought and Inquiry (ACT-In). As a result all students can graduate with double majors in four years. The ACT-In option is a reflection of the College's philosophy that education must take students beyond thinking and inquiring and to action. Beginning with the entering class in the fall of 2010 every student who successfully completes the sophomore year will be eligible to receive a "Journey Grant" to fund a transformative hands-on experience. Journey Grants can support self-designed research projects study-away opportunities internships civic engagement initiatives or service projects at home or abroad. Students can pool grants together to create substantive collaborative projects.  In addition to ACT-In other distinctive programs are available to Jewell students. The internationally recognized Oxbridge Honors Program supported by the Hall Family Foundation combines British tutorial methods of instruction with a year of study in Oxford or Cambridge.

Situated in the city of Spartanburg S.C. Wofford is situated on 170 tree-lined acres that have been designated as an arboretum. Since 1992 nearly 5000 trees have been planted throughout the campus. Students admitted to the college are given the choice of more than 50 majors and minors as well as numerous student organizations. Greek life is very prevalent on campus with 14 chapters and more than 40 percent of the student body participating in a fraternity or sorority. Though students have the opportunity to live off campus more than 90 percent of the student body decides to live on campus during their college careers. Known as the Terriers Wofford is a member of the Southern Conference in the NCAA Division I and is represented by 18 men’s and women’s varsity programs.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">In the 2010 edition of America's Best Colleges , Wofford is listed among 40 great schools , great prices among the nation's liberal arts colleges. In these challenging economic times , the ability to deliver a world - class product while charging fees and expenses only slightly above the national average is more important than ever. Following is a brief summary of six relatively new , high - value features of the time - tested Phi Beta Kappa education offered at Wofford for almost 160 years. ( 1 ) The college is committed to seeing that a high percentage of its students receive opportunities for study abroad. For years , Wofford has ranked in the top 10 percent of the annual IIE Open Doors survey , with well over 80 percent earning credits overseas. 53 percent of the students selected less commonly chosen destinations and spent a semester in the developing world. ( 2 ) Located in a middle - sized Southern city , Wofford stresses service - learning opportunities in a variety of settings. The college made the 2009 - 2010 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll , published by the Corporation for National and Community Service. For two straight years , Wofford has been listed ???with distinction.??? ONE is a global advocacy and campaigning organization backed by more than 2 million people from around the world dedicated to fighting extreme poverty and preventable disease , particularly in Africa. In 2008 , Wofford's student - led project won the national ONE Campus Challenge that involved 1400 colleges and universities. ( 3 ) The Community of Scholars initiative is a 10 - week summer research program focused on creating cross - disciplinary dialogue. Rather than empowering faculty to recruit paid research associates , Community of Scholars challenges students to design projects and attract an interested faculty sponsor. The goal is to make this approach to research a model for similar liberal arts campuses as well as university schools and colleges. ( 4 ) C. Michael Curtis , fiction editor of the Atlantic Monthly , holds an endowed professorship at Wofford. He continues to have significant influence on students in the creative writing program. Another senior faculty member teaches a class where advanced creative writing students write a novel , and the best effort is published in the Benjamin Wofford novel series. ( 5 ) In the spring of 2010 , Wofford will graduate its first majors in environmental studies , a unique major that combines the natural sciences , social sciences , and literature. The program is headquartered on campus and at the Goodall Environmental Studies Center , a restored mill office building that has been renovated to LEED standards. ( 5 ) Largely through the work of Dr. Ellen Goldey of the department of biology , Wofford is an active participant in SENCER ( Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities ), which stimulates student engagement in science and mathematics through courses and programs focused on real world problems. A dozen or more faculty members have been responsible for developing Wofford's on - going inter - disciplinary learning communities , a first - year highlight for many students. Innovations such as these create an atmosphere of student engagement at Wofford that has resulted in exceptionally high scores on the Collegiate Learning Assessment ( CLA ) and the National Survey of Student Engagement ( NSSE ) . In a follow - up NSSE study , "Project DEEP , " Wofford was featured as one of 20 benchmark campuses for engaged learning in the book , Student Success in College : Creating Conditions That Matter ( American Association for Higher Education , 2005 ) . This study concluded , in part , "By all accounts , Wofford College is an engaging institution that benefits from an enviable level of loyalty and collegiality among students , faculty , administrators and all college employees. In part , this is due to a storied tradition , open communication , leadership continuity , and the college's small size."</DIV></DIV>

Worcester Polytechnic Institute stands out as a close-knit private school grounded in scientific education. The student body is actively engaged in campus activities such as the rivalry contests like the gigantic tug-of-war held throughout the year that pit the freshmen class against the sophomores. More than 30 percent of students are members of the school’s 15 or so fraternities and sororities. Even more—close 70 percent—are involved in campus sports at some level. The WPI Engineers compete in the NCAA Division III New England Men’s and Women’s Athletic Conference supported by mascot Gompei a goat. Though the original school mascot was the head of a once-live goat the school now uses a man-made replica for a mascot. WPI students also come out in droves for the school’s club sports and intramural program and all students must take four physical education courses ranging from lifeguarding to . Freshmen do not have to live in campus residence facilities which include standard dormitories and four houses with student-selected themes. A university seal is imprinted on the ground in the center of campus but make sure not to step on it; school lore warns that any student who does won’t graduate on time. Off campus students can use Woo Cards to get discounts on food and activities around Worcester. Boston is 45 miles away or about an hour’s trip by train.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Founded in 1865 in Worcester , Mass. , WPI was one of the nation's first engineering and technology universities. Today , WPI is a small , independent university centered on engineering , science , technology , and mathematics , with strong academic and co - curricular programs in the arts and humanities , the social sciences , and management. The university's 14 academic departments offer more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs , leading to the BA , BS , MS , ME , MBA and PhD. WPI places a high premium on excellence in undergraduate education , with rich student - faculty interaction and a unique approach to active , collaborative learning through a project - enriched curriculum. Each WPI undergraduate must complete two major projects , the most distinctive of which addresses an open - ended need or problem at the intersection of science , technology and society. Through these projects , which are often sponsored by leaders of major corporations , senior officers in government agencies , and key representatives of professional societies in the U.S. and around the world , students demonstrate their ability to apply what they learn in the classroom to real - world problems , and to gain an appreciation for how the solutions to those problems might impact the world around them. In addition , all students must complete a humanities and arts requirement that culminates in an inquiry seminar or practicum. Through the university's innovative Global Perspective Program , students have the opportunity to make a difference to communities and organizations around the world. WPI established its first off - campus residential project center in 1974 in Washington , D.C. , and its first international center in 1987 in London. Today , it maintains a network of project centers that span the globe , with more than 20 project centers located throughout North America and Central America , Africa , Australia , Asia , and Europe. About two thirds of WPI undergraduates now travel off campus to complete professional level projects , with half working overseas , gaining an invaluable global outlook. WPI awarded its first advanced degree in 1898. Today most of WPI's academic departments offer advanced degree programs that can be pursued on a full - or part - time basis. WPI's world - class faculty work with students in a number of cutting - edge research areas , leading to breakthroughs and innovations in such fields as biotechnology , fuel cells , information security , materials processing , and nanotechnology. Notable academic and research centers at WPI include the Center for Fire Safety Studies , which offers one of the world's only graduate programs in fire protection engineering ; the Metal Processing Institute , the largest industry - university alliance in North America ; and the Bioengineering Institute , which develops and commercializes cutting - edge technology in the life sciences. WPI is making a significant investment in life - sciences - related research and in the economic development of its home city by jointly developing an 11 - acre former brownfields site adjacent to downtown Worcester into a mixed - use , life sciences based campus. The first new building at the site , the WPI Life Sciences and Bioengineering Center , a 124 , 000 - square - foot research facility , now houses the university's graduate research programs in such areas as tissue engineering and stem cell biology ; tissue mechanics and mechanobiology ; plant systems ; molecular nanotechnology and molecular sensors ; applied molecular genetics ; and medical imaging , diagnostics , and sensing. Gateway Park is a short walk from WPI's attractively landscaped 80 - acre campus , which is bordered by public parks and scenic residential areas. WPI's 29 , 000 alumni are located throughout the United States and in more than 80 other nations. Through the years , WPI alumni have been responsible for many world changing innovations , including the liquid - fueled rocket , stainless steel , the airbag safety system , and the Segway Human Transporter.</DIV></DIV>

A Message from the SGA President 

On behalf of the students of Xavier University of Louisiana it is my pleasure to invite you to consider a college experience that will change and enhance your life forever. 

Xavier alumni are known across the world for being exceptional doctors and lawyers educators and journalists philanthropists research scientists and the like. And despite the damages to our campus last August from Hurricane Katrina I can assure you that choosing Xavier is still a great choice indeed. 

As a Senior Business Administration major with a concentration in Finance and president of the Student Government Association (SGA) I know that Xavier has thoroughly prepared me for my career in Corporate America while nurturing me spiritually and socially. True I never might have imagined attending a school in a city that experienced so much tragedy following Hurricane Katrina. However with tragedy comes great opportunity to triumph. 

Since our campus reopened in January 2006 after repairing the hurricane damage the Xavier family has grown stronger. People in general seem more appreciative of friends family and what some might call sentimental values. In a way Hurricane Katrina may have added to the character of people and enhanced the very principles this university was founded upon. 

The university's founder St. Katharine Drexel understood the necessity to provide minority students with a quality education - second to none - and the skills needed to be better leaders AND servers in order to help build a more just and humane society. What better time than now to become a part of the rebuilding of New Orleans - one of America's most unique cities - while gaining one of the best college educations in the world? 

Finally take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities that Xavier provides you.  Higher education is not only about gaining intellectual knowledge but acquiring social and community skills as well.  Extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet new people find your place and to create wonderful memories of your time here. At Xavier we offer a wide array of clubs organizations and teams to suit the needs and interests of the student body.  Some of these clubs include:  Peer Dean Association Commuter Student Association Xavier Activities Board Jazz Band NAACP Men's and Women's Basketball Business Achievers Club MAX (Mobilization at Xavier) and the PanHellenic Council.

The Yale Bulldogs compete in the Ivy League and are well known for their rivalry with Harvard. Students are assigned to live in one of 12 residential colleges during their time at Yale. Each college has a master and dean who live in the college and eat with students in the dining halls. Cultural houses provide a space for students to build a sense of cultural identity on campus.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold; background-color:Tomato; color: White;">fp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Yale is both a small college and a large research university. The College is surrounded by eleven distinguished graduate and professional schools , and its students partake in the intellectual stimulation and excitement of a major international center of learning. The faculty is known for its special devotion to undergraduate teaching. Many of Yale's most distinguished senior professors teach introductory courses as well as advanced seminars to undergraduates. Faculty members are accessible to students and take a great deal of interest in working closely with undergraduates. Yale's curriculum allows students to achieve both breadth and specialization across several disciplines. Students are expected to explore three important areas of knowledge - the arts and humanities , social sciences , and natural sciences - even as they probe the depth of a major field. While exploring several subject areas , students are also expected to sharpen their writing , quantitative , and foreign language skills. Yale's unique residential college system organizes the student body into twelve small and intimate communities. Students are affiliated with the same residential college throughout their four years at Yale and beyond. As members of a residential college , students experience the living situation of a small school while still enjoying the cultural and scholarly resources of a large university. In assigning students to residential colleges , Yale seeks to create a microcosm of the larger community within each college , capturing the true diversity of the larger student population. Each residential college is a community where students live , eat , socialize , and pursue academic and extracurricular activities. Yale students are actively involved in the New Haven community , benefiting from and enhancing the city's many cultural , recreational , and political opportunities. New Haven boasts diverse and abundant resources in the arts. There is a vibrant cultural and artistic life in the city , a myriad of opportunities both academic and social , and a plethora of places to eat and have fun. New Haven is part of a Yale education : the experience of contemporary urban life broadens students' perspectives and helps prepare them for life after college. Yale students have a long tradition of intense involvement with extracurricular activity. Life in Yale College provides endless opportunities for students beyond the classroom. Opportunities in theater , music , volunteer service , politics and government , publications , and athletics enrich the undergraduate curriculum and endow Yale College with a special energy and spirit of commitment. Perhaps the first thing that students notice about their college is the caliber of their fellow students. There are talented artists , student government leaders , star athletes , passionate activists , award - winning poets , prize - winning scientists , and people who are just simply "well - rounded." Because Yale students come from such a wide range of ethnic , religious , cultural , geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds , there is a remarkable exchange of ideas. Yale is a major research university that focuses primarily on undergraduate education and encourages students to become energetic citizens of their communities , the nation , and the world.</DIV></DIV>

With 4600 full-time students York is a rare breed: an ideally-sized private college. 

But does size really make a difference? Incoming freshman think so: it's their #1 reason for choosing York. York is small enough to maintain its strong student focus. Classes are small. Students build close relationships with faculty and enjoy one-on-one advising and counseling. You won't find that at a big state school certainly not at the undergraduate level. Yet York is large enough to provide much more extensive resources than you find at most small colleges. Our campus facilities are fantastic - come see for yourself.

Soon after its founding Carroll affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and adopted the motto "Christo et Litteris" which means "for Christ and Learning." The college???s early patrons believed that higher education would serve as an instrument for civilizing the wilderness spreading the Gospel and planting the roots of democracy deep in the prairie soil. They also sought to provide for the prosperity of their children and future generations. As 
Wisconsin???s oldest institution of higher learning Carroll is known today as the "Pioneer College." Throughout its history the Carroll educational experience has been marked by teaching excellence and individualized attention. Today 162 years after the college???s founding these values continue to anchor a superior education geared to ensure students??? success in the 21st century. The college???s educational philosophy is sustained by the four pillars of integrated knowledge lifelong skills gateway experiences and enduring values. Integrated Knowledge is the very foundation of a quality liberal arts program. The Carroll curriculum emphasizes breadth and depth of learning. Our purpose is to encourage students to recognize the interrelationships among ideas. We believe that students with this understanding will continue to learn grow and succeed long after they leave the campus. Lifelong Skills help students prepare for life and work in a world of rapid and constant change. We believe that graduates will continue to evolve and contribute to their communities long after they earn their degrees. To that end our mission is to help students learn to think critically and creatively adapt to changing technologies work efficiently and effectively collaborate with others and communicate clear compelling ideas. Enduring Values help students to consider always the impact of their actions on the world around them. We believe that effective leaders draw their inspiration from strong personal value systems. Our goal therefore is to offer students multiple opportunities to make decisions and then to reflect upon their consequences. Gateway Experiences occur both upon entering and upon leaving Carroll College. We believe that our educational responsibility extends beyond the classroom into every aspect of our students??? lives. That is why we place a special emphasis on preparing incoming students for college life and on helping graduates make successful transitions into their first jobs or graduate and professional schools. The four pillars undergird all that we do at Carroll College. They are integral to our undergraduate curriculum and guide our post-baccalaureate and graduate programs. They provide the broad inspiration for the Carroll experience and the many relationships we nurture with other organizations and institutions. An education at Carroll College offers a student alternatives from which to choose a worthwhile personal professional and civic life. It promotes intellectual growth that culminates in the capacity for serious and creative thinking. Based on a core of studies in the liberal arts and sciences complemented by career preparation and co-curricular programs a Carroll education encourages growth in international and cultural awareness social responsibility moral sensitivity and spiritual reflection. A Carroll education begins with the acquisition of fundamental skills and bodies of knowledge. These skills include critical inquiry effective communication aesthetic understanding quantitative reasoning and the capacities to gather and assimilate information and to identify and solve problems.

All 12 schools grant graduate degrees. Catholic University's student body is almost evenly divided between undergraduate and graduate students totaling approximately 6800. The university was founded in 1887 as a graduate institution.

Recent additions to the graduate offerings include a master of science degree in business analysis for nonbusiness majors as well as master's of science programs in nuclear environmental protection biotechnology and materials science and engineering for those with undergraduate degrees in science looking to enter those lucrative fields. 
CUA undergraduates begin their academic career with First Year Experience which introduces them to philosophy theology rhetoric and logic through study in small supportive learning communities. This coursework engages them in thinking about discussing and writing about the great questions that have shaped human history and that continue to confront us today. 
Students have unique opportunities to address those questions worldwide through CUA's education abroad programs.

When it comes to research , the advantage becomes even more pronounced , as faculty in all departments and programs closely engage students in research projects -- sometimes as early as their first year. By the time they are seniors , it is not unusual for motivated students to have presented work at conferences or even to have co - authored papers in academic journals. Service - learning centered around the upstate New York region is also a hallmark of a Colgate education , providing opportunities for students to engage in a broad range of philanthropic activities that tackle public issues and test their knowledge in real world settings. The experience beyond the classroom transforms students , fostering an awareness and appreciation for something larger than themselves. The volunteer engagement of town and gown contribute to a level of activity and quality of life that sets the area apart. In addition , Colgate is a national leader in off - campus study programs , offering more than 20 semester - long programs led by members of the Colgate faculty all over the world , from London to Kyoto , from Venice to Wollongong , from Beijing to Port of Spain. The university sends its own faculty on study groups to teach , mentor , and help students explore. Domestic programs also offer opportunities for a semester of study off campus. Colgate's campus is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful in the nation , and its location in the village of Hamilton in Central New York is a distinguishing feature. Students love the location for its accessibility to outdoor activities. Colgate's Outdoor Education program provides students a chance to explore the natural world while learning about themselves. Whether it is winter camping in the nearby Adirondacks , learning to kayak in nearby Lake Moraine , cross - country and downhill skiing , or learning basic wilderness survival skills , there is something for everyone. Students also bring their passion and enthusiasm to more than 100 extracurricular clubs and activities. Colgate has an extremely active culture , with clubs for just about every possible interest , including politics , media , religion , sustainability , and entertainment and arts. Students' connections with the campus community continue long after graduation. They become extraordinarily devoted alumni , contributing significantly to career networking and exploration programs on and off campus. Every year , alumni play a crucial role in helping students transition from campus life to the working world.</DIV></DIV>

Students are living their learning -- in the acquisition , in the sharing , and ultimately in the being out in the world. So is the faculty in their engaged , intensive , interdisciplinary teaching , their one - on - one advising , and their collaborative research with students. And so is the staff , who take students into their lives and serve as teachers in often important and unexpected ways. Students become most alive in their education when they pursue a single subject for an uninterrupted time in small class communities under the college's Block Plan. In stimulating learning environments -- classroom and library , field and laboratory , stage and studio , residence halls and student center , the local community and foreign countries -- students immerse themselves in rigorous academic adventure. This experience , combined with athletics , outdoor recreation , student organizations , residential life , and community service offers students a true renaissance in the Rockies.</DIV></DIV>

Chanin School of Architecture is to provide for its students the finest professional education available within an intellectual environment that fosters and expands their creative capacities and sensibilities and establishes the foundation for a productive professional life. The School is committed to the belief that one of society's prime responsibilities is toward learning and education in the deepest sense : that the exercise of individual creativity within a willing community is a profoundly social act. Fundamental to the mission of the School is the maintenance of an atmosphere in which freedom of thought and exploration can flourish , where students can explore and utilize their special and individual talents , interests and modes of working , to their highest potential. The mission of the School of Art is to educate artists in the broadest sense , both as creative practitioners engaged with a wide range of disciplines in the visual arts and as enlightened citizens of the world who are prepared to question and transform society. The program is structured around an integrated curriculum that fosters connections between disciplines , as well as between traditional and new media. The studio experience affords the opportunity for the development of individual artistic vision in dialogue with collective debates and experiments within an intimate community of artists. The study of history , theory and criticism in the visual arts and general studies in the humanities and social sciences are considered essential in intellectually grounding studio practice. Central to the school's philosophy is the advancement of the artist's role in initiating critical responses and alternative models in relation to the prevailing forms and institutions of cultural production. Students are challenged to expand their research and experimentation across The Cooper Union , as well as in the surrounding urban environment and in the wider public sphere. The Albert Nerken School of Engineering will create an educational culture with a commitment to excellence. We will bring together the best and brightest engineering students ; we will nurture and develop their talents ; we will encourage them to work and learn at their highest levels ; and we will instill in them the desire and the ability to use their engineering background to fulfill their potential as knowledgeable , creative and responsible leaders in society.</DIV></DIV>

The "Eastern Student Experience" guided by that mission grows out of the University's commitment to interpretation and formation.  This intellectually curious and socially active community views and interprets the world through lenses ground from faith reason and justice. Every course syllabus integrates those three elements in the learning experience. Student formation employs the same three integrated elements in preparing graduates for influential and ethical lives. Eastern is one of only a handful of universities in the world that incorporate all three in constructing a path to knowledge. 

The unique value of a theory of knowledge and student development that is based on the synthesis of faith reason and justice is evidenced clearly by Eastern students' activism. The SPEAK organization has recently moderated summer reconciliation talks between Catholic and Protestant students in Northern Ireland and between Latino youth gangs in Philadelphia. They also led an effort on campus that persuaded administration to make Eastern one of only eight campuses nationally to convert to 100% use of wind generated electricity. Another organization Youth Against Complacency and Homelessness Today (YACHT Club) partners with Eastern alumni in the operation of two centers in Philadelphia that provide shelter tutoring and temporary work for homeless families. A third group Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE) teaches market economics and provides academic tutoring to high school students in two of Philadelphia's most economically challenged and violent neighborhoods. Students from Eastern's Templeton Honors College tutor elementary and middle school students from those same neighborhoods in science and mathematics. Graduate students in economic development work with World Vision and Habitat for Humanity in the third world where Eastern graduates have helped generate more than 1 million new jobs over the last two decades. The Seminary's Sider Center for Ministry and Public Policy engages students for church-based community development activities in Camden Philadelphia and Washington D.C.

Eastern operates Esperanza College a bi-lingual junior college in north Philadelphia. After visiting that campus the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation invited Eastern to develop an Early College High School (ECHS) in the city. The ECHS model could prove to be a major breakthrough in urban teaching and learning. The research that Eastern faculty will generate from that work will be part of a comparatively large body of scholarship published by the university's teacher-scholar-activists. Eastern students have many opportunities to assist that research.

Classes and justice activities combine with spiritual formation activities to develop students who love God and neighbor with heart hands and mind. Along the way Eastern students also have a great deal of fun. Ultimately however the university's unique mission is fulfilled when graduates influence the course of events in their communities and beyond after leaving Eastern.</DIV><DIV class="tc"><SPAN style="color: Green;">tp</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tc">Eastern is a Christian University of the arts and sciences dedicated through teaching and learning , scholarship , spiritual formation , student development and community service to the preparation of undergraduate , graduate , and theological students for lives of faith , leadership and service.
