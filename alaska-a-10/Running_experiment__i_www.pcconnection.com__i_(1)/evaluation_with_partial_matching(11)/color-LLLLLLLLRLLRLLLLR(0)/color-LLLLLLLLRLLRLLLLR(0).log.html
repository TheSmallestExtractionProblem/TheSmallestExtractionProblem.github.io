Now you can be there when the winning goal hits the back of the net. Or get a front - row view of the school play—from any seat in the house. The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 35x optical zoom telephoto lens delivers crisp detail and sharp focus every time , putting you in the middle of the action no matter where it’s happening. 3” Tilt LCD Screen : See life from a whole new angle and add excitement to your images. The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 3.0" ( 75mm ) Tilt Display offers a full 135 - degree range of motion. So now you can easily frame and capture a low - angle image from the best position—or even hold the camera over a crowd and still see exactly what you’re getting. Low light Shot : Show your subject in the best possible light—in moonlight , candlelight , or practically no light at all. Low - Light Shot mode takes three continuous shots , and then merges them all into one clear , bright image with minimal blur or noise. 16MP CMS Sensor : Trust your equipment and shoot with confidence. The super - fast , super - sensitive 16 - megapixel BSI ( back side–illuminated ) CMOS sensor needs less light for proper exposure and quicker focus than conventional sensors. So even if a moment happens in a heartbeat , or is lit only by the reflected glow of the moon , with the Samsung WB2100 Camera , your photos will be sure to match your memories. Optical Image Stabilization : The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s Optical Image Stabilization ( OIS ) gives your images crisp focus , even if you’re not perfectly still. Shoot with confidence in any condition to experience photos that come out sharp and clear—in low - light situations , when zooming in for a shot , or while you’re on the move. Panorama Shot : Don’t be limited to landscapes or group portraits when taking panoramic shots with a wide - angle lens. Simply aim the camera with the shutter pressed fully down and then release when you’re ready to take the shot. Once the shots have been taken , Samsung’s proprietary panoramic technology automatically searches for motion borders of the two images and stitches them together as if a professional had taken the shot. Full HD Recording with Movie Zoom : The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 35x optical wide zoom capability delivers smooth Full HD 1080 / 60i video and amazing low - light performance. And Movie Zoom automatically adjusts and optimizes sound settings—while eliminating motor “whir”—to give you crystalclear audio performance , too. And with an advanced HDMI interface , the WB2100 is one camera that works hard and plays well with others. Rich Tone : Capture the blazing light and subtle depth of a sunset over water. With Rich Tone ( HDR ), the Samsung WB2100 Camera offers a greater range of luminance , so shadows aren’t too dark and highlights aren’t oversaturated. The result : perfect exposure in all areas , and vibrant details that pop.
