HD Recording Format 1080p ( HDTV ) HD Recording Format 720p ( HDTV ) Camera Type SLR / Professional Resolution 14.2 Megapixel There are several different types of digital cameras. Compact and Ultra - compact are light , pocket - sized cameras that are easy to carry , usually with a built - in lens. Standard point - and - shoot cameras are of medium size , usually come with a built - in lens , and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR / Professional cameras are usually larger , but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional. Weight 1 lb. The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints.

Image Sensor Type CCD Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Video Resolutions 640 x 424 A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Video Format HD ( 1280 x 720 ) 1920 x 1080 QuickTime Many digital cameras let you record short clips of highly compressed , low - resolution video , either as an MPEG movie or a Motion JPEG movie. This number shows the actual optimal size for a movie captured on your camera. Max Movie Length 600 Seconds Video Speed 24 fps ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 3200 6400 12800 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.

Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Shutter Speed 60 - 1 / 4000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) 2.5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures.

These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual 8 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 800 External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.

Weight 1.57 lb. The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. Image Resolutions 3008 x 2000 Camera Resolution 1824 x 1216 3872 x 2592 10.8 Megapixel The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares.

Image Sensor Type CCD Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Focus Type Autofocus A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Focal Length 18 - 55 mm Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses The distance from the center of the lens to the image of an object at infinity. At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. 35mm Zoom Lens 28 mm Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Optical Zoom 3x Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 10 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds Auto The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field. Flash Type 100 200 400 800 1600 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.

Optical Zoom 3.1x Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 1 / 2 - 1 / 4000 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Incandescent ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 30 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds Auto Flash Type 100 200 3200 6400 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Flash Off Compression Type Auto Flash Manual JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Memory Type Raw Image DPOF EXIF 2.21 DCF 2.0 SD Card Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution. The resolution of the pictures you take affects their quality as well as the amount of memory they utilize. Higher resolution results in higher quality , but takes up more memory. Tripod Mount With Tripod Mount There are many types of memory / media for digital cameras , but most models are compatible with only one. The most common are CompactFlash and SmartMedia. Many other cameras use Memory Stick and some write the pictures directly onto mini - CDs or floppy disks.

Image Resolutions 4928 x 3264 Camera Resolution 16.3 Megapixel The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Image Sensor Type CMOS Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Video Resolutions 640 x 480 ( VGA ) A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Video Format 1280 x 720 1920 x 1080 AVI Many digital cameras let you record short clips of highly compressed , low - resolution video , either as an MPEG movie or a Motion JPEG movie. This number shows the actual optimal size for a movie captured on your camera. Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Optical Zoom 3x Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 1 / 8000 - 30 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Colour Temperature Adjust 30 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 1600 80 12800 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Flash Off Compression Type Auto Flash Rear Sync Flash Fill - in Flash Red - eye Reduction Flash Slow Sync JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Compression Modes Uncompressed Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution. The resolution of the pictures you take affects their quality as well as the amount of memory they utilize. Higher resolution results in higher quality , but takes up more memory. Memory Type SD Card Built - in Microphone SDHC Card SDXC Card With Built - in Microphone There are many types of memory / media for digital cameras , but most models are compatible with only one. The most common are CompactFlash and SmartMedia. Many other cameras use Memory Stick and some write the pictures directly onto mini - CDs or floppy disks. It is helpful to choose some sort of memory device that is easy to find in stores , in case you need to purchase extra. Self Timer 2 Sec. Self Timer 12 Sec.</DIV></DIV>

Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second 2.5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds 200 The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo.

Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses 35mm Zoom Lens 18 - 55 mm Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Optical Zoom 3x Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second 2.5 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f3.5 / f5.6 ( w / t ) ISO Speeds 200 The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field. Flash Type 1600 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.

On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Image Sensor Type CCD Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Video Resolutions 640 x 424 A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming.

At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. 35mm Zoom Lens 28 - 135 mm Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 8000 sec White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

Camera Type SLR / Professional Resolution 10.8 Megapixel There are several different types of digital cameras. Compact and Ultra - compact are light , pocket - sized cameras that are easy to carry , usually with a built - in lens. Standard point - and - shoot cameras are of medium size , usually come with a built - in lens , and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR / Professional cameras are usually larger , but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional. Optical Zoom Without Optical Zoom The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Digital Zoom Without Digital Zoom The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. Weight 1.09 lb. Unlike optical zoom , digital zoom magnifies the pixels but not the actual image. The resulting image appears bigger , but is not as sharp as with an optical zoom.

Image Sensor Type CCD Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Optical Zoom Without Optical Zoom Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 1 / 4000 - 30 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual 3 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 1600 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.

On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Image Sensor Type CCD Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Optical Zoom Without Optical Zoom Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Shutter Speed 1 / 4000 - 30 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual 3 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. ISO Speeds 100 Flash Type 1600 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Auto Flash Compression Type Rear Sync Flash Fill - in Flash Red - eye Reduction Flash Slow Sync JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Compression Modes Raw Image DPOF EXIF 2.21 DCF 2.0 Fine Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution. The resolution of the pictures you take affects their quality as well as the amount of memory they utilize. Higher resolution results in higher quality , but takes up more memory. Compression Modes Normal Compression Modes Uncompressed Compression Modes Basic Memory Type SD Card Tripod Mount SDHC Card With Tripod Mount There are many types of memory / media for digital cameras , but most models are compatible with only one. The most common are CompactFlash and SmartMedia. Many other cameras use Memory Stick and some write the pictures directly onto mini - CDs or floppy disks. It is helpful to choose some sort of memory device that is easy to find in stores , in case you need to purchase extra. Self Timer 2 Sec. Self Timer 5 Sec. Self Timer 10 Sec. Self Timer 20 Sec.

Weight 19.7 lb. The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high.

On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Image Sensor Type CMOS Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Video Resolutions 1280 x 720 A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Video Format 640 x 424 1920 x 1080 MPEG - 4 Many digital cameras let you record short clips of highly compressed , low - resolution video , either as an MPEG movie or a Motion JPEG movie. This number shows the actual optimal size for a movie captured on your camera. Video Format HD ( High Definition ) Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus Focal Length 18 - 55 mm Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses The distance from the center of the lens to the image of an object at infinity. At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. 35mm Zoom Lens 105 - 450 mm Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. Optical Zoom 3x Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec The optical zoom ratio of a digital camera measures how much the lens can actually zoom in to make subjects appear closer. Be careful to not confuse optical zoom with digital zoom. Optical zoom actually enlarges a picture while keeping the resolution and sharpness of the picture high. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Incandescent ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Sunset ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 4 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues. Aperture Range f5.6 ( w ) ISO Speeds 100 The aperture range measures how much light is let into the camera when taking a photo. Low f - stop settings are best for low light photography while higher f - stops provide a greater depth of field. Flash Type 6400 12800 25600 Built - In ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Auto Flash Compression Type JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Compression Modes Uncompressed Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution. The resolution of the pictures you take affects their quality as well as the amount of memory they utilize. Higher resolution results in higher quality , but takes up more memory. Memory Type SD Card Tripod Mount SDHC Card SDXC Card With Tripod Mount There are many types of memory / media for digital cameras , but most models are compatible with only one. The most common are CompactFlash and SmartMedia. Many other cameras use Memory Stick and some write the pictures directly onto mini - CDs or floppy disks.

Camera Resolution 16.5 Megapixel The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Image Sensor Type CMOS Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos.

Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims.

CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Incandescent ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 3 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures.

The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints.

Image Sensor Type CMOS Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Shutter Speed 1 / 60 - 1 / 4000 sec A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 3.4 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form.

ISO Speeds Auto Flash Type 100 3200 6400 12800 Built - In & External ISO stands for International Standards Organization. It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) . Generally , with higher ISO speeds there is more noise. Flash Functions Auto Flash Compression Type JPEG If the camera has a built - in flash , it might have several different flash functions , such as on / off or anti - redeye flash. Compression Modes Raw Image DPOF EXIF 2.21 DCF 2.0 Fine Many cameras include different settings to control photo resolution.

At same size , the distance from copy to image is four times the focal length of the lens. This also applies to lithographic process lens as well. A 35mm SLR camera has interchangeable lenses that can range in focal length from around 7 to 17mm which are usually fisheye , 17 to 35 are considered wide angle. 50mm is called the standard lens as it has the same equivalent focal length as the human eye. Anything longer is a telephoto lens. Usually expressed in millimeters , smaller focal lengths result in wider fields - of - view. Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 8000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

HD Recording Format 720p ( HDTV ) Camera Type SLR / Professional Resolution 12.3 Megapixel There are several different types of digital cameras. Compact and Ultra - compact are light , pocket - sized cameras that are easy to carry , usually with a built - in lens. Standard point - and - shoot cameras are of medium size , usually come with a built - in lens , and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR / Professional cameras are usually larger , but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional. Digital Zoom Without Digital Zoom The sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels , which are tiny light - sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels , each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels â and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has , the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand , the megapixels determine the size of the print , so higher megapixels means larger print sizes , for examples , 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints , 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints. Weight 1.36 lb. Unlike optical zoom , digital zoom magnifies the pixels but not the actual image. The resulting image appears bigger , but is not as sharp as with an optical zoom.

Image Sensor Type CMOS Resolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Video Resolutions 1280 x 720 A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Video Format 320 x 216 640 x 424 Motion JPEG Many digital cameras let you record short clips of highly compressed , low - resolution video , either as an MPEG movie or a Motion JPEG movie.

Max Movie Length 24 Seconds Focus Type Manual Focus Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Incandescent ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) Flash ( Preset ) 24 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance , the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue , green or orange hues.

It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light ( based on an arithmetical progression ) . Though digital cameras don't use film , they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed ; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions , adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe , ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA ( American Standards Association ) .

Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers. Focus Type Autofocus & Manual Focus A CCD sensor will provide a sharper more precise image , but is generally more power consuming. CMOS sensors are generally more energy efficient and are creating better and better images as technology develops. Interchangeable Lens Interchangeable Lenses Shutter Speed 30 - 1 / 4000 sec Higher - end cameras may allow you to separate the camera body from the lens , allowing you to interchange lenses for different types of photography. White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result. Frames Per Second Manual Daylight / Sunny ( Preset ) Cloudy ( Preset ) Fluorescent ( Preset ) Tungsten ( Preset ) Shade ( Preset ) 3 Frames The white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts , so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form.

The higher the megapixels , the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take , and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print - quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers.

White Balance Auto The shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables : the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter , opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.

These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example , a setting of 1 / 60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually , a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene , for motion shots , while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused , abstract result.
