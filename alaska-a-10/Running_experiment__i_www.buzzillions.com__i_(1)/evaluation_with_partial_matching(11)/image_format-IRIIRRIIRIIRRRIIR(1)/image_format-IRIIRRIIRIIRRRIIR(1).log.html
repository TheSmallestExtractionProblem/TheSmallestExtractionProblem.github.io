By adding this point - to - shoot ease of use advantage in the DMC - GH2 , the perception of complexity when operating a digital interchangeable lens system camera drastically changed. The focus is immediately set to the subject by just touching the large , 460 , 000 - dot LCD , and you can even trigger the shutter by touch. Once you lock on the subject by a touch , the camera tracks the subject with the AF tracking function even if it moves. Just a touch on the screen lets you select the part and the size of AF area with the 1 - area AF. The touch operation dramatically shortcuts menu settings too. The touch - screen operation excels not only for shooting but also for playing back images with outstanding visibility.

This new compact optional 3D - capable interchangeable lens allows easier handling and instant 3D shooting. It produces 3D images without distortion or time lag between left and right images , even for moving objects. The 3D images , even close - up shots , taken with this lens are easy on the eyes when viewed on 3D VIERA televisions ( mpo side by side format ) . Panasonic made a breakthrough by adding this special way of unprecedented expression in photography with outstanding ease with this innovative technology. The DMC - GH2 provides an array of features that let users capture precisely true - to - life images and create their own beautifully expressive images. The DMC - GH2 features the My Color mode with a total of 7 preset effects  Expressive , Retro , Pure , Elegant , Monochrome , Dynamic Art , and Silhouette while inheriting the previous Custom mode , which lets users manually set the color , brightness and saturation levels. With the Full - time Live View function , users can see how these settings will affect the images before they shoot , which makes it easier to capture the exact mood or atmosphere desired. For even more elaborate effects , users can choose from a total of 10 Film modes including the new Cinema mode , and set the contrast , sharpness and saturation levels for each. A custom function lets users store their favorite settings in memory. The DMC - GH2 also provides a total of 22 , and most of these modes can be used when shooting motion images too , letting users create movies with dramatic , theatrical effects without having to edit after they shoot. Advanced iA ( Intelligent Auto ) mode The DMC - GH2 has advanced functions that will satisfy experienced photographers , yet is easy enough for beginners to use comfortably. It's ideal for compact camera owners who want to step up to higher - quality photos  but without having to worry about complex photographic techniques. Panasonic achieved this superb ease of use by continuing to improve iA mode  with its shooting assist functions that have proven extremely popular in LUMIX compact cameras  and adding it to the advanced imaging technologies of the LUMIX G Micro System. The iA mode is available not only in photo but also movie recording. This iA mode is further advanced to now include Intelligent Dynamic - Range Control and new Intelligent Resolution. The new Intelligent D - range Control offers even more natural looking pictures by optimizing the exposure for each part of an image , preventing blocked shadows and blown highlights and helping ensure that gradation and details are reproduced beautifully including the blue color of the sky. An automatic backlight compensation function is activated whenever the camera detects the subject in backlight. The new Intelligent Resolution technology fe</DIV></DIV>

By tilting the camera during playback , the camera’s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D - like view on the camera’s LCD. Anti - Motion Blur Mode Capture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti - motion Blur Mode , the DSC - TX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur , beyond the capability of traditional cameras. Hand held Twilight Capture cleaner and sharper night shots without using a tripod. When set to Hand held Twilight Mode , the DSC - TX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with one press of the shutter , and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. With these modes , you can capture images in low light , without flash , beyond the capability of traditional cameras. Backlight Correction HDR Shooting high - contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and / or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking two pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of both into a single image for more natural looking shots. TransferJet™ technology TransferJet™ technology , developed by Sony® and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies , allows you to transfer files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching them together , without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing11 .

In addition to High Sensitivity Mode ( ISO ), you can select up to seven ISO settings ( Auto , 125 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 , 3200 ) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. Self - Portrait Timer Self - Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame.

Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization. Optical Image Stabilizer Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake making photos and videos blurry. Canons Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens - shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations : outdoors at dusk inside without a flash and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds accommodating more low - light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced you get a sharper steadier image. And because it is an optical system there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers. DYNAMIC MACRO NORMAL PANNING POWERED TRIPOD 12.1 Megapixel High - Sensitivity CMOS Sensor The PowerShot SX280 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High - Sensitivity CMOS sensor which delivers state - of - the - art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light - capturing design it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high - speed design capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus. Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor The PowerShot SX280 HS is equipped with Canons very latest proprietary processor the DIGIC 6 Image Processor. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor makes several important advancements including improved sensitivity that allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions. Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement ( shift blur ) to create video thats exceptionally free of distortion.

Once a person is registered the camera will pick him or her out of a group ( even against a busy background ) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children focus on your baby when pictured with an adult and capture the best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF ; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because youll identify each face you register Face ID makes it easy to search images by name.

It functions perfectly with or without a flash. A World of Advantages with Canon's Technology. DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self - timer. DIGIC 4 Image Processor - Canon's most advanced image processor , DIGIC 4 , delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you're ready to shoot , then delivers perfect focus. In addition , exposure , flash and white balance are compensated , so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. iSAPS Technology - is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A Face Detection Self - timer - automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include the photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , specify Face Detection Self - timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Intelligent Contrast Correction - DIGIC 4 also makes possible the i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot A1100 IS can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction - provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The PowerShot A1100 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot A1100 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. Capture Your Best Shots Easily.

It automatically links together each frame to produce a high resolution panoramic image providing the ability to zoom in on small details. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion. Background Defocus - DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background , putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point - and - shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots , identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.

If you're looking for new and game - changing aspects , the SLT - A65 has them. Sony's Translucent Mirror Technology system is one for starters. This technology allows the camera to both shoot and focus with speed and accuracy by directing light to the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor. Another huge advantage to the camera - perhaps the most notable - is the 24.3Mp APS - C sensor - this gives you the ability to make huge prints and to experience detail that's absolutely outstanding. What else , you ask? Well , let's see , how do you feel about an OLED viewfinder or shooting at 10 frames per second? How about HD movies with full manual control? Or the ability to utilize Live View with both the viewfinder or the tilt / swivel 3.0" LCD? The SLT - A65 gives you the options you need to take your photos and videos to the next level. When it comes to low - light or night scenes the SLT - A65 doesn't leave you in the dark. The built - in flash allows for spur of the moment or snapshot capture , while the integrated hot shoe lets you add on flashes or other flash accessories. The camera's APS - C sensor works with the BIONZ image processor to ensure that whatever you're shooting the results are stunning and efficiently processed. These systems also work together to reduce noise and enable fast , continuous shooting such as is necessary to shoot 10 frames per second or for 2D / 3D Sweep Panorama modes and 6 - image layering. No matter what you're shooting - video or stills - every file is stored to external memory in one of the two media slots. Dual media slots help you to shoot longer and provide you with the option of storing two different cards at once. Fill one with Memory Stick media perhaps and the other with SD / SDHC / SDXC cards if you feel like it. Your image making is also afforded flexibility thanks to any of the numerous shooting modes and functions. Full - Time Phase Detection AF , for instance , ensures accurate auto focus no matter how you're shooting - even when in HD Movie and Live View modes. Additionally , Full - Time Live View for the LCD or electronic viewfinder ensures that what you view on the screen is what you'll get on the finished file. That means white balance , focus , depth of field , exposure , and framing all are accurately reproduced. Other ways that the SLT - A65 enhances and expands your creativity includes a short lag time , Object Tracking AF for keeping moving objects in focus , and Multi - Frame NR for shooting successfully in low - light without a flash. Graphic Display , the Dynamic Range Optimizer , SteadyShot INSIDE Stabilization and a built - in GPS are just a few of the many other ways in which the A65 ensures that a full breadth of creative options is at your disposal each and every time you shoot.</DIV></DIV>

With the Video Snapshot feature the EOS Rebel T3i DSLR will capture short video clips ( of 2 4 or 8 seconds ) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights album. With no editing needed after shooting the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the cameras HDMI port. In addition to a number of different recording size and frame rate modes the EOS Rebel T3i enables easy manual control of exposure focus and Live View features and even allows for in - camera editing. The large CMOS sensor and compatibility with over 60 lenses provide a wealth of depth - of - field options. And its all as easy as the press of a button - the EOS Rebel T3i has a dedicated Live View / Movie Recording start / stop button that gets the shooting started fast. Vari - angle 3.0 - inch Clear View LCD monitor ( 3 : 2 ) for shooting at high or low angles and 1 040 000 - dot VGA with reflection reduction using multi coating and high - transparency materials for bright and clear viewing. The EOS Rebel T3i features a bright high resolution flip - out Vari - angle 3.0 - inch Clear View LCD monitor for shooting at a variety of angles. By simply rotating the monitor you can hold the camera directly overhead for above - the - crowd shots at concerts or hold the camera at a low angle for kids and pets. By rotating the LCD monitor fully the EOS Rebel T3i becomes the ideal camera for self - portraits. The EOS Rebel T3i freely enables easy angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted on a tripod or has a battery grip attached. With 1 040 000 ( dots / VGA ) pixels for spectacular detail the advanced smudge - resistant monitor includes high transparency materials plus anti - reflective and water - repellant coatings to provide clear and bright viewing. Superb for reviewing editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View function the Vari - angle Clear View LCD monitor is also the perfect means for accessing camera settings like ISO metering modes AF Point selection the horizontal Electronic Level and flash options. Scene Intelligent Auto mode and Picture Style Auto incorporating the EOS Scene Detection System to capture beautiful scenes with ease. The EOS Rebel T3i DSLRs Scene Intelligent Auto mode unites five Canon digital camera technologies - Picture Style Auto plus Automatic Lighting Optimizer Automatic White Balance Autofocus and Automatic Exposure - into a powerful new feature for photographers. Using the advanced EOS Scene Detection System the camera automatically analyzes the image taking into account faces colors brightness movement and contrast. Scene Intelligent Auto then chooses the enhancing features to deliver maximum impact. Blues and greens are more vivid hot colors are more fiery and skin tones are smooth and truer to life. Express your creativity with advanced imaging features like Basic+ function Multi - Aspect function and Creative Filters. Basic+ is a creative imaging feature that makes it easy to create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options : Shoot by ambience selection Based on the Picture Style and its parameters ( sharpness contrast saturation and color tone ) the exposure compensation and white balance correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also can also select the strength of the ambience effect. Shoot by lighting or scene type Although the actual parameter set is the white balance the settings are expressed in more understandable terms. The Multi - Aspect Function of the EOS Rebel T3i lets you express an image in one of three ways by matching the aspect ratio to each scene. In addition to the camera’s standard 3 : 2 ration the Multi - Aspect Function includes a 1 : 1 ratio that creates the sensation that the viewers gaze is focusing upon the center of the image. At the 4 : 3 ratio you get nearly the same aspect ratio as a regular TV or a 4 : 3 computer display. The 16 : 9 aspect ratio provides a wide look much the same as HDTV. The EOS Rebel T3i incorporates five in - camera Creative Filters so you can artistically manipulate scenes without the aid of an outside computer. Soft Focus lends a dreamy romantic aspect while Grainy Black and White gives a dramatically gritty hard - bitten look. Miniature Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly reduced to doll - house - like proportions and Toy Camera Effect recreates the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens an effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics the Fisheye lenses that are favorites of professional photographers for their quirky convex perspective. Enhanced metering with a 63 - zone Dual - layer metering system for accurate metering between exposures and 9 - point AF system utilizing a high precision f / 2.8 cross - type center point. The EOS Rebel T3i features a sophisticated 63 - zone Dual - layer sensor designed to complement the 9 - point AF system. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points this system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized ; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes such as in a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes ; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high - speed X - sync ( X - sync means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released ) up to 1 / 200 sec. the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes or dim. 3.7 fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAW. The EOS Rebel T3i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second ( fps ) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full - resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1 / 4000 sec. the EOS Rebel T3i can capture even rapidly - unfolding scenes with ease. Feature Guide offers short descriptions of each function and Quick Control screen for easy operation. The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR demystifies great photography by including an in - camera Feature Guide. Appearing on the cameras LCD the Feature Guide displays a simple description or advice for the respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode during Mode Dial operations and for Quick Control screen functions ( during normal shooting Live View shooting movie shooting and playback ) .

The combination of these two technologies affords a high sensitivity level of ISO 51200 , full - resolution continuous shooting rate of 6 fps , and renders both still images and videos with notable image quality and clarity. Full HD 1080p video recording is supported in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps as well as HD 720p recording up to 60 fps. Video files are recorded in the high quality H.264 AVC / MPEG - 4 codec and saved as .MOV files for easier sharing and editing. When recording video or making still imagery with live view , a 3.0" 921k - dot LCD monitor is available and provides a wide viewing angle for improved viewing in a variety of shooting positions. Benefitting the image quality is the SAFOX IXi+ autofocus system , which works to ensure sharp , accurate focus quickly and smoothly. Additionally , when working with manual focus , focus peaking is available to provide a more objective and comparable method of acquiring critical focus. Also contributing to image sharpness is in - camera sensor shift image stabilization , which reduces the appearance of camera shake by about three shutter speed steps when working in low - light conditions or with longer focal length lenses. For extensive control over image - making , in - camera RAW ( DNG ) image processing is available as well as HDR shooting capabilities. For expediting control over the most oft - used functions of the K - 50 , both the front and rear e - dials are customizable and can be programmed to control an array of exposure settings and camera functions. For creatively modifying imagery in - camera , a variety of filters , scene modes , and auto modes are available to enhance the look and feel of imagery prior to post - processing. In addition to the range of automatic camera settings , traditional manual shooting modes are also available , such as program , shutter - priority , aperture - priority , sensitivity - priority , and manual. All of the K - 50's technologies are housed within a polycarbonate - covered camera body that is supported by a stainless steel chassis. This body design is fully weather - sealed and protects the camera from moisture and dust as well as extreme temperatures from 14 - 104°. Additionally , the design of the camera allows the use of either the standard lithium - ion battery pack or four AA batteries as its power source when used in conjunction with the optional D - BH109 AA Battery Holder. Included with the K - 50 camera body is the smc Pentax DA 18 - 55mm f / 3.5 - 5.6 AL WR lens , which provides a 35mm - equivalent focal length of 27.0 - 82.5mm , covering wide - angle to portrait - length perspectives to suit working in a wide variety of situations. The lens construction integrates aspherical elements to help minimize chromatic</DIV></DIV>

Capture landscapes with one touch using Sweep Panorama ; get that perfect portrait with Face Detection and Smile Shutter technologies , capture wider scenes with the 26mm wide angle lens , and automatically get clear shots with SteadyShot image stabilization and iAuto. Features : 12.1 Megapixel Super HAD CCD Image Sensor A powerful 12.1 megapixel 1 / 2.3" Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 12.1 megapixels , you can create stunning , photo - quality prints up to A3+ ( 13x19" ) size , or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. 2.7" Clear Photo LCD display ( 230k pixels ) Generous 2.7" ( 230K pixels ) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp , natural color that makes it easy to compose shots , read menus , and view photos , even in bright sunlight. Sony Lens with 4x Optical Zoom and 26mm equivalent wide angle The Sony 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for great outdoors , sports , and travel photos. Thanks to 26mm equivalent wide angle of this lens you can also get great group shots in tight spots. Sweep Panorama mode Reach beyond the traditional wide angle lens , and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed , then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra - wide options , the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 231 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep. SteadyShot image stabilization SteadyShot image stabilization compensates for camera shake and helps prevent blur through use of digital processing technologies. Intelligent Auto Mode Unlike traditional auto mode , Intelligent Auto ( iAuto ) mode thinks for you , recognizing scenes , lighting conditions , faces , and adjusts settings resulting clear images , faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground , landscape shots , a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party ; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode. Face Detection technology Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus , exposure , and white balance to help deliver crisp , properly lit images of family and friends. Smile Shutter technology Smile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene , even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. 480p AVI VGA Movie Mode3 In 480p AVI movie mode the camera shoots 640 x 480 movies at 30 fps , which is the format when working with a PC. Users will create movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac. Once transferred to your computer you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video - sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube. ( Compatible computer with internet capability required ) Soft Skin mode Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. Natural Flash Conventional point - and - shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color , for far more lifelike images. Self - Portrait Timer Self - Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face , it triggers a 2 - second timer , and then snaps a picture. Anti - blink Function It's frustrating to capture the perfect shot , only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti - blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap , the Anti - blink function captures two images , recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes , a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. Dynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus Dynamic Range Optimizer ( DRO ) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. Intelligent Scene Recognition ( iSCN ) Mode Intelligent Scene Recognition ( iSCN ) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and , within just 1 / 30th of a second , selects the appropriate camera settings : Backlight , Backlight Portrait , Twilight , Twilight Portrait , Portrait , Landscape and macro. iSCN has two modes : Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode , the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode , the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and , if in difficult lighting ( low light or back light ) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. High Sensitivity Mode ( ISO 3200 ) High ISO allows for faster shutter speed , so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode ( ISO ), you can select up to seven ISO settings ( Auto , 125 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 , 3200 ) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. Easy Shooting Mode With Easy Shooting Mode , even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode , easy - to - understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings , removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition , the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. In - Camera Retouching Tools Retouch and enhance your photos on the go with in - camera Trimming , Red - Eye Correction , and Unsharp Masking functions. PHOTOMUSIC4 PHOTOMUSIC4 combines images with music ( 4 tracks , 5 minutes per track ) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects ( Simple , Nostalgic , Active , and Stylish ) .

Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well - detailed , clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system , including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full - resolution , quickened AF speeds , and full HD 1080p video recording in multiple frame rates with manual exposure and audio level control. Serving both still and movie shooting modes , Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a powerful technology that revolves around the incorporation of two photodiodes within each pixel to provide an expansive phase - detection focusing system. This system affords focusing benefits that are similar to how a camcorder works and as such can focus on subjects in an incredibly fast and precise manner. The benefits of this system are three - fold : the ability to focus quickly and smoothly ; the ability to truly utilize the vari - angle touchscreen LCD monitor to its full potential ; and the ability to utilize a wide range of over 100 EF and EF - S lenses. Also benefiting from Dual Pixel CMOS AF is the Movie Servo AF mode , which enables continuous auto focusing when recording movies. This focusing mode is especially useful for maintaining critical focus on moving subjects and for realizing the near - silent performance of compatible STM lenses. The 3.0" 1 , 040k - dot vari - angle Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari - angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti - reflective , smudge - resistant coating allows for clear viewing in any lighting condition. In addition to the LCD monitor , the 70D also features an optical pentaprism finder that can be used for eye - level shooting of still images. This Intelligent Viewfinder incorporates a superimposed LCD to provide an intuitive means for monitoring exposure and camera settings during shooting. While working with the viewfinder , an expansive 19 - point all cross - type AF system is visualized for acquiring focus ; integral to this array is a high - precision dual - cross center AF point that is compatible with f / 2.8 and faster lenses. Providing a wealth of additional functionality to the camera is integrated Wi - Fi connectivity , which allows for the instant and direct sharing of image files to an iOS or Android mobile device for sharing online. This functionality also allows for wireless remote control over camera settings , including exposure controls , focusing , and shutter release , from a mobile device when using the Canon EOS Remote app.</DIV></DIV>

This genre , if you will , holds its place in the market , intriguing those who want the flexibility that interchangeable lenses and numerous manual and creative features can give them , without having to lug around a huge DSLR body. The NEX - 5N doesn't disappoint. In fact , Sony boasts the camera's extremely small form - factor as being one of the smallest in its class. Size aside , the Alpha NEX - 5N embodies a number of features that make it a worthy option for any connoisseur of digital cameras. First and foremost would be the 16.1Mp APS - C CMOS sensor. With 16.1Mp your images will have lush color and impressive detail. Your options for making enlarged prints are boundless as well. Sony's Exmor APS HD CMOS technology works together with the BIONZ image processor for excellent low light sensitivity and a distinct lack of sensor noise. On the back of the body is a 3.0" Xtra Fine LCD that boasts Sony's TruBlack screen which suppresses internal reflections. This LCD also tilts down 45° and up 80° for framing hard - to - get shots. In addition to capturing still images , every digital junkie longs to let their filmmaker persona out. Sony's NEX - 5N does not disappoint this class of aspiring Spielbergs. The long standing camera company knows that in addition to versatility in lens options , along with a small form - factor , the HD video capture is right up there in importance. Video can be recorded at 1920 x 1080 in a number of frame rates , including 60p and 24p. The camera also uses the AVCHD codec for high - quality capture , and the MP4 codec for easy upload to the Internet. The camera also sports an HDMI output for one - cable sharing of your favorite videos on the big screen ( AKA : your HDTV ) . When it comes to what lenses the NEX - 5N takes , Sony made it compatible with their E - Mount series of smaller , lighter lenses designed specifically for Alpha compact interchangeable lens cameras. Using optional LA - EA1 and EA2 adapters you can also attach A - Mount lenses to the camera as well. The LA - EA2 also provides Phase Detection AF as well. The mirror built - in between the two mounts directs a small portion of light to the phase detection AF sensor in the bottom of the unit , making this feature available to you when the adapter is connected. As for shooting options and modes , the NEX - 5N has a number of them. First up is 10 frames per second shooting , at the camera's full 16.1Mp resolution. This mode enables great sports and kids photos. Another notable feature is Photo Creativity Touch. This mode allows you to be creative with your photos in - camera , right on the LCD screen , in real time. Sweep Panorama and 3D Sweep Panorama modes allow for capture of scenic vistas and 16 : 9 ( wide angle ) shots as panoramas and in wondrous 3D , respectively.

Easy Manual Operation - A / S / M Mode The DMC - ZS10 provides easy - to - use manual controls. Using the Aperture - priority , which creates a soft - focused background effect or the Shutter - priority that , for example , produces a dynamic rendering of streaming water , you can explore your own creative expression at will. You can set both the aperture and shutter speed , to take beautiful , artistic photos. In this mode , the Manual Exposure Assist function shows how much your setting differs from the setting the camera considers optimal. This serves as a convenient guide for anyone using the Manual Exposure. Scene Mode for both Photos and Movies The DMC - ZS10 , a hybrid still / motion image model , includes numerous Scene Modes for taking movies. Switching from still - image to movie shooting is seamless because the optimal Movie Scene Mode is automatically selected. The versatile Scene Mode range is a unique LUMIX feature that handles just about any situation and subject type. The DMC - ZS10 lets you store a frequently used Scene Mode setting in 2 My Scene Modes. Handheld Night Shot Mode ( Photo ) The Handheld Night Shot Mode generates beautiful night scenery with illumination by multiply layering the images shot consecutively. Bright , glamorous night scenery can be recorded without using a tripod. Panorama Assist Mode ( Photo ) This is a handy function for aligning panorama photos using the included software PHOTOfunSTUDIO 6.1 HD Lite Edition. The afterimage of each previous shot is displayed , so you can use it to precisely line up the second and third shots. Select from 4 Aspect Ratios - Newly Added 1 : 1 Aspect Mode In addition to 4 : 3 , 3 : 2 , and 16 : 9 , you can now shoot with a 1 : 1 aspect ratio. This unique square frame adds to your image expression possibilities. The 16 : 9 ratio produces images that match the aspect ratio of an HDTV screen. Being able to match the aspect ratio to your subject and shooting intent gives you even greater control. Macro Zoom The DMC - ZS10 lets you get as close as 3cm to your subject. In addition , when using the Macro Zoom function , you can pull subjects even closer than the closest point possible by using 3x digital zoom , and capture dramatic close - ups. PHOTOfunSTUDIO The PHOTOfunSTUDIO 6.1 HD Lite Edition makes it possible to sort and organize photos not only of those newly taken but also of those stored in your computer with quick start - up and fast read - in of images. The images recorded with GPS information are automatically sorted by the place name making it easy and fun to organize the images taken on your travel. For the portraits , the Face Recognition function that recognizes the faces in the picture automatically sorts the photos by the registered faces without picking out each photo one by one when you only want images of a specific person.Recorded movies can be edited with the Short Movie Story function and written into MPEG2 to burn onto a DVD disc. You can also enjoy making photo and movie slideshows with a variety of effects and use your iTunes music library as background music. It is also possible to put a title or add comments on the scene utilizing the information from the place names recorded with GPS and from the people's names registered in Face Recognition.In addition to the direct connection of the camera , you can upload photos to Facebook and movie to YouTube via this software , too. Custom Mode Your frequent setting patterns can be memorized up to three and it can be instantly applied by simply selecting this function with the camera. Quick Menu Frequently used functions can be quickly retrieved and easily switched by using the Q.MENU button. The function names are displayed in text form , making them easy for anyone to understand and use. Super LoiLoScope ( Trial Version ) You can easily edit , convert and manage movies that you took in AVCHD format. And there are many effects to choose from.

It is also possible to upload the slideshow to YouTube. Title Edit / Text Stamp The Title Edit function in the playback mode lets you edit the titles of any photos you want. You can also record information of the place when taking photos in the GPS Mode or enter the birth date and name of your subject in the Baby Mode or Pet Mode.

Built - in 18MB Memory Take photos even when you don't have an SD / SDHC / SDXC Memory Card on hand. The built - in memory holds up to approx. 18MB of image data , which you can later copy to an SD / SDHC / SDXC Memory Card or computer. You can also copy images from a memory card or computer to the built - in memory , and view them on the LCD anytime you like. Motion Deblur Mode When trying to record children or pets in a dimly lit room , have you ever missed to capture a smiling face or a special moment because your subject moved , causing the image to blur?With the DMC - ZS10 , the Motion Deblur Mode* prevents blurring with even greater power.This mode integrates the Intelligent ISO Control , which automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed according to the subject's movement , and the advanced contrast control system of Intelligent Exposure , which also optimizes the exposure to prevent over / under - exposed parts in the image. The camera judges the appropriate shutter speed to suppress motion blur according to the subject's movement. The shutter speed rises as high as possible activating the high sensitivity recording by pixel mixed readout method.The camera determines the optimal settings , so anyone can easily capture crisp , clear photos - without blurring. Intelligent ISO Control - Motion Detection The Intelligent ISO Control function detects subject movement and automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the movement and light conditions. When it detects subject motion , it automatically raises the ISO setting and increases the shutter speed to prevent motion blur. On the other hand , when the subject is still and no movement is detected , it takes beautifully natural photos with a low ISO setting. Intelligent Exposure - Light Detection The Intelligent Exposure instantly analyzes the framed image and adjusts the brightness in areas that are too dark due to dim lighting , backlighting or use of the flash. Adjusting the brightness of dark areas , this produces natural images that are close to the way they actually look to the human eye. Intelligent Burst Mode The Intelligent Burst Shooting is available on the DMC - ZS10. It automatically sets the frame rate of burst shooting according to the subject's movement - whether it moves fast or slow - utilizing the mechanism of Intelligent ISO Control. The DMC - ZS10 features the Quick AF. Ordinary AF is activated when the shutter button is pressed half - way , while the Quick AF starts operating as soon as the camera is pointed toward a subject. This dramatically reduces the shutter delay time and lets you take images quickly. Its super - fast focus is ideal for capturing quick images of active children and pets. By setting the camera to the Quick AF , images of sudden shooting opportunities won't be out of focus or blurry. Face Detection AF / AE with Face Recognition The DMC - ZS10 features the Face Recognition , a function that remembers faces. The conventional face detection system captures a face with focus and appropriate exposure but sometimes it falls not on the face you want to capture most beautifully when there are several faces in a frame. The Face Recognition prioritizes focus and exposure right on the face of your special person. In playback , you can choose to display only photos that contain a specific registered face using the Category Playback.The Face Detection also features the Digital Red - eye Correction ( Red - eye Removal ) . The camera takes care of the red - eye effect that often happens when shooting with a flash , to ensure attractive facial expression. Intelligent Scene Selector - Scene Detection When the camera's in the iA Mode , the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to one of Scenery , Portrait , Macro , Night Portrait , Night Scenery , Sunset or Intelligent Handheld Nightshot. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance. You are free from annoying settings every time scene changes when taking images with these most frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results even before you know it.

The COOLPIX S800c Digital Camera shoots photos like a point and shoot camera , but shares them like an Android smart device. Take 16MP photos and edit them using your favorite Google Play apps , then upload them with built - in Wi - Fi connectivity , without ever needing to transfer to another device. Since the camera runs Google Android 2.3 ( "Gingerbread" ) that also means you've got the entire Google Play library of apps at your disposal. Download your favorite photo editing apps , wirelessly transfer photos to your smartphone or tablet , and even email them to friends and family instantly. Not to be outdone by all of the apps and wireless connectivity , Nikon included powerful and convenient imaging technology as well. A 16MP backside illumination CMOS sensor captures high quality photos and videos with excellent detail and clarity -- especially in low light conditions. Whether you're indoors with the lights turned down , or outdoors at night , the BSI sensor is specially designed for improved performance in these tough situations. Where there's low light there's often camera shake , and Nikon's optical Vibration Reduction ( VR ) compensates for this to ensure your images are kept sharp. This technology includes both lens - shift and sensor - shift VR to help you capture the best possible images even in some of the worst conditions. If it gets worse Motion Blur Reduction is yet another option , however this increases the ISO sensitivity and introduces digital noise as a side effect. When capturing a single image just isn't enough , the S800c can also double as a Full HD camcorder , capturing 1080p video in the palm of your hand. Relive your moments in vivid HD and remember not only the sights , but also the sounds , with the built - in stereo microphone.

Pair it with any of Nikons superb NIKKOR DX - and FX - format lenses versatile Speedlights and accessories and the D7100 will be the centerpiece of your creativity for years to come. Key Features : Nikon DX - format CMOS sensor The D7100 employs a Nikon DX - format CMOS sensor with approx. 24.1 effective megapixels. It adopts an image sensor unit designed without an optical low - pass filter to take full advantage of the high resolving power only realized by utilizing a high pixel count. This allows the camera to bring out the true resolving power of 24.1 megapixels combined with NIKKOR lenses to deliver an amazingly sharp rendering of details. Even if trimmed or enlarged the images retain exquisite detail reproduction. EXPEED 3 image - processing engine EXPEED 3 processes multiple tasks in parallel while maintaining high precision to bring out the full potential of the 24.1 megapixels. It excels at color reproduction gradation processing and image quality at high sensitivity. It reproduces human skin tone hair and eye lashes more faithfully. Furthermore from image processing and card recording to image playback and image transfer EXPEED 3 manages massive amounts of data at high speed. Even with Active D - Lighting and high ISO noise reduction continuous shooting speed is not sacrificed realizing relaxed shooting. It also contributes to saving energy in the camera. Spot White Balance -- allows preset of white balance during live view shooting The D7100 comes equipped with a Spot White Balance function that allows you to easily acquire preset manual data based on a specific area of the frame you select during live view. This means that you can effectively achieve pinpoint white balance setting according to the selected subject or a part of it during live view. The selected Spot White Balance area can be moved around with the multi selector in the frame. This eliminates the need to use a gray card so that you can quickly acquire preset data without changing lenses even with a super - telephoto lens attached. This can come in handy when shooting sports indoors or in stadiums where various types of lights are mixed as it allows you to quickly preset the white balance to avoid missing decisive moments. Active D - Lighting for enhanced image quality Even when shooting high - contrast scenes in backlit situations Active D - Lighting preserves details in both highlight areas with varied brightness ( e.g. gradation of the sky ) and shadowy areas maintaining moderate contrast to reproduce brightness as you see it. The D7100 employs a new image - processing system that delivers superior reproduction without shifting color phase even when the strength level is increased. Image - processing time is reduced by high - speed and highly accurate real - time processing within pipelines. Furthermore color reproduction is largely improved thanks to the image - processing engine EXPEED 3. Active D - Lighting is suitable for moving subjects as it does not involve combining two images like HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) . HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) produces a single image with a wider dynamic range High Dynamic Range ( HDR ) function takes two images of different exposures with one shutter release and automatically combines them to produce a single image that has a wider dynamic range. This achieves images with less noise and rich tonal gradation including shadows and highlights even for high - contrast shooting scenes. The smoothness of the area where the two exposures meet is automatically set. HDR is ideal for stationary subjects such as high - contrast landscapes and still lifes. Picture Control System that creates an ideal image by fine - tuning color and tone The D7100 incorporates six types of Picture Control selectable according to your subjects and scenes. Selected Picture Control lets you fine - tune sharpening contrast etc. to match your own image creating ideas. These adjusted Picture Controls can then be stored in the camera and used in image - browsing / editing software ViewNX 2 ( supplied ) and image - editing software Capture NX 2 ( optional ) . Edge - to - edge sharpness achieved by lateral chromatic aberration reduction / automatic distortion control Unlike other correction methods that simply eliminate the colors of chromatic aberration Nikons lateral chromatic aberration reduction compensates for the differences in the resolving sizes of each color. This proves especially effective for reducing image distortion at the edges of a frame and for improving image quality throughout the entire frame regardless of the NIKKOR lenses used. If you set On for Auto distortion control when using G or D lenses barrel distortion caused by a wide - angle lens or pin - cushion distortion caused by a telephoto lens can be compensated. Special Effects bring more creative expression with simple operation The D7100 comes equipped with seven options of Special Effects delivering visual expression only available with digital photography. Whether stills or movies you can produce creative images using simple steps by applying the effects that best reflect your intention without editing software. As the result of an effect is displayed on the LCD monitor in real time you can set the effects while confirming the appearance of your picture.

Feast your eyes on an updated G Series digital camera : The G12. It's ready to impress the advanced amateurs who have always celebrated the G Series. The G12 is still loaded with powerful technologies that has made the G Series cameras so renowned , like the Canon HS SYSTEM , 2.8 - inch Vari - angle PureColor System LCD , and RAW + JPEG image modes. Now , this flagship camera paves the way with these new upgrades like 720p HD Video with stereo sound to get crystal clear footage , multiple aspect ratios , High Dynamic Range , Electronic Level , Tracking AF , a Front Dial and much more to give you even more creative control than before! 10.0 Megapixel sensor combined with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor create Canon's HS SYSTEM for improved low light performance and better image quality. Image Quality That's Better Than Ever. The PowerShot G12 employs the HS SYSTEM by combining a powerful 10.0 Megapixel CCD sensor and Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Thanks to this technological advancement , the G12 is dramatically more sensitive than cameras with identical megapixel counts , and delivers spectacular images with minimal noise. Increased sensitivity demands a higher ISO speed , and the PowerShot G12 delivers with a new maximum setting of ISO 3200. Blur and camera shake are notably reduced for the ultimate in sharpness and clarity. In addition , a new Low Light mode lets you capture images in an astonishing range of conditions. The camera automatically adjusts the ISO speed from ISO 320 to ISO 12800 in relation to ambient brightness , subject movement and camera shake. Shoot beautiful 720p HD video in stereo sound and play back on an HDTV via the HDMI output. Easy HD Shooting and HD Playback. The PowerShot G12 lets you record video in beautiful high definition ( 1280 x 720 pixels ) . The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD videos ( and still photos ) on your HDTV with a mini - HDMI connector for direct connection to a high - definition TV monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal , plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. The PowerShot G12 also includes spectacular video functionality. When shooting video , you can get up close with the 5x Optical Zoom for riveting detail and realism , from the overall appearance to facial expressions! And the camera's Smart AUTO technology that helps ensure the perfect still image works to bring that same quality to your video. Full range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG for the ultimate creative control. Creative Power in Your Control. The PowerShot G12's RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. Utilizes Canon's Hybrid IS to compensate for angular and shift camera shake during close - up shooting. Zoom at Will - You're in the Clear. The PowerShot G12 is equipped with Canon's highly advanced Hybrid IS function , which corrects camera shake from two sources to deliver sharp , blur - free images even when you zoom in close to your subject. Hybrid IS employs both an angular sensor and an accelerometer , enabling it to suppress both the blur caused by the angle of the camera and the "shift blur" that happens when your subject moves parallel to the camera , a problem that is especially noticeable at large zoom factors. With the ability to produce clear , steady images in all situations and at any zoom length , the PowerShot G12 is the camera you'll want to take everywhere. Large , bright 2.8 - inch Vari - angle LCD with 461 , 000 dots for shooting at a variety of angles plus an optical viewfinder. A View That's a Pure Pleasure. The PowerShot G12 gives you a large 2.8 - inch PureColor System LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. But size is only part of the story. Canon's PureColor System LCD offers spectacular color , resolution and contrast even at an angle. The screen is durable and easy to see. It is a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. A high - powered 5x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer , plus a 28mm Wide - Angle Lens gets you up close and personal to your subjects , as well as capture more in your frame. Get More in the Frame. The camera is equipped with a long , 5x Optical Zoom , and Canon's own Optical Image Stabilizer Technology keeps images steady and blur - free all through the zoom range - even in low light - by detecting motion and generating a corrective signal. Because it is an optical system , more corrective movement is allowed and there is no degradation of image quality. The G12 is a highly versatile camera with a wide - angle zoom lens that reaches all the way from 28mm at the wide end to 140mm at the telephoto end ( 35mm format equivalent ) . You'll capture more image in every shot , and add greater depth to your overall photography. A host of optional accessories including Speedlite flashes , underwater housing and Tele - Converter Lens are available. The Creative Freedom You've Wanted. The PowerShot G12 is compatible with the Speedlite flash series intended for all EOS series SLR cameras. Attach a Speedlite flash to the hot shoe , then you can set and control the flash on the "Flash Control" menu in the camera. With a Speedlight , the G12 is given extra functions such as autoflash metering , FE lock and Flash exposure compensation ; continuous shooting with external flash. Also Canon's Speedlite Transmitter ST - E2 enables you to have multiple slave flashes and wireless control. A Tele - Converter lens designed for the G12 , Filter Adapter FA - DC58B and WP - DC34 Waterproof Case is also available. High Dynamic Range scene mode combines multiple shots into one picture showing greater image detail. Beautiful Images with Beautiful Detail. Shooting in high contrast environments can often result in photos with overexposed and underexposed sections. So to tackle this problem , Canon developed the High Dynamic Range shooting mode to make select PowerShot cameras even more intuitive. Under High Dynamic Range the camera will shoot three different exposures in a succession ( underexposed , overexposed and normal ) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa , resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. Dimensions : 4.41 x 3.00 x 1.90 in.</DIV></DIV>

Available for Order Now! Nikon D7000 DX - Format Digital SLR Camera Features Meet the new Nikon D7000 , a camera ready to go wherever your photography or cinematography takes you. Experience stunning images with sharp resolution and smooth tonal gradation , thanks to the 16 megapixel DX - format CMOS image sensor and a powerful EXPEED 2 image processing engine. Take advantage of its wide ISO range of 100 to 6400 ( expandable to 25 , 600 ) and its incredibly low levels of noise. Expect your images tack - sharp and accurately exposed , thanks to the cameras 39 - point AF and Scene Recognition System using a 2 , 016 - pixel RGB matrix metering sensor. And with an approx. 0.052 - second release time lag and approx. 6 frames - per - second shooting , you wont miss a moment. Youll see exactly what youre capturing with the approx. 100% frame coverage viewfinder , and for those who want to shoot both stills and movies , the D7000s D - Movie capabilities now include Full HD 1080p capture with full - time autofocus and manual exposure. All of this advanced imaging technology is kept safe beneath the magnesium alloy covering the top and rear chassis of a compact body , whose sealing has been severely tested against moisture and dust. The D7000 is ready to shoot indoors and out , and at 150 , 000 cycles tested , the cameras durable shutter unit helps you keep shooting. Combine all this with the unmatched NIKKOR lens lineup and Creative Lighting System and you have everything you need to explore your imagination to its fullest. Where can creative freedom like this take you? Find out , with the D7000. High Resolution 16.2 MP DX - format CMOS sensor High Speed 6 frames per second continuous shooting up to 100 shots Breathtaking Full 1080p HD Movies with Full Time Autofocus Dynamic ISO range from 100 to 6400 Ground - breaking 2 , 016 - pixel RGB ( 3D Color Matrix ) exposure sensor Customizable 39 point AF System EXPEED 2 image processing and 14 - bit A / D Conversion Compact but durable with magnesium - alloy top and rear covers , superior weather and dust seals Bright Glass Pentaprism Optical Viewfinder with approx. 100% frame coverage 3 Inch , 921 , 000 - dot Super - Density LCD Monitor with 170 degree viewing Twin Card Slots with SD , SDHC , SDXC memory card compatibility Fast Start - Up time of 0.13 sec and Short 50ms Shutter Lag Built - in Speedlight flash with i - TTL and Wireless Commander support Compact EN - EL15 Battery lets you shoot up to 1050 shots Optional MB - D11 multi - power doubles shooting time Built - in HDMI Connection Two User Definable Settings ( U1 , U2 ) right on the Mode Selector Dial Active D - Lighting Picture Control Versatile Scene Modes Virtual Horizon Graphic Indicator Stunning Image Details : 16.2 Effective Megapixels Whether you want to make large prints or crop tightly in an image , the D7000 delivers the resolution you need. At its heart is a DX - format CMOS image sensor with 16.2 effective megapixels , optimally engineered to gather more quality light through sharp NIKKOR lenses. Coupled with 14 - bit A / D conversion ( 12 - bit selectable ), the D7000 produces stunning images that are richer in tone and detail than previously possible in DX format. The A / D conversion happens within the sensor , thereby maintaining exceptional image integrity without sacrificing shooting speed or energy efficiency. Combine these with the agile DX format and its signature 1.5x focal length telephoto potential and you can begin to see where this kind of shooting power can take you. Improved Image Quality And Speed : EXPEED 2 Image Processing Engine Sometimes you want to capture the subtle tones of a sunset. Other times you want to freeze the action. The D7000 delivers both , thanks to the newest generation of image processing engine , EXPEED 2 , which performs multiple tasks with more speed and power. Expect smoother tonal gradations , even in difficult shadows and highlights , for a greater sense of depth in your images. Shoot continuously at 6 frames per second so you can capture the action youve been missing. Focusing performance such as face recognition in Live View mode is also further improved , letting you concentrate on your composition. Standard ISO 100 to 6400 , Expandable to ISO 25600 Equivalent With improved pixel quality of the image sensor comes a wider ISO range from the DX - format  ISO 100 to 6400 has now become standard with the D7000 , enabling you to handle a wider range of lighting situations : from the bright and sunny outdoors to low - lit evenings and interiors. Nikons renowned noise reduction technology has been upgraded even further. Throughout the range , the D7000 delivers sharp images with minimized color noise. And thanks to the higher processing speed , even when High ISO noise reduction is activated , you can keep shooting continuously without stress. Quality high - ISO performance can also enhance a lot for movie shooting , allowing you to capture the mood of a scene using only available light. Capture Full HD 1080p D - Movie With Full - Time Autofocus And Manual Exposure The D7000 welcomes in a new era of movie capture : Full HD 1080p and movie editing functions for exceptional cinematic reproduction and quality. In addition to smooth - moving images , the camera can compensate for distortion and other image - degrading problems. Besides auto exposure mode , the D7000 offers manual exposure mode , which locks in the exposure value when shooting scenes with varying contrast levels , such as when panning from a bright window to a dark interior. Aside from a built - in monaural microphone , the D7000 incorporates an external microphone jack for high - quality stereo sound recording options. Improved Quality In Highlight And Shadow : Active D - Lighting Nikons exclusive Active D - Lighting offers the ability to preserve details in the highlights and shadowy areas of images shot in high - contrast scenes. Whether youre dealing with bright skies and a dark foreground or deep shadows where you cant use a flash , the EXPEED 2 image processing engine renders those scenes with smoother tones  even at its highest settings. Simply select Auto in Active D - Lighting mode and the camera can adjust to the scenes contrast levels or bracket them into three frames of varying strength levels. Even when Active D - Lighting is activated , you can still maintain the continuous shooting rate. Now Even More Precise : The Scene Recognition System The D7000 incorporates a built - in exposure - metering sensor with a far larger pixel count than any other D - SLR camera before it. The 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor reads the scenes brightness and colors more accurately , and then applies this reading to optimize not only exposure , but also autofocus , white balance and i - TTL flash calculations  all in mere milliseconds prior to the actual exposure. With more pixels , the D7000 can recognize even smaller subjects  both moving and stationary. The newly improved Scene Recognition System delivers better photographs in every way. Wide - Area Coverage , Powerful 39 - Point AF The D7000s strategically positioned 39 AF points cover a significantly wide area of the frame , giving you flexible compositional possibilities. The nine AF points in the center utilize powerful cross - type sensors  especially useful when you need tack - sharp focus such as with portraits and macro work. And unlike other manufacturers systems , the D7000s nine cross - type sensors work with all AF NIKKOR lenses f / 5.6 or faster. The D7000 offers a variety of AF area modes , including dynamic - area AF using 9 , 21 , 39 points. Switch between the three , depending on the predictability of your subjects movement , and the selected AF point and surrounding points will track your intended subject automatically. There is also 3D tracking , which continuously follows moving subjects within the 39 AF points , indicating the activated AF point in the viewfinder. Utilizing Nikons Scene Recognition System , Auto - area AF properly judges the main subject within 39 AF points and focuses on it. Therefore , no matter what the situation or composition calls for , the D7000s autofocus system will be ready to meet your focus needs. 39 - point AF & 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor Stay focused on what matters most Sophisticated AE With Highlight Analysis After the incredibly accurate 2016 - pixel RGB sensor reads a scenes lighting information such as brightness and colors , the D7000 cross - references what it sees with imaging data from 30 , 000 real - world shooting situations. This way , the renowned 3D Color Matrix Metering II delivers exposure results that are faithful to how you see light and shadow interplay , even in difficult lighting situations. This intelligent metering technique also delivers exceptionally accurate i - TTL flash exposures , and it all happens within milliseconds for both speed and precision. Informed Auto White Balance ( AWB ) Based on its massive collection of shooting data compiled from various light sources , the D7000s intelligent AWB algorithm renders white as truly white  even when shot under a wide range of light sources , including the difficult mercury vapor lighting. The D7000 also carries another AWB mode that maintains incandescent warmth in your images. Contrast AF for live view and D - Movie Live View and D - Movie users can rejoice , because with the D7000 , face - priority AF is now faster and more powerful than ever. Up to 35 people can be. For moving subjects such as pets , subject - tracking AF keeps them in focus. Normal - area AF is recommended for pinpoint focus and wide - area AF for handheld shooting. All are effective both for Live View shooting and movie recording. 6 Frames Per Second Shooting up to 100 Images Say farewell to missed opportunities. The D7000 incorporates a new driving mechanism to conduct its remarkably fast and precise mirror movements , giving you an approx. 0.052 second release time lag and an approx. 0.13 second start - up time. Whats more , you can continuously shoot at approx. 6 frames per second at both 14 - bit and 12 - bit A / D conversion for RAW shooting.

Nikon engineers paid meticulous attention to where exterior parts join by employing durable sealing against moisture and dust. The compact body has also undergone severe environmental tests to prove its rugged reliability. Approx. 100% Frame Coverage Viewfinder With approximately 100% frame coverage in the viewfinder , what you see is what you exactly capture. The specially coated glass pentagonal prism and precision - crafted finder screen offer not only a bright viewfinder image , but also enable you to easily confirm when a subject is in focus. Precision and durability : 150 , 000 cycles tested shutter unit The D7000 has a shutter speed range of 1 / 8000 to 30 seconds , with a top flash synchronization speed of 1 / 250 second.

LCD monitor The D7000 features an expansive 3 - in. VGA LCD monitor with reinforced glass. Its approx. 921k - dot resolution assures clear , detailed display of images , which proves invaluable when confirming focus or assessing image sharpness. The wide 170° viewing angle and bright display make it easy to review images or confirm menu settings when shooting outdoors. Electronic Virtual Horizon Especially useful for landscape shooting , the virtual horizon indicated in the LCD lets you know when the camera is level. The virtual horizon can also be displayed during Live View shooting. Twin Sd Card Slots ( cards not included ) Two memory card slots offer a number of advantages : sequential recording ; recording the same images simultaneously on two cards ; recording RAW and JPEG separately onto two different cards ; and duplicating images from one card to another. Its also possible to designate a specific card with more memory for use at the time of movie recording. Intelligent Power Management After carefully scrutinizing every aspect of the cameras circuitry , Nikon engineers have designed the D7000 for maximum performance with minimized power usage.

The flash is fully compatible with the Nikon Creative Lighting System ( CLS ) and delivers well - balanced flash exposures thanks to the innovative i - TTL flash control. The built - in flash also offers Commander mode to trigger remote flash units when using Advanced Wireless Lighting. The dual advantages for i - TTL technology and wireless capability make sophisticated remote flash control simple and inspiring. One simple remote flash from the side using the SB - 900 , SB - 700 or SB - 600 creates more texture , dimension and mood in ways that available light cannot. For more sophisticated creative effects , the small and intelligent SB - 700 has been designed to make the control of remote multiple flashes even easier.

The fact that the PowerShot SX260 HS digital camera is an ultra - slim camera with a powerful 20x optical zoom optical image stabilization ( Intelligent IS ) and 25mm wide - angle lens is only the beginning of its attractions. Youll see detail you never thought possible through the huge zoom and wide - angle lens while the cameras 12.1 megapixel high - sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 image processor deliver the rich clear low - light performance that is the hallmark of Canons HS SYSTEM. 1080p Full HD video in stereo is more beautiful than ever with new high - resolution high - speed processing. Sophisticated advancements include improved Smart AUTO that optimizes settings for 58 predefined shooting situations Face ID that prioritizes pre - registered faces and GPS for tracking and recording your shooting locations. Key Features : Ultra - slim Camera with powerful 20x Optical Zoom Optical Image Stabilization and 25mm Wide - Angle Lens At just over 1 1 / 4 inches thick the PowerShot SX260 HS is an ultra - slim digital camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom. But because its lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics its advantages go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25mm - 500mm ( 35mm equivalent ) the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes with details youve never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization. Optical Image Stabilizer Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake making photos and videos blurry. Canons Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens - shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations : outdoors at dusk inside without a flash and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds accommodating more low - light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced you get a sharper steadier image. And because it is an optical system there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers. UA Lens Technology Pioneered by Canon UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra - high refractive index in aspherical lens elements Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting - edge Canon optics UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket - friendly and capable of astounding image quality. Canon HS SYSTEM The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low - light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras : a high - sensitivity imaging sensor which is able to capture more light ; and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor which actively reduces noise with high - speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX260 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur. Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor The latest - generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i - Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural - looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source the new Canon Multi - Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed for example for the main subject and the background.

The EOS 7D features a Canon - designed 18.0 Megapixel APS - C size CMOS sensor that captures such a high level of resolution it's easy to crop images for enlargement without concern of losing detail. A major factor in reducing noise , the CMOS sensor assures that images shot at highest sensitivity will be remarkably smooth. Dual DIGIC 4 Image Processors ensure that images are captured , processed and saved with remarkable speed. The EOS 7D's ability to capture and process data of images shot at 18.0 Megapixels at 8 fps , as well as Face Detection Live Mode , Full HD video recording , Auto Lighting Optimizer and Lens Peripheral optimization are all possible thanks to the Dual DIGIC 4 Image Processors. Low Light Excellence. ISO 100 - 6400 ( expandable to 12 , 800 ) for shooting from bright to dim light. With a broad range of ISO settings , the EOS 7D enables shooting from dawn through dusk and ensures capture of the finest detail. With enhanced , low - noise high - sensitivity optimization , shooting in situations previously possible only with flash becomes as simple as point and shoot. The Speed You Need. 8.0 fps continuous shooting up to 126 Large / JPEGs with UDMA CF card and 15 RAW. Capable of shooting up to 126 Large / JPEGs with a UDMA CF card and 15 RAW at 8 fps , the EOS 7D is a perfect camera for action. Canon's remarkable shutter , combined with speedy , sophisticated electronics , ensures instant response and performance. A rapidly - occurring scene can be captured moment by moment , second by second , so that even the briefest of opportunities are captured in perfect clarity. HD Dreams Come True. Advanced movie mode with manual exposure control and selectable frame rates : 1920 x 1080 ( Full HD ): 30p ( 29.97 ) / 24p ( 23.976 ) / 25p , 1280 x 720 ( HD ): 60p ( 59.94 ) / 50p , 640 x 480 ( SD ): 60p ( 59.94 ) / 50p. Boasting the most advanced EOS movie capturing features to date , the EOS 7D does not just shoot video clips , it offers the enhanced image quality , smooth frame rates and adaptive exposure compensation necessary in a professional movie - making tool. By shooting video with a large sensor camera , it's simple to take advantage of the image characteristics intrinsic to SLR photography and not necessarily to video cameras. In addition to a number of different recording size and frame rate modes , the EOS 7D enables easy manual control of exposure , focus and Live View features and even allows for in - camera editing. The large CMOS sensor and compatibility with over 60 lenses provide a wealth of depth - of - field options. And it's all as easy as the press of a button � the EOS 7D has a dedicated Live View / Movie Recording lever with a start / stop button that gets the shooting started fast. Three Recording Sizes Full HD Video is captured at 1920 x 1080 resolution at 30p ( 29.97 ), 24p ( 23.976 ) or 25p frames per second , for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as .MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD with HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 ( 50p / 60p ( 59.94 ) fps ) or SD / VGA at 640 x 480 ( 50p / 60p ( 59.94 ) fps ) . Spectacular eye - level view. Intelligent Viewfinder with 100% field of view , wide viewing angle of 29.4 degrees , high magnification of 1.0 , intelligent viewfinder with glass pentaprism and an overlaid LCD display in viewfinder supports various shooting styles. The EOS 7D features a phenomenal redesigned viewfinder that not only offers 100 percent coverage , 1x magnification , a 29.4� angle of view and user - controlled dioptric adjustment , it also features a newly - designed transparent LCD display which enables a number of viewfinder displays to be overlaid at the touch of a button. Whereas with other cameras the representation of AF points and metering areas are static , with the EOS 7D , they can be displayed , adjusted and hidden , in camera , with ease. This means less distraction and more clarity to view the image in its entirety. Display options include : grid , spot metering , AF points display , hide all , zone AF , spot ( single - point ) AF , AF point expansion and Dual Axis Electronic Level display. The EOS 7D even features a brilliant new Dual Axis Electronic Level and tilt display that aids in achieving perfectly level shots , displaying both roll and pitch in 1� increments , either in the viewfinder or on the LCD. Faster , More Accurate AF. New 19 - point , all cross - type AF system equipped with dual diagonal cross - type sensors in center at f / 2.8 and f / 5.6 and AF area selection modes to match various shooting situations. Canon packed its most advanced technologies into the EOS 7D's AF system. With 19 high - precision , cross - type AF sensors , any of which can be selected automatically or manually , the EOS 7D is equipped to handle even the trickiest of focus situations with ease. The high - speed microcomputers in the EOS 7D use advanced algorithms that help ensure the fastest , most accurate AF performance under the widest variety of conditions. In addition , Canon's Light Source detection AF automatically compensates the focus by taking into account artificial lighting sources and making appropriate adjustments and the EOS 7D's new Intelligent Macro focusing tracks the object or the camera's movement when shooting close - up , to ensure focus is never lost. AF modes can be customized to suit the situation , ensuring reliable focus , every time. More Information Ensures Accurate Exposure. iFCL Metering with 63 zone dual - layer metering sensor that utilizes AF and color information for optimizing exposure and image quality. The EOS 7D features a new , 63 zone dual - layer sensor designed to complement the 19 - point AF system. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points , this new system delivers an entirely new level of accuracy for better results even in difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function , exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized ; the EOS 7D gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes , such as in a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS 7D ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes ; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background , and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot. Built to Perform. Magnesium body with shutter durability up to 150 , 000 cycles and exclusive dust and weather resistance. The EOS 7D is constructed of the highest quality materials , to exacting standards to ensure unfettered performance at all times. For example , the shutter can shoot at speeds up to 1 / 8000 sec. for 150 , 000 cycles ; the chassis is built of lightweight and rigid magnesium , and the camera's seals are built to resist water and dust. This combination makes the EOS 7D ready for anything.   Imaging Resolution Effective : 19.0MP , Recorded : 18.0MP Sensor 22.3mm x 14.9mm CMOS Bit Depth 14 - bit File Formats JPEG , RAW , QuickTime File Size Not</DIV></DIV>

From image capture to processing , Nikons comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture - taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine ; it is a revolution in digital photography. Four advanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results Nikon's Electronic VR image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. ISO 3200 capability allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast - moving subjects. And , Nikons original BSS ( Best Shot Selector ) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus. * The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image. Intelligent automation contributes to carefree shooting Nikons Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot , and this makes it faster and easier to capture the moment in beautiful fashion. The COOLPIX S3000 uses this intelligent function to analyze the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results  Portrait , Landscape , Night Portrait , Night Landscape , Close - up , or Backlight. Nikons exclusive Smart Portrait System Automatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot , Face - priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the priority subject smiles and offers the Blink Proof function , which automatically shoots two sequential frames and saves the one in which the subjects eyes are open - wide. Now featuring faster processing speed , In - Camera Red - Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red - eye effect before saving the image to memory. Subject Tracking Subject tracking automatically detects a human face and then continues to track and focus on that subject. Particularly useful when capturing children as they move naturally , Subject Tracking even functions if the subject moves out of the frame and returns within three seconds. Nikon COOLPIX S3000 Other Features 16 scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings Scene Auto Selector D - Lighting Auto Sort function Up to 1.6 hours* of movie shooting at 640 x 480 ( 30 fps ) Quick Retouch Approx. 47 MB of internal memory USB charging via Charging AC Adapter EH - 68P / EH - 68P ( AR ) or PC * Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes , or after the file size reaches 2 GB.

Whether the action is fast or slow , close up or far away , you'll always get the shot you want with the PowerShot SX10 IS. This camera puts you on the cutting edge of advanced technology , with an incredibly powerful 20x Optical Zoom , 10 - megapixel resolution , and new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high - performance face and motion detection. Powerful Zoom , True - to - Life Imaging. Stay close to the action with a 20x Optical Zoom , wide - angle lens and Optical Image Stabilizer. Improved speed and quiet zooming means you never have to miss a shot. The PowerShot SX10 IS is equipped with a 20x Optical Zoom lens with a focal length of 5.0 - 100mm ( 35mm film equivalent : 28 - 560mm ) that allows you to shoot any scene from wide - angle to telephoto. The camera uses a VCM ( Voice Coil Motor ) for high - speed , quiet , energy - efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. The lens is optimized to fully exploit its zoom length and wide shooting angle in concert with the camera's high 10.0 - megapixel resolution. UD glass effectively suppresses chromatic aberration , while enhanced negative refractive power ensures that distortion at the wide - angle is also corrected. Further aberration is controlled with the inclusion of a double - sided aspherical glass - molded lens and ultra - high refraction index lens. The SX10 IS is equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake - one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in , you can get the steady , crisp , brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. Value to Spare. Powerful 10.0 Megapixel resolution for greater printing and editing. The PowerShot SX10 IS is equipped with many of the same features as a higher - end camera : an ultra - powerful zoom , eye - popping resolution and advanced picture - improving technology. 10.0 megapixels of resolution give your photography incomparable depth and ensure that any section of any shot can be enlarged and cropped with no loss in quality when you edit the image and even in large printout. It creates crisp , clear 13" x 19" posters. A Big Vari - Angle LCD Shows Details. Large 2.5 - inch Vari - angle LCD for flexible viewing at nearly every angle , plus a viewfinder for more shooting options.

Clear and bright , it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close - up with Super Macro shooting mode. A World of Advantages With Canon's New Technology. New DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection , adds Servo AF , Face Detection Self - Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction for greater flexibility. DIGIC 4 Image Processor Canon's proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition , and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster , more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality , even at high ISO speeds. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A new Face Self - Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , and specify Face Self - Timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also , Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot SX10 IS can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) The Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The SX10 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the SX10 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. New Video Format Brings Better Image Quality. MovieSnap mode lets you capture high - resolution still images while shooting a movie. Improved movie format for longer movie lengths. With Movie Snap , you'll never miss a perfect still shot just because you're in the middle of shooting a movie. Simply press the shutter to record a high - resolution still. The PowerShot SX10 IS supports the MOV video format which reduces data volume by approximately 60%. This allows you to record longer movies while maintaining optimal image quality. Instant Creative Control. A wide range of shooting modes to capture anything. Now you're free to concentrate on what really counts - your subject. With the large , simple - to - operate Mode Dial , all you have to do is turn to the setting that best matches the scene you're viewing through the lens. The PowerShot SX10 IS does the rest. It chooses the perfect exposure , aperture and flash. Or , if you want to flex your creative muscles , choose Manual Control and do it all yourself.

Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well - detailed , clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system , including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full - resolution , quickened AF speeds , and full HD 1080p video recording in multiple frame rates with manual exposure and audio level control. Serving to benefit working with live view in both still and movie shooting modes , Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a powerful technology that revolves around the incorporation of two photodiodes within each pixel to provide an expansive phase - detection focusing system. This system affords focusing advantages that are similar to how a camcorder works and as such can focus on subjects in an incredibly fast and precise manner. The benefits of this system are three - fold : the ability to focus quickly and smoothly ; the ability to truly utilize the vari - angle touchscreen LCD monitor to its full potential ; and the ability to utilize a wide range of over 100 EF and EF - S lenses. Also benefiting from Dual Pixel CMOS AF is the Movie Servo AF mode , which enables continuous auto focusing when recording movies. This focusing mode is especially useful for maintaining critical focus on moving subjects and for realizing the near - silent performance of compatible STM lenses. The 3.0" 1 , 040k - dot vari - angle Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari - angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti - reflective , smudge - resistant coating allows for clear well - detailed viewing. In addition to the LCD monitor , the 70D also features an optical pentaprism finder that can be used for eye - level shooting of still images. This Intelligent Viewfinder incorporates a superimposed LCD to provide an intuitive means for monitoring exposure and camera settings during shooting. While working with the viewfinder , an expansive 19 - point all cross - type AF system is visualized for acquiring focus ; integral to this array is a high - precision dual - cross center AF point that is compatible with f / 2.8 and faster lenses. Providing a wealth of additional functionality to the camera is integrated Wi - Fi connectivity , which allows instant and direct sharing of image files to an iOS or Android mobile device for sharing online. This functionality also allows for wireless remote control over camera settings , including exposure controls , focusing , and shutter release , from a mobile device when using the Canon</DIV></DIV>

Motion Deblur Mode When trying to record children or pets in a dimly lit room , have you ever missed to capture a smiling face or a special moment because your subject moved , causing the image to blur?With the DMC - ZS10 , the Motion Deblur Mode* prevents blurring with even greater power.This mode integrates the Intelligent ISO Control , which automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed according to the subject's movement , and the advanced contrast control system of Intelligent Exposure , which also optimizes the exposure to prevent over / under - exposed parts in the image. The camera judges the appropriate shutter speed to suppress motion blur according to the subject's movement. The shutter speed rises as high as possible activating the high sensitivity recording by pixel mixed readout method.The camera determines the optimal settings , so anyone can easily capture crisp , clear photos - without blurring. Intelligent ISO Control - Motion Detection The Intelligent ISO Control function detects subject movement and automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the movement and light conditions. When it detects subject motion , it automatically raises the ISO setting and increases the shutter speed to prevent motion blur. On the other hand , when the subject is still and no movement is detected , it takes beautifully natural photos with a low ISO setting. Intelligent Exposure - Light Detection The Intelligent Exposure instantly analyzes the framed image and adjusts the brightness in areas that are too dark due to dim lighting , backlighting or use of the flash. Adjusting the brightness of dark areas , this produces natural images that are close to the way they actually look to the human eye. Intelligent Burst Mode The Intelligent Burst Shooting is available on the DMC - ZS10. It automatically sets the frame rate of burst shooting according to the subject's movement - whether it moves fast or slow - utilizing the mechanism of Intelligent ISO Control. The DMC - ZS10 features the Quick AF. Ordinary AF is activated when the shutter button is pressed half - way , while the Quick AF starts operating as soon as the camera is pointed toward a subject. This dramatically reduces the shutter delay time and lets you take images quickly. Its super - fast focus is ideal for capturing quick images of active children and pets. By setting the camera to the Quick AF , images of sudden shooting opportunities won't be out of focus or blurry. Face Detection AF / AE with Face Recognition The DMC - ZS10 features the Face Recognition , a function that remembers faces. The conventional face detection system captures a face with focus and appropriate exposure but sometimes it falls not on the face you want to capture most beautifully when there are several faces in a frame. The Face Recognition prioritizes focus and exposure right on the face of your special person. In playback , you can choose to display only photos that contain a specific registered face using the Category Playback.The Face Detection also features the Digital Red - eye Correction ( Red - eye Removal ) . The camera takes care of the red - eye effect that often happens when shooting with a flash , to ensure attractive facial expression. Intelligent Scene Selector - Scene Detection When the camera's in the iA Mode , the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to one of Scenery , Portrait , Macro , Night Portrait , Night Scenery , Sunset or Intelligent Handheld Nightshot. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance. You are free from annoying settings every time scene changes when taking images with these most frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results even before you know it.

So whether youre photographing flowers a captivating sunset or your friends at the park you can be confident that youre getting dramatic memorable images. Creative Scene Modes Such as Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect The Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH offers creative effects similar to those found in certain professional lenses. Miniature Effect creates an illusion where very large objects appear in miniature proportions. Turn soaring cityscapes into a scene in seemingly dollhouse - like proportions. Fisheye Effect uses barrel distortion to warp the image around the center giving a distinctive curvature effect to the photo. The curvilinear images produced by Fisheye Effect can suggest the curve of the Earth the inside of a dome or the image you see through the peephole of a door. Smart Shutter Automatically Takes a Picture When the Subject Smiles or Winks Smart Shutter which includes Smile Self - Timer Wink Self - timer and Face Self - timer detects faces in the scene and releases the shutter automatically in response to the appearance of an additional face or when a smile or sassy wink occurs. These technologies take the guesswork out of your photography allowing you to focus solely on your subject and get the perfect shot. DIGIC 4 Image Processor Enables accurate color renditions and fast image processing times. Shoot in Low Light Mode for Dimly Lit Situations With an ISO of 400 - 6400 the Low Light mode takes the Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS boldly into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light such as those lit by candles fire or street lamp come through in fantastic color and clarity with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. AF / AE / FE / WB Face Detection and Intelligent Contrast Correction For optimized portraits and better overall picture quality regardless of your subject matter.</DIV></DIV>

Blink Detection alerts a shooter after a shot has been taken that a subject had closed eyes. Blinking subjects can ruin the best shots , and the problem usually isn't detected until it's too late to do anything about it. The PowerShot SX200 IS is equipped with Canon's new Blink Detection to combat this common image flaw. The feature uses the power of Face Detection to determine whether any subject in the previous shot had closed eyes. If closed eyes are detected , a "blink warning" icon appears for 3 seconds , allowing you to re - take the shot before your subject or subjects move on. Large 3.0 - inch LCD ( 230 , 000 dots ) with high resolution and wide viewing angle. The camera's high resolution ( 230 , 000 dots ) 3.0 - inch LCD with gives you the big picture , whether you're shooting , reviewing or showing off your images.

Clear and bright , it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close - up with Super Macro shooting mode. DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self - timer. Canon's most advanced image processor , DIGIC 4 , delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you're ready to shoot , then delivers perfect focus. In addition , exposure , flash and white balance are compensated , so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A Face Detection Self - timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include the photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , specify Face Detection Self - timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot SX200 IS can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The PowerShot SX200 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SX200 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode.</DIV></DIV>

Expanding on their GF3 , Panasonic has created a camera with DSLR - like quality and responsiveness in a compact , easy to use form , complete with the latest touch screen navigation and Full HD video. This GF5 kit includes the camera body and a high speed 14 - 42mm ( equivalent to 28 - 84mm in 35mm format ) lens.  A newly developed 12.1 megapixel Live MOS sensor and the Lumix Venus Engine image processor are the foundations on which this advanced yet understandable camera are built. The Micro Four Thirds standard allows this camera to be mirrorless and therefore compact while maintaining high resolution and aspect ratio options. The interchangeable lens system provides a full creative palette to expand shooting capabilities well past the realm of standard compact cameras. Combining the strengths of its sensor and image processor , the GF5 offers high speed and image quality , particularly noticeable in low light conditions. The noise that shows up as bland , "pixely" shadows and highlights in other cameras has been significantly reduced due to on - chip filters in the sensor and Panasonic's excellent noise reduction system. This system eliminates noise throughout the image processing stages , even at the incredibly higher sensitivity ( ISO 12 , 800! )  that the GF5 offers.  Photodiode and readout circuits and the newly added NR ( Noise Reduction ) circuit combine with the Venus Engine's 3DNR and MNR to keep images sharp even at high speeds and low light ; the optimal balance of high resolution and low noise. To compete with the speed of bulky DSLR's , the compact Lumix GF5 has enhanced its sensor and auto - focus systems. The Live MOS sensor features high sensitivity signal processing and the auto - focus systems have been revamped for improved accuracy and speed. Adopting the Contrast - AF system , the GF5 incorporates Full - area focusing and pre - touch focusing. In other words , you can focus on any point in the field of view with a simple tap on the touch screen and in Quick AF mode , your camera will start focusing before you do. Added advancements include the AF+MF function , which allows manual focus to work with auto - focus for exact precision and Pinpoint AF , which lets you enlarge the focusing area on the LCD to place focus on a point as tiny as a bug on a flower or the pupil of an eye. The new 3" LCD Touch Display is a significant step - up for the GF5. The 920K - dot high precision display and GUI ( Graphic User Interface ) transform this camera into a touch responsive system in which focusing and camera operation as well as image management and menu navigation are made simple and clear.</DIV></DIV>

The combination of these two technologies affords a high sensitivity level of ISO 51200 , full - resolution continuous shooting rate of 6 fps , and renders both still images and videos with notable image quality and clarity. Full HD 1080p video recording is supported in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps as well as HD 720p recording up to 60 fps. Video files are recorded in the high quality H.264 AVC / MPEG - 4 codec and saved as .MOV files for easier sharing and editing. When recording video or making still imagery with live view , a 3.0" 921k - dot LCD monitor is available and provides a wide viewing angle for improved viewing in a variety of shooting positions. Benefitting the image quality is the SAFOX IXi+ autofocus system , which works to ensure sharp , accurate focus quickly and smoothly. Additionally , when working with manual focus , focus peaking is available to provide a more objective and comparable method of acquiring critical focus. Also contributing to image sharpness is in - camera sensor shift image stabilization , which reduces the appearance of camera shake by about three shutter speed steps when working in low - light conditions or with longer focal length lenses. For extensive control over image - making , in - camera RAW ( DNG ) image processing is available as well as HDR shooting capabilities. For expediting control over the most oft - used functions of the K - 50 , both the front and rear e - dials are customizable and can be programmed to control an array of exposure settings and camera functions. For creatively modifying imagery in - camera , a variety of filters , scene modes , and auto modes are available to enhance the look and feel of imagery prior to post - processing. In addition to the range of automatic camera settings , traditional manual shooting modes are also available , such as program , shutter - priority , aperture - priority , sensitivity - priority , and manual. All of the K - 50's technologies are housed within a polycarbonate - covered camera body that is supported by a stainless steel chassis. This body design is fully weather - sealed and protects the camera from moisture and dust as well as extreme temperatures from 14 - 104°. Additionally , the design of the camera allows the use of either the standard lithium - ion battery pack or four AA batteries as its power source when used in conjunction with the optional D - BH109 AA Battery Holder. Included with the K - 50 camera body is the smc Pentax DA 18 - 55mm f / 3.5 - 5.6 AL WR lens , which provides a 35mm - equivalent focal length of 27.0 - 82.5mm , covering wide - angle to portrait - length perspectives to suit working in a wide variety of situations. The lens construction integrates aspherical elements to help minimize chromatic</DIV></DIV>

It also delivers a number of other innovative functions , including the ability to capture a still image while viewing the movement of the subject in slow motion and automatically selecting and saving one frame from continuous shots. The Exilim EX - FS10 measures just 3.8 inches wide , 2.3 inches high and .64 inches thin. It features a newly - developed 3x optical inner - zoom lens and a 2.5 - inch high - performance Super Clear LCD. This high - speed model also boasts an effective 9.1 - megapixel resolution. Casio Exilim EX - FS10 Highlights 30 shot - per - second high - speed burst shooting The EX - FS10 can take up to 30 shots per second of high - resolution 6.0 - megapixel images. Whats more , it can save up to 25 frames prior to the instant that the shutter button is actually pressed , so even if the user hits the shutter a bit late , that special moment will not be missed. The number of shots per second can be set at 30 , 15 , 10 , 5 , 3 or auto , and the user can set the total number of shots in one burst at 30 , 20 , 10 or 5. Easy , convenient functions that make the most of high - speed burst shooting Automatically record just the best of the images captured in a high - speed burst. Also , a number of images from a burst can be combined into a single image. It is this high - speed burst capability that offers the functionality for easily creating photos precisely in accordance with the wishes of the user. After taking a set of shots , there is no need to go to the trouble of manually select the best one. Slow Motion View By pressing a dedicated button during shooting , it is possible to view the movement of the subject in slow motion on the LCD monitor. The user can press the shutter while viewing the LCD monitor , selecting the perfect moment to capture from a scene that looks as if time has been slowed down. High - Speed Anti - Shake and High - Speed Night Scene functions Combine a number of images taken in burst mode , and then align the position of the subject to form a single shot. This means that , even without a tripod , zoom photography and night shots are beautifully rendered , virtually making photo blur a thing of the past. High - Speed Best Selection To ensure that a natural , fleeting smile is captured , the FS10 can automatically select the best image from a set of images taken in burst mode , with the subject smiling , with no photo blur , and with the subjects eyes open. The best image will be saved. High - speed movie recording at up to 1 , 000 fps The FS10 features a high - speed movie function that can record motion that is ordinarily too fast for the human eye to see , and then play it back in ultra - slow motion. The frame rate can be set at 1000 fps , 420 fps or 210 fps. Also , even while recording a movie clip at the standard speed ( 30 fps ), by pressing a single button the frame rate can be changed to the 210 fps high - speed mode. HD Movie function The HD Movie function will record beautiful videos at a size of 1280x720 pixels. Also , pressing the dedicated photo button while shooting an HD movie clip will capture a 6.0 - megapixel still image. Lag Correction You can set in advance the time lag between the moment that you want to capture and the actual time of taking the picture. This way , it is possible to capture that precious instant at any time , with minimal lag. This works because the cameras select from the images they temporarily store in their burst mode buffers the one image that was taken at the specified interval prior to the shutter being released , and just that image is saved. Product Description The compact high - speed EX - FS10 camera is extremely slim , concealing amazing high - speed functions in its elegant , ultra - slim designer case for breath taking photos and film in every situation.

It functions perfectly with or without a flash. It's All About Capturing the Smiles - DIGIC III Image Processor with Genuine Canon Face Detection AF / AE / FE / WB sets the focus , exposure , flash and white balance automatically so you always capture the perfect face. DIGIC III Image Processor - With DIGIC III , your images boast superior quality , the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What's more , DIGIC III enables Canon's Face Detection , Motion Detection Technologies and Red - eye Correction to give you better , more true - to - life people shots. Simply press the shutter button halfway down , and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. The camera also selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings automatically to keep everything looking sharp and clear. Red - eye Correction can be handled in - camera , in two ways. The Red - eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red - eye from images as they're taken , before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red - eye during image playback , using simple settings in the SX110 IS's menu. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. DIGIC III features Face Detection technologies , giving you the best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF / AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene , eliminating the common problems of over and underexposed faces. Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets you highlight one face among several in a scene , and the camera concentrates on that person , even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's Motion Detection Technology. Simply press the Face Selector Button , then the selected face is double - framed and tracked when the face moves in the frame. Motion Detection Technology works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. It automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. This feature provides higher ISOs when you need it for action - stopping shutter speeds. But when no movement is detected , it sets lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SX110 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) The Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The SX110 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them.

And as far as compact cameras go , it's the closest thing to the anatomical wonder on the market. With an impressive F1.8 lens - one of the brightest available - the TL500 delivers a wider range of aperture steps and shallow depth - of - field , giving you the ability to blur out the background of your images while keeping the focus on your subjects. The high - end Schneider KREUZNACH lens offers a 24mm , ultra - wide focal length and 3x optical zoom so you're capturing as much of the landscape and as many of your friends as possible. High sensitivity. Low noise. Amazing photos. Trying to capture high - quality , low - noise images wimth lots of pixels and excellent light? The TL500 was engineered to do that exactly. With sensors larger than those typically found in compact digital cameras , the TL500's 1 / 1.7" CCD offers unrivaled sensitivity ( max ISO 3200 / full - resolution ), making it possible to capture ultra - vivid , natural - looking , professional photos , regardless of lighting conditions. Get creative from any angle with rotating AMOLED. With the TL500's 3" swiveling AMOLED screen , composing and reviewing images is easier - and more fun - than ever. The display rotates so you can frame your images exactly the way you want as well as shoot from just about any angle , including those tricky overhead and low - to - the - ground shots , giving you the freedom to take more artistic , expressive photos. And , compared to the usual TFT - LCD typically found on digital cameras , the TL500's AMOLED provides a higher contrast ratio , deeper blacks and more vivid colors , even when viewed from an angle or in direct sunlight. So you can fully visualize your final shot. Embrace both light and dark in one frame Don't let your photos be dominated by the dark or the light. The TL500's Smart Range ( High Dynamic Range ) feature lets you vividly express both bright areas and dark areas of your subject in the same frame. So bright spots aren't oversaturated and dark spots aren't too dark. Together with Samsung's super - fast DRIMeIII imaging processor , the TL500 helps you capture high - quality images in a variety of settings and extreme lighting conditions. Edit RAW files and express yourself. The TL500 was engineered to help you express yourself. Its Samsung converter program gives you the freedom to edit RAW files – files that contain uncompressed original data and are not yet processed – any way you want. Normally , images are processed and compressed into JPEG files using settings in the camera. But RAW file support gives you free reign. So whether its color , exposure difference or resolution , you can manipulate your images to your heart's content. Conveniently change settings without missing a beat. Great shots have to be caught in a split second. That's why the TL500 is equipped with a Front Wheel Key and Dual Dial. It lets you adjust your settings instantly so you don't miss the moment. Just rotate the dial to set the aperture and shutter speed or tune the white balance and color temperature. It's this convenient spin on manual control that will help you capture some of your most professional - looking images. Take control. Seize the moment When it comes to capturing life's greatest moments on film , hit - or - miss just isn't good enough. That's why Samsung's Full Manual Control lets you capture those moments you might otherwise miss out on in auto mode. Aperture Priority makes sure your main subject stands out from its surroundings , Sutter Priority captures fast movements , and Manual Mode grants you complete control of the exposure. Smart Filter Samsung's Smart Filter , lens effect , delivers an artistic edge to your still shots and videos. The Miniature filter gives your subjects a miniaturized look , the Vignetting filter delivers a strikingly strong compositional contrast , and our Fish - eye filter gives your video that cool distorted feel. So get creative and get Samsung. Smart Auto 2.0 ( Still & Movie ) Turn any moment into a perfect memory. And a professional - looking photo. Whether it's a few friends from last night's party or the moon reflecting off the lake , Smart Auto 2.0 ( Still & Movie ) instantly analyzes key elements of your composition then automatically adjusts to capture the perfect shot with multitude of different photo modes and movie modes. And since life isn't a still life , the camera's object tracking feature captures those subjects that just don't , or won't , stand still.

The newly developed LEICA DC VARIO - ELMARIT lens in the DMC - FZ40 extends its optical zoom range from 25mm to 24x , 600mm equivalent. The powerful 24x optical zoom* can increases its power to 32x equivalent with the Intelligent Zoom function taking advantage of the Intelligent Resolution technology maintaining the picture quality even using digital zoom. Combining Sonic Speed AF with a high - speed start - up gives the FZ40 the industry's fastest level of response which helps to catch even the most fleeting photo opportunities. The manual control of FZ40 elevates the operability even higher with the incorporation of new jog dial. A focus button lets users change its settings quickly according to the shooting condition. Users can enjoy creative shooting not only in photo but also in movie , utilizing a host of options including Creative Movie mode and My Color mode. *Equivalent to 35mm camera : 25 - 600mm. 25mm Ultra Wide - Angle LEICA DC VARIO - ELMARIT Lens with Powerful 24x Optical Zoom for Ultimate Versatility in Both Photo and Movie RecordingThe FZ40 features a high - quality LEICA DC VARIO - ELMARIT 25mm ultra wide - angle lens with a 24x optical zoom ( 35mm camera equivalent : 25 - 600mm ) . Comprising 14 elements in 10 groups , including 3 ED lenses and 2 aspherical lenses with 3 aspherical surfaces , this advanced lens unit realizes the outstandingly compact body while passing Leica's stringent standards to deliver exceptional optical performance suppressing distortion at wide end and color bleeding at tele end. Thanks to the newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology , the Intelligent Zoom is available with the FZ40 which extends the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x maintaining the picture quality even combining a digital zoom. This means the 24x optical can virtually extend to 32x equivalent. Furthermore , the Extra Optical Zoom function extends zoom power to 50.6x ( at 3 - megapixel resolution ) by using the center part of the large CCD to bring subjects even closer. Enjoy Easy Shooting of HD Movie in AVCHD Lite with Advanced iA ( Intelligent Auto ) Mode The DMC - FZ40 is capable of recording high quality HD Movie in AVCHD Lite. The AVCHD Lite feature almost doubles the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG and excels in the compatibility with TV and other AV equipment. The picture quality is greatly enhanced thanks to the Intelligent Resolution technology. The DMC - FZ40 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio. The Evolving iA ( Intelligent Auto ) Mode Makes Every Photo Blur - less Panasonic incorporated the Intelligent Auto mode in pursuit of the ultimate ease of operation and the reduction of misshots. In the iA mode , the camera does all the work , leaving you free to compose shots and capture moments. Just press , aim and shoot. The hand - shake component , which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed , is recognized as a low - frequency vibration , for which the new POWER O.I.S. is particularly effective. This greatly improves the quality of shots taken with high zoom and at night or indoors where a flash cannot be used , or where the photographer doesn't want to use a flash because it would spoil the mood. It captures beautiful photos in situations that previously resulted in blurring. The Face Recognition function remembers registered faces to give an appropriate AF / AE on the people while removing the unwanted red - eye. The Intelligent Scene Selector automatically selects whichever of 6 Scene modes - Macro , Portrait , Scenery , Night Portrait , Night Scenery and Sunset - that best suits the shooting situation. Intuitive Manual Control and Creative Option The excellent manual controllability is an advantage of DMC - FZ40 , making it stand out against standard compact cameras. The newly adopted jog dial enhances the operability together with the focus button on the back of the camera. In movie recording , the DMC - FZ40 goes further than simply recording HD movies. Apart from the movie recording capability of conventional digital compact cameras , the DMC - FZ40 also features a Creative Movie mode , which lets the user set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies , which is especially suitable for shooting fast - moving subject. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances and it is desired to have each of them stand out. My Color mode , which is popular in the LUMIX G Micro System cameras , is a special option that gives free reign to the user's creativity. With a variety of options including new Pin Hole , Film Grain , High Dynamic and High Dynamic B&W , the My Color mode makes it easier and more fun to create interesting , expressive images by shooting images with most intensive color , brightness and saturation parameters. The popular My Color mode is available also in movie recording giving the user a wider range of expressive possibilities to explore together with the Creative Movie mode.</DIV></DIV>

But as we grow older , we learn to color inside the lines , and have less and less time for art. We often lose touch with how satisfying it is to create something uniquely our own. Olympus delivers the E - 620 digital single lens reflex ( DSLR ) camera to bring back that free - style experimenting and the magical feeling of being inspired by our own art. The easy - to - use Art Filters and Multiple Exposures ( built right into the camera ) are fun for photographers -- whether youve been shooting for years or picked up your first digital camera today. Enjoy capturing creative images on the go -- without being tethered to a computer and editing software! Now it is possible to easily customize your images so theyre worthy of posting on the gallery wall ( or at least the family fridge ) . The E - 620's freedom of expression is matched by its freedom of mobility. First , the camera travels with you to more places , thanks to its compact size and light 18.9 - ounce body. Second , as the worlds smallest DSLR with in - body Image Stabilization , the E - 620 adjusts when your body moves to remove blur caused by camera shake ( with any lens attached ) . Finally , add Live View shooting with a swivel 2.7 - inch HyperCrystal LCD that frees you to cover subjects from a range of angles , and this 12.3 - megapixel DSLR seamlessly combines motions with emotions -- proof that Olympus lets you capture it all. Make Your Vision Come to Life with Art Filters If youre hoping to get more out of your camera than simply capturing and documenting a scene , and enjoy enhancing or customizing an image to make it your own , then you will value the cameras Art Filters. The filters , which are built into the camera , provide incredible individual artistic control over an image , and remove the need to spend time altering images on the computer with editing software. This camera was made for free - style shooting , experimenting and engaging with events and subjects. Enjoy the freedom of Autofocus Live View and dramatic effects to transform your day - to - day shots into compositions that you can be proud of with the following in - camera Art Filters : Pop Art : Enhances colors , making them more saturated and vivid , creating high - impact pictures that express the joyful , lighthearted feeling of the Pop Art style of the 1960s ; Soft Focus : Creates an ethereal , otherworldly atmosphere that renders subjects in a heavenly light without obscuring details ; Pale & Light Color : Encloses the foreground of an image in flat gentle light and pastel colors reminiscent of a flashback scene in a movie ; Light Tone : Renders shade and highlight areas softly to lend an elegant air to the subject ; Grainy Film : Evokes the feeling of documentary footage shot in monochrome with grainy , high - contrast film ; and Pin Hole : Reduces the peripheral brightness of an image as though it were shot through a pin hole , connecting the viewer intimately with the subject at the center of the picture. Art Filters are easily activated with the mode dial on the left side of the camera body. The effects are viewable right on the new cameras 100 percent accurate swivel 2.7 - inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD when using the E - 620 in Live View mode or when reviewing the captured image. Express Your Inner Artists Multiple Personalities With the new cameras Multiple Exposure function you are free to tell a visual story your way , whether in a portrait , a landscape or a combination of both. For instance , capture an image of the spring leaves on a new tree and then overlay an image of your childs face into the leaves for a stunning image that expresses the newness of the season. The image capture options allow you to shoot one shot , then another , or to capture both shots separately and combine them in the camera later. Or superimpose your own portrait with a starry night sky to create a photo with the impact you desire. Let your imagination lead you to new creative discoveries. Ready , Steady , Go with In - Body Image Stabilization The E - 620 travels with you to more places , thanks to its compact size and light 18.9 - ounce body. Capture sharp images on the go with the cameras in - body Image Stabilization , which virtually eliminates blur with any lens attached. Three IS modes handle any situation. The IS - 1 mode is for general shooting and adjusts the sensor on both the horizontal and vertical planes to compensate for movement by the photographer so images stay sharp in low light even at slow shutter speeds. To capture the motion of moving subjects , the E - 620 offers two specialized modes : IS - 2 mode is ideal for capturing a runner or cyclist traveling by in the horizontal mode , preserving the sense of motion while panning ; IS - 3 mode achieves the same effect when the camera is held vertically. In either mode , the artistic effects of panning enhance the shot and render the subject in sharp detail with blurred background. Moreover , the E - 620 is the worlds smallest DSLR with built - in Image Stabilization , so youll feel comfortable taking it on the road with you to capture the action. Superior Image Quality The new cameras high - performance 12.3 - megapixel Live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range , accurate color fidelity , and a state - of - the - art amplifier circuit to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas. Its Live MOS image sensor is complemented by Olympus TruePic III+ Image Processor , which produces clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible. The new image processor is noted for accurate natural color , true - to - life flesh tones , brilliant blue skies , and precise tonal expression ; it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings , enabling great results in low - light situations. Swivel Live View LCD : Freedom to Move You The new cameras 100 percent accurate 270 degree swivel 2.7 - inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD can be rotated freely so photographers can compose at any angle , including overhead and down low , without getting bent out of shape. This enables an E - 620 photographer to compose a subject in the Live View LCD and see the results of the various creative features -- live as theyre happening. When viewing the LCD in Live View , settings like white balance and exposure can also be selected , and their impact is seen instantly on the display. Real - time monitoring offers amazing versatility and creative control. The LCD displays 230 , 000 pixels in vivid color and includes HyperCrystal technology , which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors for easier viewing in both preview and playback. It also provides a wide viewing angle of 176 degrees , which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. The 2.7 - inch LCD makes icons and text on the cameras menu easy to view. Beyond the cameras bright viewable LCD , the E - 620 is equipped with illuminated buttons on its body that are easily viewable in low light to quickly find the settings you want. Two Fast Autofocus Systems Consumers accustomed to composing and focusing using a point - and - shoot cameras LCD will appreciate that the E - 620 offers the same easy , seamless experience ( what you see on its LCD is what you get! ) . The E - 620 delivers two fast autofocus options to quickly focus and capture the image in any situation : Fast Imager Autofocus in Live View : When it comes to measuring camera speed , autofocus is a key factor. If a cameras AF system does not meet photographers demands and lock focus accurately and quickly , its possible to miss a shot. AF Live View on the E - 620 allows you to compose , focus , and capture the shot quickly and easily without ever taking your eye off the large 2.7 - inch full color LCD. Phase Detection AF : When using the optical viewfinder , the technology behind the new 7 - point twin cross AF system provides world - class fast and accurate focusing based on the speed of the E - 3. Super sensitive Twin and Twin Cross AF target points can measure focus both vertically and horizontally , so regardless of the subject , focusing is super - simple and fast. With a dedicated Phase Detection AF sensor in the camera body , shooting moving subjects , like a runner crossing the finish line , is lightning fast. In low - light situations , this is the AF option of choice to quickly lock focus , so that a loved ones face illuminated only by candlelight is in sharp focus. Multi - Aspect Shooting Since photography is a form of expression that is essentially based on clipping a scene , framing is an important component of style. The E - 620 provides four aspect ratios that serve as masks to frame your image to the desired proportions , including : the standard 4 : 3 aspect ratio that is perfectly suited for an 8 x 10 - inch enlargement ; the 16 : 9 aspect ratio that will display your images beautifully on a widescreen television ; and other popular aspect ratios such as 3 : 2 and 6 : 6. By enabling you to select the aspect ratio before shooting and easily viewing it on the LCD throughout the shoot , the Multi - Aspect function offers a new way to control your photography and express yourself. Always Find a Face in the Crowd The new cameras Face Detection reduces the chance of blurred subjects in photography by distinguishing between peoples faces and the background. It tracks up to eight faces within the image area , even if people are moving , and automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for sharp , brilliant portrait pictures ( ideal for large family or party group photos ) . In Sunshine or the Shadows , Never Miss a Detail Shooting scenes with both highlights and shadows can be tricky because of the extreme contrast between dark and bright areas. The E - 620 addresses this challenge with Shadow Adjustment Technology that adjusts for extreme light variations and maintains visible detail in both the shadow and highlight areas of the scene. Now users can see and preview the gradation on the Live View LCD and capture images showing the shadow detail they saw. This feature is also accessible in the Edit menu after the shot has been taken. Preview a Multitude of Possibilities Perfect Shot Preview enables users to easily preview and select from a variety of thumbnail previews of the photographic effects of white balance and exposure compensation adjustments live on the LCD before taking the photograph. It is an ideal way for novice users to learn about the effects of different photography techniques , visually , without having to scroll through menu options. With 28 preset scene - select modes for every imaginable shooting scenario , automatic modes and full manual controls , the E - 620 offers a world of possibilities to photographers. Wireless Flash Capability Wireless flashes help you cast the best light on your subjects and capture great images. For this reason , the E - 620 is compatible with the Olympus FL - 36R and FL - 50R wireless electronic flashes that are designed exclusively for digital photography. When these flashes are used in combination with the E - 620 , multiple - wireless flash photography is both easy and reliable. The E - 620 can control up to three wireless flash groups independently , with multiple flash units in each group for dramatic flash effects. Dust Reduction System for Spot - Free Images Life moves too fast to spend time worrying about dust ruining the perfect image. Olympus proven Dust Reduction System produces spot - free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter. The patented ultrasonic technology vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor and captures it on a special adhesive membrane every time the camera is turned on. These spot - free photos liberate users from hours spent retouching photographs at the computer or sending their cameras back to the manufacturer to remove dust trapped inside. With Dust Reduction and the new creative features , Olympus continues to liberate users from the computer and editing software , and enables them to have fun capturing it all while on the go. Optional Accessories for Shooting on Land and in the Water The new HLD - 5 Power Battery Holder can hold up to two Lithium Ion BLS - 1 batteries to extend the performance life of the E - 620 and its existing BLS - 1 battery. It also enables effortless vertical shooting with its own separate shutter button and control dial. Olympus also offers the PT - E06 optional underwater housing for the E - 620. Capable of reaching depths of 130 feet underwater , the housing will ensure that divers will not miss an image during their journeys to the abyss.

Proudly made in Japan , every part of the X - Pro1 - from the sensor to the knurled finish of the mode dials - was painstakingly produced with an extreme attention to detail. Harkening back to a time when cameras had the kind of weight to them that gave a photographer confidence , Fujifilm has designed the X - Pro1 with a die - cast aluminum top and base , a leather like finish on the main body for grip and the look and feel of authentic leather , a natural fitting eyepiece , and other elegant touches like precise engraving on the top - plate. This level of attention to design and a photographer's comfort when shooting makes it almost hard to believe the X - Pro1 is a modern digital camera. That being said , the X - Pro1 is very much a digital camera , combining time - tested physical attributes - refined during the film era - and 21st century digital technology. Mirrorless , the camera's X Mount has a short flange back of just 17.7mm , meaning that rear lens elements are as close to the sensor as possible. This reduces the back focus distance of each lens and results in high resolution being achieved all the way to the edge of the image. The sensor is Fujiflm's 16.3Mp APS - C 23.6 x 15.6mm X - Trans CMOS sensor. The X - Trans utilizes a color filter array to attack moiré and false colors , resulting in an exceptionally true - to - life image that sensor's with optical low - pass filters cannot approach. The EXR Processor Pro supports the X - Trans sensor in its mission and works with an integrated co - processor for high speed and precision. The X - Pro1 also features the Hybrid Multi Viewfinder which allows you to switch between optical and electronic viewfinders. When an XF series lens is mounted to the camera the viewfinder magnification and frame size are automatically adjusted for immediate shooting. The optical viewfinder provides the brightest viewing image and keeps shutter lag to a minimum , while the electronic viewfinder provides focus confirmation , exposure information , white balance information , and depth of field indicators , as well as a "Live View" of your composition. In addition to the Hybrid Multi Viewfinder , the X - Pro1 has a 3.0" LCD screen with 100% coverage and 1 , 230 , 000 dots. Files can be stored to SD / SDHC / SDXC memory cards , and still images can be recorded in JPEG and RAW formats. Of course , the X - Pro1 can also capture H.264 HD video with stereo sound at 1920 x 1080 resolution. External TTL flashes can be attached to the camera using the hot shoe. Additional features include a self - timer , an ISO range of 200 - 6500 ( extended range of 100 - 25 , 600 ), and spot , average , multi - zone , and TTL 256 - zone metering options , among other useful functions.</DIV></DIV>

Capture landscapes with one touch using Sweep Panorama ; get that perfect portrait with Face Detection and Smile Shutter technologies , capture wider scenes with the 26mm wide angle lens , and automatically get clear shots with SteadyShot image stabilization and iAuto. Features : 12.1 Megapixel Super HAD CCD Image Sensor A powerful 12.1 megapixel 1 / 2.3" Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 12.1 megapixels , you can create stunning , photo - quality prints up to A3+ ( 13x19" ) size , or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. 2.7" Clear Photo LCD display ( 230k pixels ) Generous 2.7" ( 230K pixels ) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp , natural color that makes it easy to compose shots , read menus , and view photos , even in bright sunlight. Sony Lens with 4x Optical Zoom and 26mm equivalent wide angle The Sony 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for great outdoors , sports , and travel photos. Thanks to 26mm equivalent wide angle of this lens you can also get great group shots in tight spots. Sweep Panorama mode Reach beyond the traditional wide angle lens , and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed , then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra - wide options , the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 231 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep. SteadyShot image stabilization SteadyShot image stabilization compensates for camera shake and helps prevent blur through use of digital processing technologies. Intelligent Auto Mode Unlike traditional auto mode , Intelligent Auto ( iAuto ) mode thinks for you , recognizing scenes , lighting conditions , faces , and adjusts settings resulting clear images , faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground , landscape shots , a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party ; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode. Face Detection technology Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus , exposure , and white balance to help deliver crisp , properly lit images of family and friends. Smile Shutter technology Smile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene , even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. 480p AVI VGA Movie Mode3 In 480p AVI movie mode the camera shoots 640 x 480 movies at 30 fps , which is the format when working with a PC. Users will create movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac. Once transferred to your computer you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video - sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube. ( Compatible computer with internet capability required ) Soft Skin mode Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. Natural Flash Conventional point - and - shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color , for far more lifelike images. Self - Portrait Timer Self - Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face , it triggers a 2 - second timer , and then snaps a picture. Anti - blink Function It's frustrating to capture the perfect shot , only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti - blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap , the Anti - blink function captures two images , recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes , a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. Dynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus Dynamic Range Optimizer ( DRO ) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. Intelligent Scene Recognition ( iSCN ) Mode Intelligent Scene Recognition ( iSCN ) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and , within just 1 / 30th of a second , selects the appropriate camera settings : Backlight , Backlight Portrait , Twilight , Twilight Portrait , Portrait , Landscape and macro. iSCN has two modes : Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode , the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode , the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and , if in difficult lighting ( low light or back light ) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. High Sensitivity Mode ( ISO 3200 ) High ISO allows for faster shutter speed , so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode ( ISO ), you can select up to seven ISO settings ( Auto , 125 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 , 3200 ) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. Easy Shooting Mode With Easy Shooting Mode , even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode , easy - to - understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings , removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition , the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. In - Camera Retouching Tools Retouch and enhance your photos on the go with in - camera Trimming , Red - Eye Correction , and Unsharp Masking functions. PHOTOMUSIC4 PHOTOMUSIC4 combines images with music ( 4 tracks , 5 minutes per track ) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects ( Simple , Nostalgic , Active , and Stylish ) .

But as we grow older , we learn to color inside the lines , and have less and less time for art. We often lose touch with how satisfying it is to create something uniquely our own. Olympus delivers the E - 620 digital single lens reflex ( DSLR ) camera to bring back that free - style experimenting and the magical feeling of being inspired by our own art. The easy - to - use Art Filters and Multiple Exposures ( built right into the camera ) are fun for photographers -- whether youve been shooting for years or picked up your first digital camera today. Enjoy capturing creative images on the go -- without being tethered to a computer and editing software! Now it is possible to easily customize your images so theyre worthy of posting on the gallery wall ( or at least the family fridge ) . The E - 620's freedom of expression is matched by its freedom of mobility. First , the camera travels with you to more places , thanks to its compact size and light 18.9 - ounce body. Second , as the worlds smallest DSLR with in - body Image Stabilization , the E - 620 adjusts when your body moves to remove blur caused by camera shake ( with any lens attached ) . Finally , add Live View shooting with a swivel 2.7 - inch HyperCrystal LCD that frees you to cover subjects from a range of angles , and this 12.3 - megapixel DSLR seamlessly combines motions with emotions -- proof that Olympus lets you capture it all. Make Your Vision Come to Life with Art Filters If youre hoping to get more out of your camera than simply capturing and documenting a scene , and enjoy enhancing or customizing an image to make it your own , then you will value the cameras Art Filters. The filters , which are built into the camera , provide incredible individual artistic control over an image , and remove the need to spend time altering images on the computer with editing software. This camera was made for free - style shooting , experimenting and engaging with events and subjects. Enjoy the freedom of Autofocus Live View and dramatic effects to transform your day - to - day shots into compositions that you can be proud of with the following in - camera Art Filters : Pop Art : Enhances colors , making them more saturated and vivid , creating high - impact pictures that express the joyful , lighthearted feeling of the Pop Art style of the 1960s ; Soft Focus : Creates an ethereal , otherworldly atmosphere that renders subjects in a heavenly light without obscuring details ; Pale & Light Color : Encloses the foreground of an image in flat gentle light and pastel colors reminiscent of a flashback scene in a movie ; Light Tone : Renders shade and highlight areas softly to lend an elegant air to the subject ; Grainy Film : Evokes the feeling of documentary footage shot in monochrome with grainy , high - contrast film ; and Pin Hole : Reduces the peripheral brightness of an image as though it were shot through a pin hole , connecting the viewer intimately with the subject at the center of the picture. Art Filters are easily activated with the mode dial on the left side of the camera body. The effects are viewable right on the new cameras 100 percent accurate swivel 2.7 - inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD when using the E - 620 in Live View mode or when reviewing the captured image. Express Your Inner Artists Multiple Personalities With the new cameras Multiple Exposure function you are free to tell a visual story your way , whether in a portrait , a landscape or a combination of both. For instance , capture an image of the spring leaves on a new tree and then overlay an image of your childs face into the leaves for a stunning image that expresses the newness of the season. The image capture options allow you to shoot one shot , then another , or to capture both shots separately and combine them in the camera later. Or superimpose your own portrait with a starry night sky to create a photo with the impact you desire. Let your imagination lead you to new creative discoveries. Ready , Steady , Go with In - Body Image Stabilization The E - 620 travels with you to more places , thanks to its compact size and light 18.9 - ounce body. Capture sharp images on the go with the cameras in - body Image Stabilization , which virtually eliminates blur with any lens attached. Three IS modes handle any situation. The IS - 1 mode is for general shooting and adjusts the sensor on both the horizontal and vertical planes to compensate for movement by the photographer so images stay sharp in low light even at slow shutter speeds. To capture the motion of moving subjects , the E - 620 offers two specialized modes : IS - 2 mode is ideal for capturing a runner or cyclist traveling by in the horizontal mode , preserving the sense of motion while panning ; IS - 3 mode achieves the same effect when the camera is held vertically. In either mode , the artistic effects of panning enhance the shot and render the subject in sharp detail with blurred background. Moreover , the E - 620 is the worlds smallest DSLR with built - in Image Stabilization , so youll feel comfortable taking it on the road with you to capture the action. Superior Image Quality The new cameras high - performance 12.3 - megapixel Live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range , accurate color fidelity , and a state - of - the - art amplifier circuit to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas. Its Live MOS image sensor is complemented by Olympus TruePic III+ Image Processor , which produces clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible. The new image processor is noted for accurate natural color , true - to - life flesh tones , brilliant blue skies , and precise tonal expression ; it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings , enabling great results in low - light situations. Swivel Live View LCD : Freedom to Move You The new cameras 100 percent accurate 270 degree swivel 2.7 - inch Live View HyperCrystal III LCD can be rotated freely so photographers can compose at any angle , including overhead and down low , without getting bent out of shape. This enables an E - 620 photographer to compose a subject in the Live View LCD and see the results of the various creative features -- live as theyre happening. When viewing the LCD in Live View , settings like white balance and exposure can also be selected , and their impact is seen instantly on the display. Real - time monitoring offers amazing versatility and creative control. The LCD displays 230 , 000 pixels in vivid color and includes HyperCrystal technology , which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors for easier viewing in both preview and playback. It also provides a wide viewing angle of 176 degrees , which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. The 2.7 - inch LCD makes icons and text on the cameras menu easy to view. Beyond the cameras bright viewable LCD , the E - 620 is equipped with illuminated buttons on its body that are easily viewable in low light to quickly find the settings you want. Two Fast Autofocus Systems Consumers accustomed to composing and focusing using a point - and - shoot cameras LCD will appreciate that the E - 620 offers the same easy , seamless experience ( what you see on its LCD is what you get! ) . The E - 620 delivers two fast autofocus options to quickly focus and capture the image in any situation : Fast Imager Autofocus in Live View : When it comes to measuring camera speed , autofocus is a key factor. If a cameras AF system does not meet photographers demands and lock focus accurately and quickly , its possible to miss a shot. AF Live View on the E - 620 allows you to compose , focus , and capture the shot quickly and easily without ever taking your eye off the large 2.7 - inch full color LCD. Phase Detection AF : When using the optical viewfinder , the technology behind the new 7 - point twin cross AF system provides world - class fast and accurate focusing based on the speed of the E - 3. Super sensitive Twin and Twin Cross AF target points can measure focus both vertically and horizontally , so regardless of the subject , focusing is super - simple and fast. With a dedicated Phase Detection AF sensor in the camera body , shooting moving subjects , like a runner crossing the finish line , is lightning fast. In low - light situations , this is the AF option of choice to quickly lock focus , so that a loved ones face illuminated only by candlelight is in sharp focus. Multi - Aspect Shooting Since photography is a form of expression that is essentially based on clipping a scene , framing is an important component of style. The E - 620 provides four aspect ratios that serve as masks to frame your image to the desired proportions , including : the standard 4 : 3 aspect ratio that is perfectly suited for an 8 x 10 - inch enlargement ; the 16 : 9 aspect ratio that will display your images beautifully on a widescreen television ; and other popular aspect ratios such as 3 : 2 and 6 : 6. By enabling you to select the aspect ratio before shooting and easily viewing it on the LCD throughout the shoot , the Multi - Aspect function offers a new way to control your photography and express yourself. Always Find a Face in the Crowd The new cameras Face Detection reduces the chance of blurred subjects in photography by distinguishing between peoples faces and the background. It tracks up to eight faces within the image area , even if people are moving , and automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for sharp , brilliant portrait pictures ( ideal for large family or party group photos ) . In Sunshine or the Shadows , Never Miss a Detail Shooting scenes with both highlights and shadows can be tricky because of the extreme contrast between dark and bright areas. The E - 620 addresses this challenge with Shadow Adjustment Technology that adjusts for extreme light variations and maintains visible detail in both the shadow and highlight areas of the scene. Now users can see and preview the gradation on the Live View LCD and capture images showing the shadow detail they saw. This feature is also accessible in the Edit menu after the shot has been taken. Preview a Multitude of Possibilities Perfect Shot Preview enables users to easily preview and select from a variety of thumbnail previews of the photographic effects of white balance and exposure compensation adjustments live on the LCD before taking the photograph. It is an ideal way for novice users to learn about the effects of different photography techniques , visually , without having to scroll through menu options. With 28 preset scene - select modes for every imaginable shooting scenario , automatic modes and full manual controls , the E - 620 offers a world of possibilities to photographers. Wireless Flash Capability Wireless flashes help you cast the best light on your subjects and capture great images. For this reason , the E - 620 is compatible with the Olympus FL - 36R and FL - 50R wireless electronic flashes that are designed exclusively for digital photography. When these flashes are used in combination with the E - 620 , multiple - wireless flash photography is both easy and reliable. The E - 620 can control up to three wireless flash groups independently , with multiple flash units in each group for dramatic flash effects. Dust Reduction System for Spot - Free Images Life moves too fast to spend time worrying about dust ruining the perfect image. Olympus proven Dust Reduction System produces spot - free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter. The patented ultrasonic technology vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor and captures it on a special adhesive membrane every time the camera is turned on. These spot - free photos liberate users from hours spent retouching photographs at the computer or sending their cameras back to the manufacturer to remove dust trapped inside. With Dust Reduction and the new creative features , Olympus continues to liberate users from the computer and editing software , and enables them to have fun capturing it all while on the go. Optional Accessories for Shooting on Land and in the Water The new HLD - 5 Power Battery Holder can hold up to two Lithium Ion BLS - 1 batteries to extend the performance life of the E - 620 and its existing BLS - 1 battery. It also enables effortless vertical shooting with its own separate shutter button and control dial. Olympus also offers the PT - E06 optional underwater housing for the E - 620. Capable of reaching depths of 130 feet underwater , the housing will ensure that divers will not miss an image during their journeys to the abyss. Package Contents : E - 620 Body 14 - 42mm f / 3.5 - 5.6 Zuiko Lens USB Cable Video Cable Li - Ion Battery Pack ( BLS - 1 ) Li - Ion Battery Charger ( BCS - 1 ) Shoulder Strap OLYMPUS Master 2 Software CD - ROM Manuals and Registration card Product Description The world's smallest and lightest D - SLR with built - in Image Stabilization and a portable creative studio!

Advanced amateur photographers are a discerning group , and they've flocked to Canon's G - Series for its ability to meet and exceed their demands. The third - generation PowerShot G10 is a stunning successor , loaded with uncompromising specs like 14.7 megapixels , a 28mm wide - angle lens , and Canon's new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for notably improved face and motion detection. This is a camera that supports and nurtures creativity , with a full range of shooting and recording modes and compatibility with exciting accessories including Speedlite flashes. See the Beauty of Really High Resolution. 14.7 Megapixel digital camera for the highest image quality. The PowerShot G10 is equipped with a 14.7 - megapixel CCD. Combined with unsurpassed DIGIC 4 image processing , this impressive pixel count delivers richly detailed photos that resonate with lifelike depth from shadows to highlights. An important benefit to the G10's lofty pixel count is the flexibility it lends to the editing process. With 14.7 megapixels of resolution , any portion of any shot is a great candidate for enlargement. Enlarge and crop as your creative vision demands , confident that the detail you need is there for you. Get Mode in the Frame. High powered 5x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer plus a 28mm wide - angle lens gets you up close and personal to your subjects as well as captures more in your frame. The camera is equipped with a long 5x optical zoom , and Canon's own Optical Image Stabilizer Technology keeps images steady and blur - free all through the zoom range - even in low light - by detecting motion and generating a corrective signal. Because it is an optical system , more corrective movement is allowed and there is no degradation of image quality. The G10 is a highly versatile camera with a wide - angle zoom lens that reaches all the way from 28mm at the wide end to 140mm at the telephoto end ( 35mm format equivalent ) . You'll capture more image in every shot , and add greater depth to your overall photography. A World of Advantages With Canon's New Technology. New DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection , adds Servo AF , Face Detection Self - Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction for greater flexibility. DIGIC 4 Image Processor Canon's proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition , and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster , more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality , even at high ISO speeds. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A new Face Self - Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , and specify Face Self - Timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also , Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot G10 can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) The Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The G10 can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Creative Power in Your Control. Full range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG for the ultimate creative control. The PowerShot G10's RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. Shooting Modes Advanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. Auto The camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject. P Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically. Av Aperture - priority You define the aperture to either isolate your subject or have clarity throughout the entire picture , and the camera will choose the corresponding shutter speed. Tv Shutter - priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action , and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times , Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise. C Custom Define and store your two own settings to achieve the effects you prefer Stitch Assist Build awe - inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images Movie Shoot in high resolution VGA ( 640 x 480 at 30 fps ) or QVGA ( 320 x 240 at 30 fps ) for up to 1 hour or 4GB per clip Portrait The camera sets a large aperture , focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject "pop." Landscape For front to back sharpness , the camera sets a small aperture. Night Scene For impressive sunset or nightlife shots , the camera properly exposes the background and uses slow - sync flash for the subject Sports Ensure highly accurate autofocusing when shooting fast - moving subjects Foliage Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage , greenery and blossoms Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint Beach Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. Sunset Capture stunning sunsets with all the dazzle and impact. Fireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Aquarium Achieve proper flash - free exposure and natural hues at indoor aquariums. Underwater Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect. ISO 3200 Expands the user's ability to shoot in dark settings without using the flash Indoor Reduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors. Kids & Pets Reduced focusing time freezes fast - moving subjects , so you won't miss those special shots. Night Snapshot Get natural - looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash. Color Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. A View That's a Pure Pleasure. Large 3.0 - inch PureColor LCD II ( 460 , 000 dots / VGA ) with even greater true - to - life color reproduction. The PowerShot G10 gives you an extra - large 3.0 - inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. But size is only part of the story. Canon's PureColor LCD II offers more spectacular color , resolution and contrast even at an angle ( compared to PureColor LCD ) .

Superb still images powered by Canon's DIGIC 4 Image processor , evolved Face Detection Technology and a wide - angle 20x optical zoom are only the beginning. You can also create Full HD movies and see every detail on your HDTV thanks to HDMI output. The 10.0 - megapixel SX1 IS is the very first PowerShot equipped with a CMOS sensor , a hallmark of Canon's lauded EOS line. Full HD ( 1920 x 1080 pixels at 30 fps ) movie mode plus HDMI output for easy playback of video and photos on your HDTV. If you long for the convenience of an advanced still camera that also creates superb movies , the new PowerShot SX1 IS was developed with you in mind. Movies shot in Full HD ( 1920 x 1080 pixels ), capture your memories with all the clarity , realism and brilliance. The PowerShot SX1 IS also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies and photos on your HDTV with a mini - HDMI cable for direct connection to a high - definition monitor. This allows you to enjoy the full quality of HD with no degradation of image or audio in the signal , but also improves playback functionality , letting you view up to 130 still images at once. The first PowerShot camera to feature a 10.0 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor for superb image quality. Canon's proprietary CMOS sensors were formerly reserved for its storied EOS line. The PowerShot SX1 IS is the first PowerShot that gives you access to the astonishing imaging power of this technology. Unlike the CCD sensors on most digital cameras , CMOS sensors convert and amplify signals before they are transferred to the image processor. This enables the CMOS sensor to produce exceptionally clean image data , free of the stray signals that can mar images. The resulting images show a notable brilliance and clarity. 28mm wide - angle 20x Optical Zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer. The PowerShot SX1 IS features Canon's precision 28mm wide - angle lens that allows you to shoot any scene from wide - angle to telephoto. It lets you capture more in every frame , so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. When it's time to take a closer look , a 20x optical zoom ( 35mm film equivalent 28 - 560mm ) greatly minimizes camera shake and maximizes the brilliance of every detail. The camera uses a USM ( Ultrasonic Motor ) for high - speed , quiet , energy - efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. The SX1 IS is equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake - one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in , you can get the steady , crisp , brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. Large 2.8 - inch Vari - angle LCD widescreen for flexible viewing at nearly every angle , plus a viewfinder for more shooting options. The camera's 2.8 - inch LCD widescreen gives you the big picture , whether you're shooting , reviewing or showing off your images. This high - resolution screen offers a crisp , clear picture to make shooting , playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright , it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close - up with the Super Macro shooting mode. Full range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG for the ultimate creative control. The PowerShot SX1 IS's RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self - timer. Canon's most advanced image processor , DIGIC 4 , delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you're ready to shoot , then delivers perfect focus. In addition , exposure , flash and white balance are compensated , so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A Face Detection Self - timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include the photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , specify Face Detection Self - timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images for more natural transitions when the main subject is dark. The PowerShot SX1 IS can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The PowerShot SX1 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SX1 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select the ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. With 25 Shooting Modes including 12 Special Scene Modes , you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. When you're taking pictures , the only thing you want to think about is your subject. With the PowerShot SX1 IS , you can count on exact focus no matter where your subject is in the frame. You've got Shooting Modes including Special Scene Modes that give you breathtaking , exhilarating pictures even when shooting conditions are tough. Print / Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading , plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printers and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers. The PowerShot SX1 IS's Print / Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the PowerShot SX1 IS to a Canon PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer , press the lighted Print / Share button and print!

With Nikon's advanced Vibration Reduction technology , this new lens will enable photographers to make crisp , sharp pictures by minimizing the blur caused by hand holding a camera at slow shutter speeds and by potential shaking when the photographer is in a moving vehicle , aircraft or any other moving platform that induces vibration. In addition to Vibration Reduction , the AF - S VR Zoom - Nikkor 70 - 200mm f / 2.8G IF - ED lens includes a selection of Nikon advanced technologies such as Manual / Automatic mode , Extra Low Dispersion glass ( ED ), Silent Wave Motor Technology ( SWM ) and G - Type design ( aperture control exclusively from camera body ) . Offered exclusively in Nikon's AF - S optics , the Manual Automatic mode ( M / A ) allows for instant switching between autofocus and manual focus , virtually eliminating lag time in the transition and enabling photographers to make a last minute adjustment , even if the autofocus system has locked onto the subject. This performance is complimented by Nikon's Autofocus Tracking with Lock - on ( R ), a technology that will enable the system to maintain sharp focus even if the subject is momentarily obscured from view , or if the camera's AF sensor momentarily moves off the main subject. Extra Low Dispersion ( ED ) Optical Glass is a high quality , low dispersion glass that enables superior performance from this versatile , compact lens. Through low dispersion characteristics the lens' color performance is enhanced by virtually eliminated secondary chromatic aberrations that are common to telephoto optics that do not include ED glass ; this technology enhances image quality with added visible sharpness and contrast to the image. Nikon's exclusive Silent Wave Motor technology is another landmark development in Nikon's lens development program. Silent and fast autofocusing with superior accuracy and ultra - quiet operation ; this technology is highly regarded among professional photographers and is incorporated in a large assortment of Nikon lenses that bear the AF - S mark. The G - Type feature is designed for the newest Nikon SLR models , including both 35mm and digital , all of which feature a built in Sub - Command Dial , from which aperture control is possible. The design facilitates better lens handling , and helps photographers keep a more positive grip on the camera as they use their right index finger to adjust aperture. This firmer grip and excellent balance will help photographers get sharper images , even as they adjust exposure and quickly shoot their pictures. Distance Technology ( included in D - type and G - type Nikkor lenses ) provides precision distance information from the lens. This information is incorporated into exposure calculations for both ambient light and flash illumination , as well as combinations of both. The distance information enables more precise calculations , leading to improved exposure control. Additionally , D - technology also enhances the Nikon system for automatic balanced fill flash. This selection of Nikon high technology is an example of how Nikon approaches lens design , blending each lens' handling characteristics with those of the camera , for total handling excellence and optical design technology to maximize imaging performance. The AF - S VR Zoom - Nikkor 70 - 200mm f / 2.8G IF - ED is fully compatible with all Nikon SLR models that include a built - in aperture control Command Dial. It will also operate using Shutter Priority and Program Mode operation in many Nikon models that do not have a built - in aperture control.</DIV></DIV>

The A850 also incorporates SteadyShot INSIDE in - camera image stabilizer which actually shifts the image sensor to compensate for camera shake without sacrificing image quality. Additional features include Dual BIONZ imaging processors for continuous shooting at up to 3 fps , an ultra - bright glass pentaprism viewfinder , 3.0 - inch Xtra Fine LCD display and HDMI output. Ultra - Fine Images The camera's Exmor CMOS sensor delivers the photographic expressive power of wide angles and perspective that only a 35 mm full - frame sensor can offer , and is designed to take advantage of the resolving power of high - precision alpha lenses. Its high pixel count and large size provide enhanced image detail and a wider dynamic range for natural color reproduction and subtle tonal gradations. Image processing gets a boost in speed and power from two BIONZ processing engines. Large amounts of data captured by the 24.6 - megapixel sensor can be quickly processed to achieve a fast shooting response. Additionally , this dual BIONZ system applies advanced noise reduction algorithms producing images of exceptional quality and detail , especially at high ISO sensitivities. The camera's innovative intelligent preview function takes the guesswork out of setting up a shot and the hassle of taking multiple shots to achieve a desired effect. After pressing the depth of field preview button , the camera grabs a RAW preview image which is processed and displayed on the LCD screen. You can then fine tune white balance , determine the best level and effect of dynamic range optimization , adjust exposure compensation and check histogram data , all before you actually take the picture. Preview images are not recorded on the camera's memory card , thus saving capacity. The camera's autofocus system features nine sensors with 10 assist points for improved tracking of moving subjects. A center dual cross sensor comprised of two horizontal and two vertical line sensors as well as a dedicated f / 2.8 sensor are included to achieve greater precision , especially when using fast - aperture lenses.

It features a high - power condenser lens , an eyepiece with high reflective - index glass , and a multi - layer , anti - reflective coating on optical surfaces to deliver its extraordinarily bright view. A mirror box features a parallel - link mirror mechanism that moves on two horizontal axes to accommodate both the large full frame mirror and the body - integrated image stabilization system without increasing the camera's size. Anti - Shake System for a Full - Frame Sensor With its body - integrated SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization , the camera achieves an anti - shake effect equivalent to shutter speeds faster by 2.5 to 4 stops. The anti - shake system stabilizes all Sony , Minolta and Konica - Minolta compatible lenses even wide angle or large aperture lenses. Versatility to Unleash Creative Possibilities Other key features aimed to expand creative options include the Dynamic Range Optimizer ( DRO ) with five levels of user - selectable correction as well as DRO bracketing for enhanced scene analysis and graduation optimization. EV bracketing with ±2EV range makes it easy to create high dynamic range composite images. With the camera's HDMI output and Photo TV HD mode , your creative output can be enjoyed on a compatible HD television. This mode brings the look of actual printed photography to the television , by fine - tuning such image parameters as sharpness , gradation , and color reproduction. The a850 model features a 3 - inch ( diagonally ), Xtra Fine LCD screen ( 921K ) making it possible to check focus and image quality with accuracy.

The camera includes dedicated slots for high - capacity Memory Stick PRO Duo , Memory Stick PRO - HG Duo , HX series and CompactFlash media. Optional New All Bright Lens The choice of full - frame lenses to complement the a850 model is enhanced with the new SAL2875 28 - 75mm F2.8 SAM lens. This compact , easy - to - carry lens is ideal for photo enthusiasts looking to add a bright , general purpose zoom to their collection of full - frame optics. Delivering excellent imaging quality at an accessible price , it offers a wide F2.8 aperture over its entire zoom range.

From lenses and flashes to filters and grips , the A850 offers solutions to satisfy even the most demanding photographer. Extraordinary Durability The finest build quality to match the finest in imaging. The a A850 is constructed of a rugged and lightweight magnesium - alloy body for durability , while the moisture and dust - resistant design make this DSLR camera safe to use in a variety of environments. 35mm full frame 24.6MP Exmor CMOS image sensor The A850 features a 35mm full frame Exmor CMOS image sensor that is approximately 2.35x larger than the APS - C sized sensors found in many DSLR cameras. The result is a larger capture area , improved wide angle performance , and tighter depth of field control. In addition , its 24.6MP resolution maximizes the resolving power of your existing lenses and delivers sharper , higher contrast photos. SteadyShot INSIDE in - camera image stabilization Building on years of expertise , Sony has developed the world's first body - integrated image stabilization solution for a full frame DSLR1.

Both the sensor and processor work together to produce well - detailed , clear imagery that exhibits natural tonality and color gradations with minimal noise when working in difficult lighting conditions. The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system , including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full - resolution , quickened AF speeds , and full HD 1080p video recording in multiple frame rates with manual exposure and audio level control. Serving live view in both still and movie shooting modes , Dual Pixel CMOS AF is a powerful technology that revolves around the incorporation of two photodiodes within each pixel to provide an expansive phase - detection focusing system. This system affords focusing benefits that are similar to how a camcorder works and as such can focus on subjects in an incredibly fast and precise manner. The benefits of this system are three - fold : the ability to focus quickly and smoothly ; the ability to truly utilize the vari - angle touchscreen LCD monitor to its full potential ; and the ability to utilize a wide range of over 100 EF and EF - S lenses. Also benefiting from Dual Pixel CMOS AF is the Movie Servo AF mode , which enables continuous auto focusing when recording movies. This focusing mode is especially useful for maintaining critical focus on moving subjects and for realizing the near - silent performance of compatible STM lenses. The 3.0" 1 , 040k - dot vari - angle Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent of the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari - angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti - reflective , smudge - resistant coating allows for clear viewing in any lighting condition. In addition to the LCD monitor , the 70D also features an optical pentaprism finder that can be used for eye - level shooting of still images. This Intelligent Viewfinder incorporates a superimposed LCD to provide an intuitive means for monitoring exposure and camera settings during shooting. While working with the viewfinder , an expansive 19 - point all cross - type AF system is visualized for acquiring focus ; integral to this array is a high - precision dual - cross center AF point that is compatible with f / 2.8 and faster lenses. Providing a wealth of additional functionality to the camera is integrated Wi - Fi connectivity , which allows for the instant and direct sharing of image files to an iOS or Android mobile device for sharing online. This functionality also allows for wireless remote control over camera settings , including exposure controls , focusing , and shutter release , from a mobile device when using the Canon EOS Re</DIV></DIV>

DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self - timer. Canon's most advanced image processor , DIGIC 4 , delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you're ready to shoot , then delivers perfect focus. In addition , exposure , flash and white balance are compensated , so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A Face Detection Self - timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include the photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , specify Face Detection Self - timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. Blink Detection to alert a shooter after a shot has been taken , that a subject had closed eyes. Blinking subjects can ruin the best shots , and the problem usually isn't detected until it's too late to do anything about it. The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with Canon's new Blink Detection to combat this common image flaw. The feature uses the power of Face Detection to determine whether any subject in the previous shot had closed eyes. If closed eyes are detected , a "blink warning" icon appears for 3 seconds , allowing you to retake the shot before your subject or subjects move on.</DIV></DIV>

Create without limitation. Meet the new flagship of Nikons outstanding DX - format HD - SLR line - up : the Nikon D7100. Incorporating recent advancements in HD - SLR technology the D7100 brings a thrilling new level of image quality speed connectivity and creative capabilities -- a specially designed 24.1 - megapixel DX - format image sensor superior low - light performance ultra - precise autofocus and metering advanced video recording features built - in HDR mobile connectivity and much much more. Enjoy speed precision and convenience at every step from shooting up to 6 fps to instantly sharing your shots with the optional WU - 1a Wireless Mobile Adapter. Create dazzling Full HD 1080p videos and ultra - smooth slow - motion or time - lapse sequences. Pair it with any of Nikons superb NIKKOR DX - and FX - format lenses versatile Speedlights and accessories and the D7100 will be the centerpiece of your creativity for years to come. Key Features : Nikon DX - format CMOS sensor The D7100 employs a Nikon DX - format CMOS sensor with approx. 24.1 effective megapixels. It adopts an image sensor unit designed without an optical low - pass filter to take full advantage of the high resolving power only realized by utilizing a high pixel count. This allows the camera to bring out the true resolving power of 24.1 megapixels combined with NIKKOR lenses to deliver an amazingly sharp rendering of details. Even if trimmed or enlarged the images retain exquisite detail reproduction. EXPEED 3 image - processing engine EXPEED 3 processes multiple tasks in parallel while maintaining high precision to bring out the full potential of the 24.1 megapixels. It excels at color reproduction gradation processing and image quality at high sensitivity. It reproduces human skin tone hair and eye lashes more faithfully. Furthermore from image processing and card recording to image playback and image transfer EXPEED 3 manages massive amounts of data at high speed. Even with Active D - Lighting and high ISO noise reduction continuous shooting speed is not sacrificed realizing relaxed shooting. It also contributes to saving energy in the camera. Spot White Balance -- allows preset of white balance during live view shooting The D7100 comes equipped with a Spot White Balance function that allows you to easily acquire preset manual data based on a specific area of the frame you select during live view. This means that you can effectively achieve pinpoint white balance setting according to the selected subject or a part of it during live view. The selected Spot White Balance area can be moved around with the multi selector in the frame. This eliminates the need to use a gray card so that you can quickly acquire preset data without changing lenses even with a super - telephoto lens attached. This can come in handy when shooting sports indoors or in stadiums where various types of lights are mixed as it allows you to quickly preset the white balance to avoid missing decisive moments. Active D - Lighting for enhanced image quality Even when shooting high - contrast scenes in backlit situations Active D - Lighting preserves details in both highlight areas with varied brightness ( e.g. gradation of the sky ) and shadowy areas maintaining moderate contrast to reproduce brightness as you see it. The D7100 employs a new image - processing system that delivers superior reproduction without shifting color phase even when the strength level is increased. Image - processing time is reduced by high - speed and highly accurate real - time processing within pipelines. Furthermore color reproduction is largely improved thanks to the image - processing engine EXPEED 3. Active D - Lighting is suitable for moving subjects as it does not involve combining two images like HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) . HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) produces a single image with a wider dynamic range High Dynamic Range ( HDR ) function takes two images of different exposures with one shutter release and automatically combines them to produce a single image that has a wider dynamic range. This achieves images with less noise and rich tonal gradation including shadows and highlights even for high - contrast shooting scenes. The smoothness of the area where the two exposures meet is automatically set. HDR is ideal for stationary subjects such as high - contrast landscapes and still lifes. Picture Control System that creates an ideal image by fine - tuning color and tone The D7100 incorporates six types of Picture Control selectable according to your subjects and scenes. Selected Picture Control lets you fine - tune sharpening contrast etc. to match your own image creating ideas. These adjusted Picture Controls can then be stored in the camera and used in image - browsing / editing software ViewNX 2 ( supplied ) and image - editing software Capture NX 2 ( optional ) . Edge - to - edge sharpness achieved by lateral chromatic aberration reduction / automatic distortion control Unlike other correction methods that simply eliminate the colors of chromatic aberration Nikons lateral chromatic aberration reduction compensates for the differences in the resolving sizes of each color. This proves especially effective for reducing image distortion at the edges of a frame and for improving image quality throughout the entire frame regardless of the NIKKOR lenses used. If you set On for Auto distortion control when using G or D lenses barrel distortion caused by a wide - angle lens or pin - cushion distortion caused by a telephoto lens can be compensated. Special Effects bring more creative expression with simple operation The D7100 comes equipped with seven options of Special Effects delivering visual expression only available with digital photography. Whether stills or movies you can produce creative images using simple steps by applying the effects that best reflect your intention without editing software. As the result of an effect is displayed on the LCD monitor in real time you can set the effects while confirming the appearance of your picture. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced photographer this wide range of effects meets creative demands and greatly expands your range of expression. Special Effects incorporated in the D7100 : Night vision -- Expands your shooting range with super - high sensitivity Easily shoot at super - high sensitivity in extremely low - light conditions. It is possible to utilize this mode in night shooting for photojournalism or observing nocturnal wild animals. This mode records monochrome ( black and white ) images. Color sketch -- For sketch - style images The camera detects and colors subjects outlines to create sketch - style images. Vividness of colors and density of outlines are adjustable. Beneficial for shooting architecture with delicate features and photographing landscape or flowers with details. Miniature effect -- Turn a landscape photo into a portrayal of a diorama Easily shoot at super - high sensitivity in extremely low - light conditions. It is possible to utilize this mode in night shooting for photojournalism or observing nocturnal wild animals. This mode records monochrome ( black and white ) images. Selective color -- Creates a cinematic or commercial - like impression All colors other than the colors you want to emphasize are recorded in black and white. Up to three colors are selectable and the color range can be adjusted in values from 1 to 7. Silhouette -- Bestows a dramatic effect on subjects Easily shoot at super - high sensitivity in extremely low - light conditions. It is possible to utilize this mode in night shooting for photojournalism or observing nocturnal wild animals. This mode records monochrome ( black and white ) images. High key -- Creates images full of light Easily shoot at super - high sensitivity in extremely low - light conditions. It is possible to utilize this mode in night shooting for photojournalism or observing nocturnal wild animals. This mode records monochrome ( black and white ) images. Low key -- For dignified somber images suitable for hard subjects like metal and machinery Produces beautiful bright images filled with light by intentional overexposure. This is particularly effective when shooting subjects in white such as flowers or subjects in white clothes. 16 options of Scene Modes that let the camera automatically select the best settings for the scene Choose a mode according to the scene and the D7100 automatically selects the most appropriate settings to deliver a beautiful image. You can view the currently selected Scene Mode by rotating the mode dial to SCENE and pressing the Info button. To choose another Scene Mode rotate the main command dial. Scene Modes enable you to easily create beautifully effective pictures of scenes which previously have been difficult to achieve. High - density 51 - point AF system that includes compatibility up to f / 8 With the newly developed Advanced Multi - CAM 3500DX autofocus sensor module the densely located 51 focus points supported by an algorithm equivalent to that of the D4 deliver amazing capturing power. AF detection is available down to an impressive - 2 EV ( ISO 100 20 degrees C / 68 degrees F ) which is the brightness equivalent to a subject illuminated by moonlight. Fifteen cross - type sensors cover the most frequently used center area. The center point performs as a cross - type sensor even at f / 8. This enables AF shooting with the effective aperture value slower than f / 5.6 and at f / 8 or faster when an AF - S teleconverter is attached to the lens. For example accurate autofocus is possible with the effective aperture value of f / 8 by attaching a 2.0x teleconverter to a telephoto lens with maximum aperture of f / 4. By combining a teleconverter with compact and lightweight DX - format system you can enjoy supertelephoto AF shooting without bulky equipment and expand the photographic opportunities. Furthermore when the image area of 1.3x crop of DX is selected the angle of view becomes equivalent to that of a lens with about double the focal length in 35mm format. As the cropped frame is almost entirely covered by the focus points the camera demonstrates even more powerful capturing capability. Of the 51 focus points 11 can be chosen to shoot with for quicker focus - point selection. Not only phase - detection AF but also contrast - detect AF which employs image sensor data during live view shooting or movie recording has become significantly faster than that of the D300S. Whether in still - image shooting or recording movies the AF system supports accurate and comfortable focusing. 1.3x crop of DX that enables shooting distant subjects without bulky equipment for both stills and movies The D7100 features two image areas for still images -- DX format ( 23.5 x 15.6mm ) and 1.3x crop of DX ( 18.8 x 12.5mm ) . The format in use can be easily confirmed in the viewfinder. For videos the D7100 also employs DX - based movie format and movie image area based on 1.3x crop of DX. In DX format the angle of view becomes equivalent to that of a lens with approx. 1.5 times longer focal length. In the newly employed 1.3x crop of DX mode the angle of view becomes equivalent to that of a lens with approx. 1.3 times longer focal length than in DX format. As a result the image area becomes equivalent to that of a lens with about double the focal length. With this camera you can get closer to distant subjects even though it employs a relatively lightweight compact lens system. In the 1.3x crop of DX mode the 51 focus points cover nearly the entire frame attaining extremely high capturing power even when shooting moving subjects. The 1.3x crop of DX achieves an image size of approx. 15.4 megapixels a sufficiently high pixel count for general use which delivers high - resolution images. Combined with high - speed continuous shooting at up to approx. 7 fps enabled in this mode this camera reliably captures moving subjects.

A compact design with built - in flash and ergonomically organized controls , the G5 , in union with the Lumix G Vario 14 - 42mm lens , offers powerful photo and video performance resulting in top of the line image quality , sharp details and excellent resolution and color production. If you're interested in "going mirrorless" , this is the camera for you. A redesigned Venus Engine image processor and newly integrated 16.05 MP Live MOS sensor increase performance speed , improve Auto - focus and more so , render crisp and detailed images in both photo and video. The Venus Engine has improved its already advanced signal processing capabilities and with 3DNR and Multi - process NR can detect bright areas as well as smooth areas or edges within in an image and apply a multi - step noise reduction to further increase the sharpness of your photo. High Dynamic Range has been integrated on the G5 and will shoot several identical photos simultaneously in order to overlay them and create one perfectly balanced photo. In all Lumix G series cameras , the image sensor controls the auto focus. Called Contrast AF , it substantially improves focus accuracy , especially at brighter , smaller f - stops. The G5 has incorporated full - area Touch AF , making it possible to set focus on any point within the field of view and Light Speed AF in which focus is locked onto a moving subject. Combine these two elements with a burst rate of 6 frames per second ( in full resolution! ) and the G5 can shoot fast - moving objects , whether it be a flying bird or a fading smile , with DSLR - like accuracy.   The Live View Finder ( LVF ) on the Lumix G5 takes the standard view finder to another dimension. The adjustable eye sensor on the LVF senses the presence of an eye and switches the image output from the LCD screen to the eye piece. It also begins to Auto - focus as soon as it senses an eye , which can save you valuable microseconds when that is all you have to get the shot you want. The LVF is a large , bright 1 , 440 , 000 - dot equivalent with approximately 100% field of view while the LCD display is a full 920 , 000 - dot high resolution screen with wide - viewing angle and also offers 100% field of view. In addition , the LCD offers touch screen operation for basic shooting and playback and rotates 180º to the side and 270º up and down for easier image composition. Most impressive is that with Touch pad function , both the LCD and LVF can be on at the same time for more intuitive shooting. The lag time from shot to LCD output has been minimized on the G5 , so monitoring fast moving subjects is better than ever</DIV></DIV>

What does it take to render images perfectly. Sharp resolution. Subtle textures. Color fidelity. Tones so nuanced that the viewer wants to reach out and touch them. All of this is possible with the D800E Nikons newest FX - format DSLR. Its groundbreaking 36.3 megapixels and the powerful EXPEED 3 image - processing engine offer imaging potential that rivals some of the best studio cameras but with the agility and durability of a Nikon digital SLR body. Depict the slightest change in light or shadow on a piece of jewelry or in the glow of human skin. Still images reach a completely new height with unprecedented depth and details both indoors and out and this is only the beginning. Nikons exclusive 91K - pixel RGB sensor enables the Advanced Scene Recognition System to detect human faces even when shooting through the optical viewfinder adding even more of an edge to your AF AE and i - TTL flash performance. If your workflow demands broadcast quality video with high - fidelity audio recording D - Movie will satisfy even the most demanding clients. Moreover the D800E shoots 1080p Full HD in both FX - and DX - based formats offering cinematographers a liberating versatility. All of this works in conjunction with outstanding mechanical precision as well as the exceptionally sharp and versatile NIKKOR lens lineup. Turn your imagination into stunning still images and spectacular video. Create something monumental. With the D800E you can. Key Features : Nikon FX - format CMOS sensor with 36.3 effective megapixels The D800E renders levels of texture nuance and detail to your photography that until now have been the exclusive domain of the complicated medium - format system. Define every eyelash every line in tree bark and every shimmer of light. Savor the exceptional depth in your still images - with the combination of an astounding 36.3 effective megapixels and the outstanding performance of NIKKOR lenses you can. Enlarge them as big as A1 poster - sized prints ( 59.4 x 84.1 cm / 23.4 x 33.1 in. ) at 200 dpi or crop aggressively to reach the composition you desire all without sacrificing the detail and tonal range of the original. In order to maintain clean high - resolution images 14 - bit A / D conversion within the sensor and a high signal - to - noise ratio deliver phenomenal images in a diverse array of situations. The image sensors incredible potential does not stop with photography either. For cinematographers ready to put their exceptionally sharp NIKKOR lenses into action the D800Es 36.3 effective megapixel data is efficiently processed for exquisite 1080p broadcast quality video at 30p. Standard ISO 100 to ISO 6400 range expandable to ISO 50 to 25600 equivalent High - resolution studio - quality images shouldnt be restricted to the studio. The D800E has set a new benchmark for high - resolution DSLR cameras with crisp clean images across a wide ISO range. Flexibility like this opens up new imaging opportunities for both still photographers and cinematographers alike during the magic hour the time just before dawn or at dusk when available light is often beautiful but scarce. Even at high ISO settings the cameras intelligent noise reduction systems manage noise without sacrificing fine details giving the D800E the edge. The difference can even be seen in low - contrast subjects such as hair and grass textures which are often essential elements of cinema as well as high - resolution portraits and landscape images. High image quality at higher ISOs also means that you can shoot still images handheld more confidently knowing that fast shutter speeds will reduce blur. ISO 100 ISO 200 ISO 400 ISO 800 ISO 1600 ISO 3200 ISO 6400 A strategic approach to turn light to your advantage Combining both high - resolution performance and a wide ISO sensitivity range has finally become a reality. Nikon engineers have developed intelligent new methods to manipulate light transmission to the sensors photodiodes : from the optical low - pass filter and on - chip gapless micro lenses to the image sensors internal design every measure has been taken to maximize and improve light transmission in order to deliver crisp brilliant images with significantly less noise. All this is possible under a wide variety of lighting conditions enabling you to get the most out of your NIKKOR lenses. Optical low - pass filter optimized for sharpness on the D800E Reducing false color and moiré is the main job of the optical low - pass filter located in front of the image sensor. However this benefit is generally gained with a small sacrifice of sharpness. Moiré occurs in scenes containing repetitive details such as strong vertical lines in architecture. Finding the right balance between benefits and sacrifices is the key to higher image quality and that is what the D800Es optical low - pass filter delivers. As a result the astounding 36.3 megapixels unleash their potential through an optimized balance between sharpness and effectively prevented moiré and false color. Furthermore the multi - layer structure of the D800E low - pass filter utilizes layers of antireflective coating that have been optimized for the camera contributing to sharper and clearer images. The ultimate attention to detail - the D800E Nikon engineers have developed a unique alternative for those seeking the ultimate in definition. The D800E incorporates an optical filter with all the anti - aliasing properties removed in order to facilitate the sharpest images possible. This is an ideal tool for photographers who can control light distance and their subjects to the degree where they can mitigate the occurrence of moiré. Aside from the optical filter all functions and features are the same as on the D800. Note : The D800E carries an increased possibility that moiré and false color will appear compared to the D800. IR cut and antireflective coating properties of the optical filter remain the same with both versions. Comparison of resolution : D800 / D800E have the same resolution of 36.3 megapixels The D800E reproduces the texture of the stone pavement and twigs with higher resolution than the D800. It allows sharper rendering with depth. Comparison of false color and moiré With the D800E moiré and false color may be noticeable when there are repetitive and fine patterns on a subject such as kimono fabric. To avoid this it is necessary to take measures for example changing the focusing point or shooting distance. Nikon Integrated Dust Reduction System that includes an Image Sensor Cleaning function Any dust that reaches the image sensor results in unattractive spots on your images. To prevent this the D800E employees Nikons Integrated Dust Reduction System which includes a self - cleaning sensor unit with four different resonance frequencies to vibrate the optical low - pass filter and shake dust away from the sensor. This function can be set to operate automatically when the camera is turned on or off or to manual. EXPEED 3 image - processing engine : speed versatility and high performance High - megapixel still images are detail - rich but data - heavy. With the D800E however you dont have to sacrifice speed for this privilege. Dedicated to understanding speed and its role in image making Nikon engineers designed a powerful EXPEED 3 image - processing engine exclusively for digital SLRs. From image processing and card recording to image playback and image transfer EXPEED 3 manages massive amounts of data at faster speeds than EXPEED 2. Even with specialized processing features like Active D - Lighting and high ISO noise reduction capture speed is not affected. EXPEED 3 is so powerful that it handles data - intensive tasks such as Full HD video recording at 30p with ease. Youll also notice the difference in your still images and videos through minimized noise and even richer colors and tones. In addition to these fundamental advantages the D800E reduces the kind of color phase shift that some cameras have difficulty with in similar situations. 14 - bit A / D conversion and 16 - bit image processing for rich tones and natural colors Tonal gradation is where an image transforms from simply representing life to taking on a life of its own. The D800E does exactly that with cutting - edge image processing that injects vital energy into your images. Black is rendered as pitch black and shadow details are subtle and rich. Even under harsh high - contrast light where some cameras can fail the D800Es gradation remains smooth with abundant detail and tone all the way up the scale to pure white. Lateral chromatic aberration reduction : Take full advantage of your NIKKOR lens collection High - megapixel sensors can really test the quality of your lenses but you can be confident that the combination of brilliant NIKKOR lenses and Nikons intelligent processing measures will significantly reduce lateral chromatic aberration to give you incredibly natural - looking results. Unlike other correction methods that simply eliminate chromatic aberration Nikons method compensates for these color differences in a resolving index for each color making it particularly effective in producing images with stunning edge - to - edge sharpness. Moreover because these corrections are made regardless of the NIKKOR lens used this feature contributes substantially to achieving the sharpest images possible. Advanced Scene Recognition System with 91K - pixel RGB sensor Nikons revolutionary Advanced Scene Recognition System introduced with the flagship D4 camera is also employed in the D800E. At its core is a 91K - pixel RGB sensor that meticulously analyzes each scene with the fine resolution. The RGB sensor can recognize your scenes colors and brightness with unprecedented precision then use that information to implement various automatic controls and give you more natural - looking results. The real breakthrough however is that the sensor can detect human faces with startling accuracy when shooting through the optical viewfinder. Along with face detection detailed scene analysis is utilized to support more accurate autofocus auto exposure and i - TTL flash exposure results in a diverse range of compositional and lighting situations. The improved subject tracking is most noticeable when using 3D - tracking which can maintain a focus on moving subjects smaller in size than with previous generations. More accurate face detection in auto - area AF and subject tracking in 3D - tracking Auto - area AF and 3D - tracking are AF - area modes unique to Nikon that use your subjects color and brightness information to detect focus. With the D800E theres more precise information and subject recognition advancements expect big steps forward for both AF - area modes when taking high - quality still images. In auto - area AF the camera can genuinely detect human faces and focuses on them immediately - useful when faces are a priority and theres no time to choose focus points. When using 3D - tracking the sensors fine resolution combines with a specifically optimized AF algorithm to realize unprecedented subject tracking precision recognizing detailed patterns to keep your subject in sharp focus. 3D color matrix metering III for more accurate exposures Professional photographers who shoot still images know that Nikons metering system delivers supremely well - balanced exposures. Thanks to the 91K - pixel RGB sensor the D800E has far more detailed scene information at its disposal - including detected face information. This data helps the 3D color matrix metering III deliver more desirable auto exposures especially when there are human faces present. When the D800E detects a human face in a backlit situation the camera determines the overall exposure while prioritizing the facial exposure which might otherwise be underexposed. When a face is lit from the front and appears much brighter than the background the camera recognizes the situation and avoids blowing out the facial details. More balanced results in i - TTL balanced fill - flash and Active D - Lighting Nikons i - TTL system has long been considered the most accurate flash control system in photography but now face detection and highlight analysis by the 91K - pixel RGB sensor pushes performance even further. With the D800Es enhanced i - TTL balanced fill - flash you can more precisely illuminate peoples faces in relation to their surrounding brightness using either the built - in flash or an external hot - shoed Nikon Speedlight. For weddings and fashion shoots or any photography that relies on the highest - quality still images this new standard redefines what a flash system should be. Face detection also makes a difference when Active D - Lighting is used to retain highlights and shadows in high - contrast lighting situations. Faces will be optimally exposed both in the sun and in the shade. Light source identification for auto white balance in still images The auto white balance is incredibly accurate in a diverse range of shooting situations aided by unique Nikon technology that effectively identifies your light sources both natural and artificial. With the 91K - pixel RGB sensor and the image sensor working together the camera renders white as white with supreme accuracy. Or if you prefer the auto white balance can be set to reflect the warmth of ambient incandescent lighting. Contribution to D - Movie shooting Advanced Scene Recognition System enhances not only still image shooting but also various controls used in movie shooting. It identifies light sources and human faces finely utilizing the high resolution of the image sensor to deliver accurate auto white balance and exposure control during movie shooting and improves the precision of subject - tracking AF. Furthermore it automatically detects flicker effects and controls the exposure to reduce them. Direct access to Picture Control that enables quick setting Customize the look of your stills and videos through Picture Controls by fine - tuning parameters such as sharpening saturation and hue. The D800E now allows you to access Picture Control instantly and directly from a dedicated button rather than entering the menu. When live view shooting you can visually confirm how customized Picture Control settings will look and easily adjust the parameters. Full HD video quality and minimized rolling shutter effect : Dynamic movie shooting in diverse lighting situations Many filmmakers multimedia professionals and still photographers need the highly mobile lightweight and compact form of a DSLR in order to cover large events or make documentaries music videos or movies. For these professionals the D800E is ready to create true cinematic experiences. By using the B frame data compression method you can record 1080p Full HD video at 30p in H.264 / MPEG - 4 AVC format with unmatched moving image integrity for up to approximately 30 minutes of recording in a single clip. Thanks to Nikons latest image - processing optimizations the monumental power of 36.3 megapixels transforms to sharp exquisitely rendered videos. Expect exceptionally smooth gradation in blue skies with minimum block noise and beautifully natural movement rendered clearly and sharply. The D800Es intelligent image sensor reads out movie images at faster rates than ever significantly reducing the rolling shutter distortion that can occur during panning shots or when shooting fast - moving lateral subjects like trains. Thanks to EXPEED 3 your movies will take on a distinctive look of their own even with dimly lit scenes. Combine these benefits and youll begin to realize exactly the new creative opportunities possible for photographers and cinematographers alike. Multi - area mode Full HD D - Movie : Creative movie - making freedom in FX - and DX - based formats The D800E is designed to stimulate cinematographers to explore different moods and perspectives by enabling Full HD and HD video recording in two frame formats ; Nikon FX - and DX - based movie formats in just one camera. When using wide - aperture NIKKOR lenses the large image area of the FX - based format* renders exquisitely shallow depth of field with beautiful bokeh effects. The DX - based format uses an image area similar to 35mm movie film allowing cinematographers to shoot with picture angles that they are accustomed to. Having the advantage of two D - Movie formats in one camera and an arsenal of NIKKOR lenses makes the D800E is an incredibly versatile movie - making tool. *The aspect ratio of movies is 16 : 9 whichever format is selected. Also in the FX - based movie format the width of the image area is approx. 91% of that in the still image FX format. Smoother video recording under fluorescent or mercury lamps : Auto flicker reduction With the D800E it is easier than ever to reduce flicker effects during live view and video recording. Simply use auto in the flicker reduction menu to automatically identify the flicker frequency at the beginning of live view and switch to the one that will work best. You can also manually switch between 50 Hz and 60 Hz. Comprehensive high - fidelity audio recording control The D800E is designed for crisp stereo recording with a built - in external stereo microphone input. Attach the compact ME - 1 Stereo Microphone to record clear sound while significantly reducing mechanical noise. An external headphone jack enables you to effectively monitor and control audio in isolation. While the audio level indicators offer visual confirmation of audio level the microphone sensitivity can be controlled precisely in 20 incremental steps. View simultaneous live view output on external monitors and record uncompressed video via HDMI During movie shooting you can now simultaneously check videos on an external monitor using an HDMI connection in addition to the cameras TFT monitor. And for those who need the purest video output for professional quality editing you can now record uncompressed movie live view footage directly to an external storage device via HDMI interface. Time - lapse photography Capture a variety of scenes and subjects at a breathtaking pace. The D800Es time - lapse photography lets you set intervals and frame rates in order to dramatically relay slow - moving activity at dramatic speeds. The D800E allows you to shoot time - lapse photography with replaying rates from 24 times to 36 000 times faster than normal. Time - lapse photography files can be saved as a movie file. Versatile custom settings for D - Movie The D800E has addressed useful feedback from videographers with convenient custom controls for D - Movie operation. Instead of rotating the command dial power aperture enables smoother aperture controls during movie live view using a button designated via custom menu which can be very convenient to confirm depth of field. Index marking helps you locate important frames for later - stage in - camera editing and replay by attaching markers during movie recording. Markings are indicated along with the progress bar which is easy to confirm visually. Advanced Multi - CAM 3500FX autofocus sensor module for razor - sharp detection in low light Accurate AF detection is crucial for extremely high - resolution still images in every situation. The 51 sensor points in the D800Es AF sensor module work down to - 2 EV ( ISO 100 20 degrees C / 68 degrees F ) the approximate physical limit of human visibility through an optical viewfinder. For even more powerful detection you can rely on the cameras 15 crosstype sensors in the center to detect both vertical and horizontal lines when using any AF NIKKOR lenses of f / 5.6 or faster. Whats more AF can be activated with eleven focus points in the center with open aperture of f / 8* which is a big plus when you combine a telephoto lens with a 2.0x teleconverter to shoot distant subjects. Versatile AF - area modes Whether its a still life a portrait a landscape or a candid street scene your subject matter varies but its importance doesnt. Thats why the D800E offers four AF - area modes each specifically tailored to adapt to various subjects. Single - point AF is ideal when you need pinpoint focus on stationary subjects. Dynamic - area AF has three options ( 9 - point 21 - point and 51 - point ) and is ideal for shooting moving subjects. The selected AF point and the surrounding points keep your subject in sharp focus even if it briefly leaves the selected points. 3D - tracking allows you to maintain focus on subjects that are moving erratically from side to side. Auto - area AF detects human faces and prioritizes their sharpness for you - an ideal choice for candid photography. Choosing AF mode and AF - area mode combinations Control your desired AF mode ( continuous or single servo ) and AF - area mode ( single - point dynamic - area 3D - tracking or auto - area AF ) without ever taking your eye away from the viewfinder. By using a dedicated AF - mode button and command dials you can switch between modes without interrupting your creative flow. Glass prism optical viewfinder with approximately 100% frame coverage See every important element in your frame clearly and precisely. The D800E offers approximately 100% frame coverage ( in FX format ) from its slim pentaprism giving you the visually comfortable FX - format advantage and an unobstructed view when shooting still images. The viewfinder image is not only large and bright - the focusing screen is also carefully designed to help you sense sharp focus intuitively be it manual or autofocus. High - precision high - durability shutter The D800Es shutter unit has been tested to well over 200 000 cycles of release to prove durability and precision. While the shutter unit designed to run at a speed range of 1 / 8 000 to 30 s its intelligent self - diagnostic shutter monitor automatically monitors actual shutter speeds in order to correct possible variances that can occur over time. High - precision sequential control mechanism For true digital SLR excellence the cameras mechanical structure power and precision are vital to ensure indispensable speed and reliability. Thats why Nikon utilized its engineering expertise to refine the powerful sequential control mechanism that drives the shutter mirror and aperture independently. As a result shutter release can be operated with mirror - up position during live view. Because mirror - down movement is not required you can expect even quieter still live view shooting. And as power aperture control operates via the stepping motor the sound of mechanical adjustment is reduced for quieter and smoother control. Active D - Lighting that reproduces brightness as you see it Active D - Lighting preserves details in both highlights and shadowy areas of high - contrast scenes. Color reproduction is improved thanks to the image - processing engine EXPEED 3 and exposure control considering face brightness is achieved by the enhanced face detection performance of Advanced Scene Recognition System. Expand dynamic range : HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) The D800E can shoot two frames in a single shutter release but at different exposures : one overexposed and one underexposed. The camera then instantly combines them to create an image covering a wider dynamic range. The range can be widened by up to 3 EV for different looks all full of saturation and tonal gradation while the smoothness of the edge where the two exposures meet can be adjusted for a more natural appearance. Fast response time The D800E is designed to respond immediately. Once the strategically located switch is turned on the camera starts up in approx. 0.12 seconds* and your finger is in position for shutter release. Release time lag is minimized to approx. 0.042 seconds* equivalent to that of the D3S with continuous approx. 4 fps capability in FX format approx. 5 fps in 1.2x and DX format and approx. 6 fps capability in DX format** with MB - D12. *Based on CIPA Guidelines. **When used together with batteries other than EN - EL15. Shoot achieving reduced blur with zoom lenses in dim light : Auto shutter speed control for auto ISO sensitivity control The D800E comes equipped with an auto option for minimum shutter speed that automatically controls the balance between shutter speed and the ISO sensitivity based on the focal length of the lens being used. This can be particularly useful when using a zoom lens because the camera can automatically choose the shutter speed to reduce camera shake. Whats more through the operation of ISO button and sub - command dial auto ISO sensitivity control can be immediately turned on or off without needing to enter the menu. Shoot with multiple formats in one camera : Image area options The D800E offers four image area options : FX format ( 35.9 x 24.0 mm ) 5 : 4 ( 30.0 x 24.0 mm ) 1.2x ( 30.0 x 19.9 mm ) and DX format ( 23.4 x 15.6 mm ) with all cropped image areas visually masked in the viewfinder. DX format offers approx. 1.5x and 1.2x crop offers approx.1.2x telephoto effect. When a DX NIKKOR lens is used DX format is automatically selected. Capture NX 2 ( optional ): Optimal for processing images taken with the D800E To accommodate the imaging power of the D800Es 36.3 effective megapixels the latest Capture NX 2 now features powerful 64 - bit processing. Capture NX 2 drastically simplifies an array of image enhancement procedures letting you concentrate on making your pictures the best they can be. Instead of complicated layering and memorization simply place a Color Control Point wherever you want to reprocess. Color Control Points use intuitive slider controls to make quick and easy adjustments to image characteristics such as brightness contrast saturation and tones. Change adjust and experiment all you like safe in the knowledge that all changes are non - destructive and an original always remains intact. 3.2 - inch super - density 921 000 - dot VGA LCD monitor with automatic brightness control The D800Es large and sharp color LCD monitor delivers bright crisp image playback with a much larger capacity for accurate color reproduction. Using an antireflective structure you can count on clarity equal to that of the D4 even under bright conditions. Moreover if monitor brightness is set to Auto the camera automatically adjusts LCD brightness according to the environmental lighting conditions measured by the ambient brightness sensor allowing easy use of live view in both bright and low - lit places - very useful when shooting video and stills. The ability to magnify playback images up to 46x ( Large - size images in FX format ) is extremely helpful for spot focus confirmation. Contrast - detect AF that enables sharp focusing During live view and movie recording contrast - detect AF is available for sharp focusing. Selectable AF servo modes include single - servo AF ( AF - S ) suitable for still image shooting and full - time servo AF ( AF - F ) for movie shooting. Also from four AF - area modes you can select the most appropriate mode according to your subject. Contrast - detect AF allows you to focus anywhere within a frame to expand your creative freedom. AF - area modes Face - priority AF Suitable for focusing on a persons face such as for a commemorative photo. Up to 35 faces can be detected. When multiple faces are detected the camera will focus on that recognized to be the closest. Alternatively you can choose a different face in the frame with the multi selector. Wide - area AF For hand - held shooting of landscape shots. AF area can be moved to the desired position within a frame. Normal - area AF Ideal for tripod shooting to achieve a pin - point focus in close - up shots. AF area can be moved to the desired position within a frame. Subject - tracking AF Suitable for a moving subject. After focus is locked with the center button of the multi selector AF area tracks the subjects movement.

Simply clicking the live view selector switches between live view modes designed specifically for still images or movies. Live view photography lets you shoot still images while confirming the exposure level on the LCD monitor*. You can even magnify images up to approx. 23x to check the exact focus. For movie live view on the other hand the D800E incorporates a dedicated exposure control for quality video shooting enabling smooth exposure transition when shooting moving subjects. You can also shoot video with full manual control. When needed press the shutter - release button while filming to instantly capture still images in 16 : 9 aspect ratio. Each time you use live view for either still photography or movie shooting your image area and camera setting information will be clearly indicated allowing you to confirm quickly. *Exposure preview display and resulting image may vary depending on the settings used. Accurate confirmation of level shooting : Dual - axis electronic virtual horizon With the D800E you can always check the LCD monitor or the viewfinder for both the cameras position in relation to the horizontal plane and its pitch ( forward or rear rotation ) . This can enhance compositional accuracy particularly when shooting still lifes landscapes and architecture. Improvements around the shutter - release button Angle shape contour and texture : all of these design facets came into play when crafting the shutter - release button. Your index finger can rest comfortably for longer periods of time allowing you to concentrate when it matters while the designated movie - record button means youre ready to trigger movie shooting in an instant.

You can also use two cards simultaneously for a number of functions such as recording JPEG and RAW data on separate cards recording the same data simultaneously on two cards for backup and more. Refined color temperature control : Minute control over white balance The D800Es white balance proves its reliability even when using an external flash and live view in the studio environment. The monitor hue of live view and resulting images white balance can be individually set so that the difference between the two is minimized.

Miniature Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly reduced to doll - house - like proportions and Toy Camera Effect recreates the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens an effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics the Fisheye lenses that are favorites of professional photographers for their quirky convex perspective.

Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized ; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes such as in a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes ; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high - speed X - sync ( X - sync means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released ) up to 1 / 200 sec. the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes or dim. 3.7 fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAW.

Never before has Canon equipped an ELPH with a back - illuminated CMOS sensor - driven HS SYSTEM or an f / 2.0 lens - both of which deliver incredible images in low light. And shooting action or sporting events has never been so fun , with High - Speed Burst mode and the Super Slow Motion Movie function to mix things up. You'll control shots like a pro with Aperture - and Shutter - priority modes , and play your 720p HD movies effortlessly on your HDTV. All this from a super - slim style icon - what more could you ask? A new 10.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor combined with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor create the Canon HS SYSTEM for improved low light performance and better image quality. A bright f / 2.0 lens , great for shooting in low light conditions or using a shallow depth - of - field for great images with beautiful soft backgrounds. 720p HD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output connector for easy playback of video and photos on your HDTV. Shoot slow motion video with the Super Slow Motion Movie function or capture fast action shots with the High - Speed Burst mode. Bring creativity to your photos with new scene modes such as Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect. Plus Low Light mode for dimly - lit situations. Shoot like a pro with Aperture - and Shutter - priority modes for extra control of your images. Experience the Power The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear , blur - free shots with all the ambiance intact , and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds , and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in a compact PowerShot. The first is the 10.0 Megapixel CMOS Sensor , which positions the light - receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer , blur - free images with plenty of detail and nuance , even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS SYSTEM is Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor , which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing. A Big Lens for Big Ambitions The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH sports an f / 2.0 aperture , perfect for creating enticing portraits , by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth - of - field. The Macro setting lets you get even closer. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. You'll be ready for anything with a lens aperture larger than even many professional sizes. Shoot Video in HD and Enjoy Easy HD Playback The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful 720p high definition ( 1280 x 720 pixels ) . The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies ( and still photos ) on your HDTV with a mini - HDMI connector for direct connection to a high definition TV monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal , plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. Take Control of the Action Give your movies a whole new look with the Super Slow Motion Movie function. Whether you're going for a dreamy , creative slant when documenting family moments , or making a highlight film of your kids' greatest sports plays , you'll love the high quality capture of this all - new feature. The camera shoots your clips at high speed ( approx. 240fps ) and plays them back at 30fps for the inimitable super slow motion feeling you'll love. High - Speed Burst is exactly what you need when you're trying to capture the best possible shot within a moment of fast - moving action. In High - Speed Burst mode , the camera automatically shoots continuously at high speed ( approx. 8.4fps ) * while you simply hold down the shutter. The mode lets you shoot sporting events , kids in motion , wildlife and any situation with unpredictable movement , then simply choose the best shots captured. Creative Effects Take Your Photos Further The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH offers creative effects similar to those found in certain professional lenses. Miniature Effect creates an illusion where very large objects appear in miniature proportions. Turn soaring cityscapes into a scene in seemingly dollhouse - like proportions. Fisheye Effect uses barrel distortion to warp the image around the center , giving a distinctive curvature effect to the photo. The curvilinear images produced by Fisheye Effect can suggest the curve of the Earth , the inside of a dome , or the image you see through the peephole of a door.

Fireworks - Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Stitch Assist - Build awe - inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images. Shoot it Your Way For photography enthusiasts , the ability to control aperture and shutter speed is key. The Aperture - and Shutter - priority modes on the Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH make it easy for anyone to take extra control over the look and feel of images captured. In Aperture - priority mode , you set the aperture and the camera automatically selects an appropriate shutter speed. This lets you create sharp subjects with beautifully blurred backgrounds , and landscapes with foreground , middle ground and background all in focus. Shutter - priority mode lets you choose a shutter speed while the camera automatically selects the aperture. Higher shutter speeds are great for catching stop - action shots of moving subjects , while lower shutter speeds can create atmospheric blur. NOTES *Depending on the shooting conditions , camera settings and the zoom position , the shooting speed may slow down. As the number of images increases , the shooting interval may take longer.</DIV></DIV>

And despite being less than 1" thick , it is packed with state - of - the - art technology and advanced features. The camera has a resolution of up to 8 megapixels for detailed images and poster size prints , and it includes a 5x optical zoom lens , Fujifilm's acclaimed Face Detection system , intelligent red - eye removal and Dual Image Stabilization with CCD - shift image stabilization. The slender design of the FinePix Z100fd includes a unique 'diagonal slide' lens cover , and is almost totally flat , so that the camera can be carried in a shirt or jacket pocket , yet it boasts an impressive 5x optical zoom lens covering a wide zoom range equivalent to 35 - 177mm on a 35mm camera. To avoid the problems of camera shake at longer focal length the camera features CCD - shift image stabilization. To further reduce the chance of blur spoiling shots in low light the FinePix Z100fd also features sensitivity settings up to ISO 1600 , allowing natural images that retain the atmosphere of evening events to be taken without the use of flash. If a Flash is needed , Fujifilm's Intelligent Flash system sets the power output to achieve natural foreground illumination with balanced background exposure. Intelligent Flash results in visibly more pleasing , natural looking photos , avoiding the harsh lighting effect that can occur with traditional in - camera flash. There is also a Natural Light plus Flash mode that takes two photos in quick succession , one with flash and one without. Both photos are then displayed side by side for quick comparison so users won't miss the moment while fiddling with flash settings. The FinePix Z100fd is very easy to use , and it makes perfect portraits simple with Fujifilm's Face Detection technology. Face Detection works by using an algorithm to optimize focus , white balance and exposure for up to ten faces in a single frame , while movement tracking keeps the camera 'locked on' to its subjects until they move out of the picture. Automatic red eye removal works in tandem with the Face Detection system to find and instantly correct any red eye from every face in the frame , and releives you from having to manually remove red eye on your PC. The camera also has 16 scene modes that include selections such as beach , party and fireworks for optimum photography , no matter what the event. The FinePix Z100fd features a large high - resolution 2.7 inch ( 230 , 000 pixel ) LCD screen with a reinforced glass coating for scratch - free durability. A redesigned graphical user interface and control layout ensures that the powerful feature set remains easy to use even for the novice digital camera user , and a micro thumbnail view ( showing 100 shots on one screen ) and control wheel makes sharing the largest collection of images a pleasure. The camera also has dual card slots for Dual xD - Picture Card and SD / SDHC compatibility to provide the user with the freedom to choose from a wide range of high capacity memory cards.</DIV></DIV>

The Canon PowerShot S100 is a sophisticated pocket - friendly point - and - shoot digital camera that has the power advanced users and enthusiasts need to create standout images. As with other PowerShot cameras the compact PowerShot S100 incorporates all of the advanced Canon technologies that make capturing superb photos and video as easy as pressing a button. Yet when its time to get creative the very same camera in the hands of a skilled photographer can produce stunning images that would be at home in a gallery. As automatic or manual as you need it to be the PowerShot S100 is at once a pocket camera and a serious photographic tool impressing even demanding pros. It incorporates the Canon HS SYSTEM now featuring the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor for enhanced image quality and amazing low - light performance. The fast f / 2.0 lens helps you tackle unfavorable lighting and capture breathtaking portraits with beautiful shallow depth - of - field. 12.1 Megapixels ensure crisp richly detailed images and a 5x Optical Zoom provides an excellent all - around range to shoot near or far. Key Features : Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor : The Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i - Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural - looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source the new Canon Multi - Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed for example for the main subject and the background. Canon CMOS Sensor : The PowerShot S100 digital camera employs a new Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. Inheriting much of the advanced technology developed for Canon EOS DSLR cameras this sensor delivers state - of - the - art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras such as the PowerShot S100. Utilizing a sophisticated light - capturing design it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture without increased noise. It is also a high - speed design capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus. Advanced Noise Reduction Conventional Image Processor with DIGIC 5 Image Processor Advanced White Balance Conventional Image Processor with DIGIC 5 Image Processor Canon HS SYSTEM : The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low - light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras : a high - sensitivity imaging sensor which is able to capture more light ; and the DIGIC Image Processor which actively reduces noise with high - speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot S100 incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 6400. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur. Canon Full HD Video Advantage : In addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot S100 makes it possible to shoot crisp clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24 frames per second the PowerShot S100 can also shoot 720p HD video at 30 frames per second. Dedicated Movie Button Wind Filter & Optical Zoom : Its never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot S100 has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly.

They would be correct in doing so. Designed for the working photographer , the D4 meets the most - demanding photog's needs and then some. Packed with features essential to getting the job done , and getting it done well this rig is more than a digital camera , it's a shooter's bread and butter. Building off the basic structure of its predecessor , the D4 goes big in a number of ways which are sure to be appreciated. The camera features a 16.2Mp 36 x 23.9mm CMOS sensor with Nikon's FX - format and the EXPEED3 image processor. ISO sensitivity can now be extended as low as ISO 50 or as high as 204 , 800 with a standard range of 100 - 12 , 800 ISO. Additionally , 10 frames per second continuous shooting in FX - format for up to 200 shots ensures the decisive moment will not be missed. The D4 records in RAW , JPEG , TIFF , and RAW + JPEG files. Metering options include RGB 3D Color Matrix III metering , center - weighted , and spot. Additionally , compatible storage media includes the future of professional storage , XQD memory cards , and Type I CompactFlash memory cards ( UDMA compliant ) . Of course , NIKKOR AF - S and AF - I lenses are compatible with the D4 body , putting an extensive line of lenses at the photographer's disposal. Another improvement on D4's little brother would be the slightly bigger LCD screen. Up from 3" , the D4 has a 3.2" LCD monitor with a 170° viewing angle , approximately 100% frame coverage , automatic monitor brightness control , and Live View. In Live View the image can be enlarged up to 46x to make on the spot focus confirmation. Surrounding the monitor are illuminated buttons for ease of use even in low light. Additionally , quick access Live View confirms exposure , white balance , monitor hue , histogram , focus mode , AF area mode , and focusing accuracy with ease. The D4 also boasts stellar auto focus features - like 51 AF points , an AF mode selector switch , and fast AF point selection. All three of these components of the AF system ensure accurate , fast shooting whether the subject is a room full of children or a high - speed sporting event. Of course , the D4 wouldn't be a professional level DSLR if it didn't include full HD video capture. The D4 does so , making it equally a pro videographer's tool as much as a pro photographer's. From 1080p broadcast quality video at 30 or 24 fps to full manual control to the option to add an external mic for stereo audio capture , the D4 isn't just a digital camera that also captures video. Features like the aforementioned Live View allow the videographer to confirm capture of their footage on the camera's LCD and an external ( optional ) monitor simultaneously.

The 60D is compatible with all Canon EF and EF - S lenses ; Canon has paired this 18 - 135mm model up with the 60D camera body , making for a value - packed kit that'll have you shooting from day one ( everybody say yay! ) . The 18 - 135mm is a great starter lens that gives you a wide zoom range with which to shoot - capture those close , close - ups all the way out to breath - taking , far - reaching vistas - all with this single lens. What was that? Did I say video? Yes , I did. Let's take a moment to delve into the feature that has all those techies out there jumping out of their desk chairs. The 60D is more than your run - of - the - mill DSLR camera , as we know ; it doubles as a 1920 x 1080 HD video camera. With the built - in video camera you'll be able to capture MOV video clips up to 4GB in size ( time depends on resolution ) . With features like manual exposure control , the option to attach on any of the Canon EF or EF - S lenses , and various audio adjustments - including an external stereo mic connection , and both manual and auto gain control - the 60D puts DSLR film - making at your fingertips. Other noteworthy features of the video function include in - camera editing , a number of recording resolutions to choose from , and an HDMI output for one - cable connection to your HDTV.

It also boasts a short total length of lens unit despite its higher versatility with longer zoom range , which is made possible by a development of new mechanism for a structure of lens barrel. The lens system is also compatible with high shutter speed of 1 / 4 , 000 sec. Nano Surface Coating Technology The newly applied Nano Surface Coating boasts an extremely low reflectance ratio compared with the conventional multi coating to suppress ghosting. With this Panasonic's black box technology , the image delivered through the lens of the DMC - ZS10 has exceptional optical performance with stunning clarity that passes Leica's stringent standards. Powerful 16x Optical Zoom The DMC - ZS10 features a powerful 16x optical zoom lens ( 35mm camera equivalent : 24 - 384mm ) . This gives you highly natural expressions from people and animals that you can't get close to. It can also be used for shooting movies , and is designed to suppress noise while zooming. This slim , compact , pocket - sized camera can easily go wherever you do - for both everyday snapshots and traveling. 24mm Ultra Wide - angle Lens The 24mm ultra wide - angle lens - rare on a compact camera - gives you a wider range of composition possibilities with approx. 213% larger viewing space compared to that of 35mm camera. The super - high - quality LEICA DC lens minimizes distortion at the wide end. 21x Intelligent Zoom / 33.8x Extra Optical Zoom Thanks to the Intelligent Resolution technology , the Intelligent Zoom is available with the DMC - ZS10 which extends the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x maintaining the picture quality even combining a digital zoom. This means the 16x optical can virtually extend to 21x equivalent. Furthermore , the Extra Optical Zoom function that extends zoom power to 33.8x by using the center part of the large MOS sensor to bring subjects even closer. 14.1 - Megapixel MOS Sensor The new 14.1 - megapixel MOS sensor integrated in the DMC - ZS10 boasts high speed signal output and high sensitivity image recording for making many advanced features possible. It also enables the camera to record full HD 60i ( NTSC )/ 50i ( PAL ) smooth movie. For the effective concentration of light , the newly developed sensor adopts microfabrication technology to achieve even higher sensitivity. With an advanced micro light tube structure , both color mixture and signal loss are prevented. The result is that the photo and movie shot at any sensitivity from low to high have outstanding clearness. Furthermore , optimization of semiconductor production process achieves dramatic suppression of noise. Together with the picture parameter setting suitable for the MOS sensor , the stunningly clear image rendered by the DMC - ZS10 boasts high picture quality with minimum noise. High - speed Consecutive Shooting The high speed digital signal output technology integrated in the cameras of LUMIX G Micro System is applied realizing the high speed consecutive shooting. It lets the DMC - ZS10 shoot 10 fps in 14 - megapixel full resolution with mechanical shutter and 5 fps with continuous AF. Even higher speed burst shooting is available with the DMC - ZS10 if electronic shutter is used - 60 fps in 3.5 - megapixel. In addition , the high speed movie at 220 fps in QVGA size is another advantage of the sensor which captures the motion of a subject. The frame rate , AF setting and the recording resolution can be easily selected according to the movement of the subject. 10 fps in 14.1MP Full Resolution The DMC - ZS10 can fire off up to approx. 10 frames per second in full 14 - megapixel resolution with its mechanical shutter. Great for capturing fast subject motion , such as sports scenes or birds in flight. 5fps / 2fps With Continuous AF The DMC - ZS10 lets you snap off consecutive shots at approx. 5 frames per second or 2 frames per second with continuous AF. That keeps the focus on quickly moving children for capturing decisive moments with crisp clarity. 60fps in 3.5MP Resolution Even higher - speed burst shooting is possible with the DMC - ZS10 when the electronic shutter is used - 60 fps at 3.5 - megapixel resolution. Great for capturing race cars and other fast - moving subjects. Intelligent Burst Mode The Intelligent Burst Mode in the iA Mode adjusts the frame rate of burst shooting according to the speed of the subject's movement. If the movement of the subject is not so fast , the camera shoots at regular frame rate and it moves fast , the camera increases the frame rate accordingly. High - Speed Movie at 220fps in QVGA Size This function lets you record high - speed movies at 220 frames per second in QVGA size ( 320 x 240 pixels ) . That means you can capture the moment the soccer ball finds the net. Or the moment that a tennis racket strikes the ball. You can even capture scenes that can't be seen with the naked eye , and play them back in dramatic slow motion. Sonic Speed AF The Sonic Speed AF system includes numerous re - engineering enhancements , including a higher - speed actuator , optimized algorithms and parallel software processing. The result is fast and accurate AF performance. In addition , the DMC - ZS10 features dramatically speedier focusing that is approx. 49% faster than our previous model. You can quickly focus on moving subjects , such as when you're shooting sports scenes. Short Release Time Lag The shutter release time lag is as short as approx. 0.007 second , making it easy to capture sudden , spur - of - the - moment photo opportunities. Venus Engine FHD For the image processor , the Venus Engine FHD is incorporated that features exceptionally advanced signal processing capabilities. By separating chromatic noise from luminance noise and applying the optimal noise reduction to each , you can capture clear and beautiful images even when shooting at high ISO sensitivity levels. The Venus Engine FHD also provides precisely selective noise reduction to the chromatic noise without affecting the border of colors which is judged from the brightness level of a pixel. Linking smoothly with the MOS sensor , the Venus Engine FHD processes a large amount of signals at high speed , making it possible to record high resolution consecutive shots and full HD movie recording. Intelligent Resolution Technology The advanced image processing technology "Intelligent Resolution" is incorporated in the Venus Engine FHD for the DMC - ZS10 ( TZ20 ) . With the Intelligent Resolution technology , 3 areas - outlines , detailed texture areas and soft gradation areas - are automatically detected and optimum signal processes are performed to each area. Apart from the uniform enhancement of sharpness , the innovative technology Intelligent Resolution precisely performs signal processing pixel by pixel in the most effective way for it.

Intelligent ISO Control - Motion Detection The Intelligent ISO Control function detects subject movement and automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the movement and light conditions.

By setting the camera to the Quick AF , images of sudden shooting opportunities won't be out of focus or blurry. Face Detection AF / AE with Face Recognition The DMC - ZS10 features the Face Recognition , a function that remembers faces. The conventional face detection system captures a face with focus and appropriate exposure but sometimes it falls not on the face you want to capture most beautifully when there are several faces in a frame. The Face Recognition prioritizes focus and exposure right on the face of your special person. In playback , you can choose to display only photos that contain a specific registered face using the Category Playback.The Face Detection also features the Digital Red - eye Correction ( Red - eye Removal ) . The camera takes care of the red - eye effect that often happens when shooting with a flash , to ensure attractive facial expression. Intelligent Scene Selector - Scene Detection When the camera's in the iA Mode , the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to one of Scenery , Portrait , Macro , Night Portrait , Night Scenery , Sunset or Intelligent Handheld Nightshot. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance. You are free from annoying settings every time scene changes when taking images with these most frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results even before you know it.

Just set the Canon PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture - taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers , a captivating sunset , or your friends at the park , you can be confident that you're getting dramatic , memorable images. Shooting Modes Advanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 20 Shooting Modes , you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. Large , crisp 2.5 - inch PureColor LCD II and wide viewing angle. The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.5 - inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon's PureColor LCD II offers spectacular color , resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch - resistant , anti - reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light - a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self - timer. Canon's most advanced image processor , DIGIC 4 , delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you're ready to shoot , then delivers perfect focus. In addition , exposure , flash and white balance are compensated , so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene - recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos , iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy , as well as exposure and white balance. A Face Detection Self - timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance , to include the photographer's face in a group shot , there's no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod , specify Face Detection Self - timer , and the camera will wait for the photographer's face to get on - camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range , and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway - allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Intelligent Contrast Correction DIGIC 4 also makes possible the i - Contrast ( Intelligent Contrast Correction ) system , which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark , and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can even use i - Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. Red - eye Correction provides three options for removing red - eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1 ) Red - eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red - eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2 ) The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red - eye during image playback. 3 ) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen , and command the camera to remove them. Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low - light situations , giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode.</DIV></DIV>

With powerful features like Full HD movie for high quality movies , low light performance for improved image clarity , 10 fps to capture the precise moment , and 3D still image capture for a new way to experience your pictures , you wouldn't believe something so compact could be this powerful. Features : 16.2 Megapixel Back - illuminated "Exmor R" CMOS Image Sensor The DSC - WX9 features a 16.2 megapixel "Exmor R" CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera's Carl Zeiss Vario - Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed , high resolution , and stunning low - light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition , the combined "Exmor R" CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps , Anti Motion Blur , Hand - held Twilight and 1080i movie modes. 3.0" XtraFine 3.0" ( 920K ) XtraFine technology gives you brilliant - quality still images and movies with easy focus. Full HD 1080 / 60i Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 AVCHD ( 3 ) . This provides stunning , fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV. 3D still image and panorama Produce awe - inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities4. Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way. iSweep Panorama With iSweep Panorama just press the shutter , pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion. Background Defocus DSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background , putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point - and - shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots , identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear. Backlight Correction HDR Don't miss a single detail in high contrast shots. The built in backlight correction analyzes the image and automatically adjusts accordingly to give you a perfectly lit shot. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of each into a single image for more natural looking shots. Superior Auto mode Get cleaner , more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode , then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity , optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies , making it easy to get the best shot. Digital Zoom Capturing the right shot at the right moment has never been so easy. Digital zoom brings the action up close to get that perfect shot , every time. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization Optical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built - in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. Soft Skin mode Portrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. Natural Flash Conventional point - and - shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color , for far more lifelike images. Carl Zeiss Vario - Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 5x Optical Zoom The high - performance Carl Zeiss Vario - Tessar 5x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor , sports , and travel photos , and Close Focus shoots close - ups up to just under 1 / 2" from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide - angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces. HDMI output The High - Definition Multimedia Interface ( HDMI ) is a compact audio / video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio / video sources such as a compatible camcorder , Blu - ray Disc player , a personal computer , a video game console , or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and / or video monitor such as a digital television ( DTV ) . Easily connect your Cyber - shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content6. Smile Shutter technology Smile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene , even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. Face Detection technology Sony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash , focus , exposure , and white balance to help deliver crisp , properly lit images of family and friends. Motion Detection Motion Detection , along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected , reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. Anti - blink Function It's frustrating to capture the perfect shot , only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap , the Anti - blink function captures two images , recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes , a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. Sweep Multi Angle mode In Sweep Multi Angle mode , the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback , the camera's Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D - like view on the camera's LCD. Anti - Motion Blur Mode Capture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti - motion Blur Mode , the DSC - WX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur , beyond the capability of traditional cameras. TransferJet technology TransferJet technology , developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies , allows you to transfer up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together , without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing5 . Compatible with PC and MAC Systems The high definition , AVCHD , video captured with the DSC - WX9 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie ( sold separately ) for Mac systems ( 2 ) .

Welcome to the next generation of digital SLR photography - the Canon EOS 40D. The EOS 40D combines Canon's tremendous know - how in both the digital and photographic worlds , creating a camera that not only does everything one would expect of a traditional digital SLR , but one that incorporates staggering leaps forward in technological innovation. With new features like Canon's EOS Integrated Cleaning System , Live View Function , a more powerful DIGIC III Image Processor , plus a 10.1 - megapixel CMOS sensor , a 3.0 - inch LCD monitor and more , the EOS 40D elevates digital photography to new heights , enhancing the shooting experience , and delivering images one could only expect from a Canon. Huge Sensor for Tremendous Photographs - Superb image quality : 10.1 Megapixel CMOS Sensor , extensive noise reduction technology , and 14 - bit conversion for outstanding color tones and gradations. Canon's large - area CMOS ( complementary metal oxide semiconductor ) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range , and offers the most pixels in its class. This APS - C size sensor ( 22.5 x 15.0mm ) has the same 3 : 2 ratio as film cameras , enabling an effective angle of view that is 1.6x the normal EF Lens focal length. 14 - bit A / D conversion means fine transitions from light to dark tones , and a significant drop in digital and shadow noise. The EOS 40D has an extensive ISO range ( from 100 to 1600 , plus ISO 3200* in extended mode ) which is selectable in 1 / 3 stop increments. The EOS 40D's CMOS sensor uses much of the new technology first seen in the EOS - 1D Mark III camera. New manufacturing techniques mean each pixel is more sensitive to light , and less area between pixels is wasted on the sensor. The on - chip noise reduction electronics are also entirely new , and combine with the sensor's general design for less digital noise and better high - ISO performance than ever before. This results in larger , clearer , sharper and more detailed photographs right from the start. * Standard output sensitivity. Recommended exposure index. The Speed to Capture Anything You Can Imagine. Outstanding performance : 6.5 fps , burst rate up to 75 consecutive JPEGs or 17 RAW images and DIGIC III Image Processor. Developed to maximize performance between the capture and recording stages of digital photography , the EOS 40D's DIGIC III processor is faster and more powerful than ever. The latest - generation DIGIC III Image Processor works in concert with Canon's CMOS sensor to achieve even higher levels of performance. The entire electronic system is totally re - designed , giving the camera its incredible combination of speed and image quality. Digital noise is significantly reduced in shadow areas , and color reproduction is superior. The EOS 40D is one of the fastest digital SLRs offered at this price. It shoots up to 6.5 fps , making it ideal for everything from wildlife to sports. It can capture up to 75 JPEGs , or 17 RAW images in one burst. Whether it's the 0.15 - second startup time , the high - speed mirror drive , the brief shutter lag time ( only 59 msec ), or the predictive AF focusing for capturing the action , the EOS 40D will amaze and delight photographers who don't want to wait for their camera when they're ready to shoot. The Strength to Handle Anything - Strong , rugged build quality : magnesium - alloy exterior , shutter durability - tested to 100 , 000 cycles , top speed 1 / 8000 , top x - sync speed 1 / 250. Solid Build - The EOS 40D has a solid , substantial feel that complements its compact dimensions. Designed to withstand the rigors of everyday use , the EOS 40D's exterior is constructed with lightweight and ultra - rigid magnesium - alloy that fits perfectly in the hands of the photographer. Rugged Shutter - The EOS 40D is designed to perform flawlessly , again and again. It has an improved high - speed and durable shutter unit , designed to respond in an instant , reaching a top shutter speed of 1 / 8000 sec. and tested to a remarkable 100 , 000 - cycle shutter life. A top flash sync speed of 1 / 250 sec. ensures full flash flexibility in bright or dim light. Sharp , Fast Focus , No Matter the Light - New AF system with 9 cross - type sensors , and world's first diagonal high - precision cross - type AF at center point with f / 2.8 and faster lenses. The EOS 40D takes some of the most advanced features from Canon's professional cameras and incorporates them into its design. It has a newly designed , high - precision 9 - point wide area AF that uses cross - type points with lenses f / 5.6 or faster , enabling the camera to focus faster , more accurately , and in ever more complex lighting. Each of the nine AF points has this cross - type coverage , a first in Canon AF SLRs. Adding to this AF performance , the 40D incorporates a diagonally mounted , high - precision cross - type sensor at the center AF point that is sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines when fast lenses ( f / 2.8 or faster ) are used , for for added accuracy and precision with these wide - aperture lenses. It's the world's first AF SLR where both lines of a cross - type sensor offer high - precision AF coverage. All focus points can be chosen automatically , or accessed using the 40D's intuitive , thumb operated Multi - Controller. Spot Metering - The EOS 40D also includes a spot meter function that measures roughly 3.5% of the center of the image.This new metering function , added to Canon's impressive Evaluative , Center Weighted averaged and Partial - metering modes , gives the photographer even more choices for custom - tailored shooting. Highlight Tone Priority - This vital Custom Function lets photographers get even better detail in bright highlights , even in contrasty lighting conditions. It's beneficial for nearly any type of picture , from mid - day shots on a safari to portraits in sunlight , where a user may encounter bright highlight areas where he or she wants to preserve details. Finally , there's no impact on the camera's shooting speed or burst rate when Highlight Tone Priority is engaged. It takes full advantage of the EOS 40D's new 14 - bit per channel conversion , meaning there are 16 , 384 distinct tones from darkest to lightest in each color channel. The Promise of Perfect Images - EOS Integrated Cleaning System , Picture Style settings , Spot metering , and Highlight Tone Priority for advanced in - camera image control. EOS Integrated Cleaning System - Photographers who must change lenses in dusty environments will find the advanced Canon EOS Integrated Cleaning System a tremendous time saver. Dust that settles on the sensor surface is removed using ultrasonic vibration. This Self Cleaning Sensor Unit routine is automatically activated whenever the camera is powered on or off. ( It can also be manually activated. ) A special collar positioned around the sensor collects the loosened dust. Dust particles can also be automatically removed via software. By shooting a plain white subject , the photographer can acquire dust position data that is transmitted along with the image ( whether JPEG or RAW ) . Canon Digital Photo Professional ( DPP ) version 3.1 or higher software can then be used to manually or automatically erase the dust spots. It's not one feature , it's a built - in system to minimize the effect of dust in high - resolution digital images. Self Cleaning Sensor Unit - A key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat against this , the EOS 40D features a Canon - designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low - pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations , removing dust from the sensor assembly. Dust Delete Data Detection - Dust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional ( DPP ) Version 3.1 or higher. A simple test shot of a plain , white object can be taken , using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in - camera , and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image , whether JPEG or RAW , and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon's DPP version 3.1 and up. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image , perfect for printing or archiving. Picture Style settings - With Picture Style technology and the EOS 40D , photographers can recreate characteristics of their favorite films. Color , saturation , sharpness and contrast settings create noticeable variation in the saved image. In addition to six preset Picture Style settings ( Standard , Portrait , Landscape , Neutral , Faithful and Monochrome ), users can create three additional settings for their particular photographic style. Picture Style Settings Setting Description Saturation Sharpness Standard ( default setting ) Vivid , sharp images ; usable in a wide variety of conditions ; optimal for direct printing without post - processing. High Slightly High Portrait Warmer skin tones , with slightly more contrast than Neutral. Slightly High Slightly Low Landscape Extremely bright , saturated and sharpened images , with emphasis on blue and green color saturation. High Green - Blue High Neutral Low sharpening , contrast and saturation : the ideal starting point for image - editing in the computer. Low None Faithful Accurate reproduction of the subject's colors based on colorimetric data ; assumes 5500K light source. Low None Monochrome Black & White images ; adjustable contrast , sharpening , as well as color toning and effects of traditional color filters. None ( Monochrome ) Slightly High The most diverse composing options available in digital photography - Large 3.0 - inch LCD monitor and advanced Live View Function with new options for reduced shutter time lag and quiet operation. Live View Function is a powerful feature on the EOS 40D. It enables viewing your subjects directly on the huge 3 - inch LCD monitor. It's easy to magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. But now , one press of the AF - on button gives instant access to AF ; Live View Function returns as soon as the button is released. Users can even choose a grid overlay , perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In the Studio , Live View Function can be used remotely via a computer through the EOS 40D's USB connection , or wirelessly or via Ethernet with the Wireless File Transmitter WFT - E3A attached. Live View Function also adds a totally new method for near - silent shooting , with two silent shooting modes. A new AF ON button , positioned for easy reach with the right thumb , can instantly allow AF whenever it's depressed in Live View Function. ( Live View Function is temporarily cleared for AF , and returns immediately when the user's thumb is removed from the button. ) Shooting and Sharing Made Easy - Wide range of accessories , including interchangeable focusing screens , extensive remote control options , and new battery grip BG - E2N. EF & EF - S Lenses - EOS 40D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF - S lineup , ranging from ultra - wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron - precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies , such as Aspherical , ultra - low dispersion , or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L Series lenses , and Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses minimizes the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses , photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS 40D. Flash Photography - The EOS 40D features the acclaimed E - TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line , E - TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill - in flash pictures in sunlight , or using flash in total darkness. With E - TTL II , the exact same 35 - zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering - giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering , there's a menu setting to change to Average flash meteringwhere the entire 35 - zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. Canon's Speedlite 580EX II is perfectly suited to the EOS 40D. It has improved reliability of communications through the direct contacts , has a metal flash foot , and is dust - and water - resistant. Other new features include a PC socket on the flash unit , and an external metering sensor for non - TTL auto flash if desired. With the EOS 40D , you can set most flash settings directly from the camera's menus. It has the same power as the previous Speedlite 580EX ( maximum guide number of 190 ft. / 58m at ISO 100 ) and , when mounted on the camera , automatically compensates for the camera's sensor size , enabling high output flash , with more flashes per charge. It includes an AF - assist Beam , which works in conjunction with the EOS 40D's focusing system , and automatically sends color temperature information to the camera when the flash fires , for more accurate white balance rendition with flash photography Software - Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk ( Version 15.0 ) The EOS 40D comes bundled with an updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk , which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's ZoomBrowser EX for Windows® ( Version 5.8 ), ImageBrowser for Macintosh® OS X ( Version 5.8 ), Digital Photo Professional ( Version 3.1 ), the totally new Picture Style Editor ( Version 1.0 ), Canon's EOS Utility ( Version 2.1 ), RAW Image Task ( Version 2.7 ), PhotoStitch , and PTP TWAIN Driver. Each application is designed to perfect captured images and streamline the digital workflow. ZoomBrowser EX v.5.8 and Digital Photo Professional v.3.1 for Windows are compatible with the new Windows Vista operating system , too. Digital Photo Professional ( Version 3.1 ) - is an image processing program that enables high - speed RAW image processing , high - speed previewing for real - time image adjustment and support for sRGB , Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it's CMS ( Color Management System ) compatible , Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy - PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images.

Harrison Ford stars as Captain Alexi Vostrikov , a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine , K - 19 , at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander , Captain Mikhail Polenin Liam Neeson has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment , but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. Polenin's concerns are well founded : parts are not yet installed , equipment is missing , and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway , for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success , but a disastrous leak in the K - 19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload -- which would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III. With no other option , Vostrikov orders his men to repair the damage in ten - minute shifts , irradiating them hopelessly. The conflict between the seemingly bureaucratic Communist Vostrikov and the more humane Polenin escalates , until a surprising twist reveals where both officers' loyalties truly lie.

The F2.0 lens is about twice as bright as the F2.8 lens , itself generally considered a bright lens. The result is a higher shutter speed can be used to capture stunningly clear , sharp , blur - free images in lower lighting situation. This advanced lens also makes it easy to produce beautiful photos with pleasing soft - focused background thanks to the shallow depth of field provided by the extra light. Also , the 24mm ultra - wide - angle lens - rare on a compact camera - gives photographers a wider range of composition possibilities. The super - high - quality LEICA DC VARIO - SUMMICRON lens minimizes distortion at the wide end , so users can get stunning , true - to - life images with outstanding resolution and detail. The LX5 captures approx. 213% larger viewing space compared to that of normal 35mm cameras , and approx. 136% larger compared to that of 28mm wide - angle lenses. *35mm film camera equivalent : 24 - 90mm 1 / 1.63 - inch 10.1 - megapixel High Sensitivity CCD with Wider Dynamic Range The predecessor DMC - LX3 played a big role to cease the pixel count war by adopting 1 / 1.63 - inch CCD for 10.1 - megapixel recording to realize the unprecedented picture quality with a compact digital camera and even to establish a new premium compact camera category in the market. The CCD in the LX3 , which was highly acclaimed from specialists worldwide , is redesigned to achieve further expansion of dynamic range by increasing the sensitivity by approx. 31% and the saturation by approx.38%*. It is made possible by the improvement of on - tip - lens design with larger light concentration and VCCD expansion while deepening the photo diode to manage richer signal more effectively. The result is a high resolution , noise - less pictures even in high sensitivity recording and richly reproduced gradation in highly contrasted situations with the exquisitely wide dynamic range. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity CCD and the brightness of the lens , minimum illumination of DMC - LX5 is as low as 3 lux in movie recording. *Panasonic in - house comparison with DMC - LX3. Save Memories in Movie - Start Enjoying Videography As You Enjoy Photography In addition to Motion JPEG images , the DMC - LX5 can record high - definition motion picture in AVCHD Lite. It features almost doubling the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format. The picture quality is greatly enhanced thanks to the newly added Intelligent Resolution technology. The LX5 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio. In movie recording , the DMC - LX5 goes further than simply recording HD movies. Apart from the movie recording capability of conventional digital compact cameras , the DMC - LX5 also features a Creative Movie mode , which lets the user set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies , which is especially suitable for shooting fast - moving subject. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances and it is desired to have each of them stand out. My Color mode is also available in movie recording. *Continuous recording exceeding 2GB is not possible when recording motion JPEG. Remaining time for continuous recording is displayed on the screen. *Use a card with SD Speed Class with "Class 4" or higher when recording motion pictures in [ AVCHD Lite ] . Also , use a card with SD Speed Class with "Class 6" or higher when recording motion pictures in [ MOTION JPEG ] . *SD Speed Class is the speed standard regarding continuous writing.</DIV></DIV>

Powered by two AA batteries , the A730 even has an SD / SDHC memory card slotexpandable up to an amazing 4 gigabytes. Youll be hard pressed to find a more feature - rich entry - level camera. And thats why the A730 is one of the first cameras worthy of the GE name. FEATURES : 7.0 Megapixels : A megapixel ( one million pixels ) is a unit of image - sensing capacity in a digital camera. A pixel - shorthand for ""picture element"" - is the basic unit of programmable color on a computer display or in a computer image. In general , the more megapixels in a camera , the better the resolution when making larger prints. 3x Optical Zoom : Optical zoom is basically what is found in a regular 35mm camera : When the button is pushed to zoom in or out , physical lens elements move inside the camera to achieve the desired effect. Optical zoom lenses actually move you closer to the subject of the photograph. The higher the optical zoom rating on a camera , the farther away you can be to take a photograph and still get a clear , close - up image. 2.5"" LCD : Digital cameras use the LCD screen as a viewfinder by providing a live video feed of the scene to be captured. The LCDs normally measure between 1.5"" and 2.5"" diagonally ( our LCDs measure 2.5 to 3 inches ) with typical resolutions between 120 , 000 and 240 , 000 pixels. Electronic Image Stabilization : Image Stabilization automatically overcomes shaking or blurring caused by accidental hand movement , helping you take clearer , sharper pictures. Face Detection : The camera detects faces in a scene and then automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for them. This technology helps when taking pictures of large groups , when a person is in the distance or when the subject moves into the frame. Even if a person moves , the camera will stay focused on the face and adjust exposure. A person's face must be looking towards the camera for face - recognition AF / AE to work effectively. It also works best when taking photos in good light. 1600 ISO : ISO denotes how sensitive the image sensor is to the amount of light present. The higher the ISO , the more sensitive the image sensor , which means improved ability to take pictures in low - light situations. With film cameras , you have to physically change to a different roll of film if you want a different ISO speed. Digital technology allows you to simply dial to another ISO rating , letting you record images taken at different ISO speeds on the same memory card. Panorama : Panorama stitching. Allows for the creation of ultra - wide panoramic shots. Wide - view photos are produced by stitching three images into a single panoramic picture , providing an image that is wider than would be possible with a standard lens. Red - Eye Removal : Red - eye removal provides users a tool to remove the appearance of red eyes in subjects , which sometimes occurs when pictures are taken using the flash. IN THE BOX : AA Alkaline Batteries USB Cable AV Cable Wrist Strap CD - ROM Manuals Quick Start Guide Warranty Card</DIV></DIV>

The 19mm slim COOLPIX S3000 features quality materials and construction that are instantly recognizable when taken into the hand. And with the COOLPIX S3000 available in a diverse selection of attractive colors , its the perfect tool to express personal style. Plus simple operation of advanced functions in its slim design makes it a pleasure to carry around anywhere. Outstanding imaging ability begins with 12.0 effective megapixels of sharp resolution with an optimized processing system to faithfully reproduce fine details and subtle tones , deliver quick response , and maintain image quality and clarity when taking advantage of extended light sensitivity settings as high as ISO 3200. The COOLPIX S3000 is also equipped with a precision 4x zoom , NIKKOR lens that employs six aspherical surfaces ably covers focal lengths from 27 - 108mm ( 35mm format equivalent ) allowing flexibility in shooting subjects near or far. Nikon COOLPIX S3000 Feature Highlights EXPEED digital imaging technology Nikons smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing , Nikons comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture - taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine ; it is a revolution in digital photography. Four advanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results Nikon's Electronic VR image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. ISO 3200 capability allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast - moving subjects. And , Nikons original BSS ( Best Shot Selector ) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus. * The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image. Intelligent automation contributes to carefree shooting Nikons Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot , and this makes it faster and easier to capture the moment in beautiful fashion. The COOLPIX S3000 uses this intelligent function to analyze the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results  Portrait , Landscape , Night Portrait , Night Landscape , Close - up , or Backlight. Nikons exclusive Smart Portrait System Automatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot , Face - priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the priority subject smiles and offers the Blink Proof function , which automatically shoots two sequential frames and saves the one in which the subjects eyes are open - wide. Now featuring faster processing speed , In - Camera Red - Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red - eye effect before saving the image to memory. Subject Tracking Subject tracking automatically detects a human face and then continues to track and focus on that subject. Particularly useful when capturing children as they move naturally , Subject Tracking even functions if the subject moves out of the frame and returns within three seconds. Nikon COOLPIX S3000 Other Features 16 scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings Scene Auto Selector D - Lighting Auto Sort function Up to 1.6 hours* of movie shooting at 640 x 480 ( 30 fps ) Quick Retouch Approx. 47 MB of internal memory USB charging via Charging AC Adapter EH - 68P / EH - 68P ( AR ) or PC * Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes , or after the file size reaches 2 GB. This figure is based on in - house testing standards and stated for recording at 25°C ( 77°F ) with a fully charged EN - EL10 battery. Actual results may vary greatly depending on factors that include differences in ambient temperature , and the amount of zoom and autofocus operations used.</DIV></DIV>

Features 3x optical zoom , 5.1x digital zoom , a high - performance 2 - 1 / 2" LCD , and a simple , intuitive user interface. When you look at everything that the GE A830 can do , you'll be impressed , and when you compare its price against those of similar cameras , you'll be amazed. This sleek and powerful point - and - shoot camera is loaded with the features amateur photographers want most. The A830 provides great extras such as in - camera panoramic stitching , red - eye removal , electronic stabilization , and movie recording. Plus its memory is expandable up to 4GB using its SD / SDHC memory slot. Image stabilization automatically overcomes shaking or blurring caused by accidental hand movement , helping you take clearer , sharper pictures. Using face - tracking technology , the camera automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for the faces in your shot. This technology helps when taking pictures of large groups , when a person is in the distance or when the subject moves into the frame. Even if a person moves , the camera will stay focused on the face and adjust exposure. A person's face must be looking towards the camera for face - recognition AF / AE to work effectively. It also works best when taking photos in good light. Ounce for ounce , you won't find a better value in an 8MP camera. And that's why the A830 is one of the first cameras worthy of the GE name. Available in a variety of colors.</DIV></DIV>

Face Detection 2.0 The Next Generation Fujifilm's proprietary Face Detection Technology also gets an upgrade in the F50fd with the arrival of Face Detection 2.0 , featuring Automatic Red Eye Removal.  As with the original version of Face Detection , it can detect up to 10 human faces in a scene in as little as 5 / 100's of a second , correcting focus , exposure , and white balance automatically , regardless of where subjects are located within the frame.  Face Detection 2.0 adds to this technology by being able to identify faces at much more extreme camera angles than before.  No longer does the camera need a head - on shot to identify a face , because now even a profile will do  with up to 90O movement in either direction for profiles , and up to 135O for leaning or lying down in either direction , for a total range of 270O. Additional improvements to Face Detection 2.0 include a new Automatic Red - Eye Removal feature that automatically corrects red - eye directly after the shot is taken and then saves both the original and the corrected image file. Dual Image Stabilization To ensure that users achieve even greater blur - free pictures , the FinePix F50fd adds to Fujifilm's Picture Stabilization mode to create the improved Dual Image Stabilization mode. This combines a mechanically stabilized CCD sensor with high ISO sensitivities for Total Anti - Blur protection.  The combination of these two different approaches reduces the "blur" ; effect from the photographer's hand - shake and subject movement even further to provide the highest quality digital pictures yet , with sharp , clean and clear results. Not much light? Not a Problem! All too often , digital photographers run into problems when taking pictures in low - light or dimly - lit situations and have to rely on the flash which can lead to over - exposed and washed - out shots. The FinePix F50fd builds on the great strides previous Fujifilm digicams have made with low light photography and allows users to effortlessly capture the moment as their eye sees it , with tremendous clarity and low noise , using Fujifilm's Real Photo technology. Thanks to the 7th generation FinePix Super CCD - HR chip and the RP Processor II , the Finepix F50fd can utilize ISO settings of up to ISO1600 at full resolution and an amazing ISO 6400 at reduced resolution1 , capturing stunning images even in low light while preserving the natural color and clarity of the shot. Features : Portrait Enhancer Mode :   Mimicking a professional photo studio setting , by using Face Detection and preset camera settings , Portrait Enhancer minimizes fine lines and small skin blemishes for smooth , natural looking portraits. Dual Shot Mode : In this selectable mode , the FinePix F50fd quickly shoots two images in rapid succession -- one with the flash and one without  and saves both. This convenient function lets the user perform a comparison at their convenience and select the most pleasing image. i - Flash Intelligent Flash : i - Flash ( Intelligent Flash ) detects subtle lighting differences within a scene and then varies the flash intensity accordingly. It also leverages the high sensitivity of the FinePix F50fd to enable the camera to use less flash , resulting in an image that displays pleasing , natural tones without a "washed - out" ; effect.  And with an automatic pop - up flash , it's always ready when you need it. Full Manual Photographic Control :   Gives the user total control with manual adjustment options for settings on the camera ( resolution , ISO , aperture , shutter speed , etc ), and is desirable by the photo enthusiasts / advanced photographers. GUI Micro Thumbnail : A new playback feature that allows for viewing an index print on the LCD.  The F50fd will show up to 100 images in micro form , then the control buttons are used to move over specific images and select them.  This makes it easy to quickly find a single image by being able to jump to particular segments of images in the time sequence.  So rather than using the left / right arrows to move through one image at a time , you can move up / down / left / right and then select the image you want to view.  The back button takes you back to the thumbnail view in one step.  The micro view lets you get close to the image you want , and then scroll to find the specific picture.  As memory cards become larger , and devices become as much about sharing images as capturing them , this is a handy feature to enable the user to find specific images quicker. IrSimpleTM : Infrared communication via IrSimpleTM technology for fast , easy wireless image transfer to a compatible device. Special Scene and Blog Modes : The FinePix F50fd has 16 pre - programmed scenes , including a special underwater scene mode for use with a special underwater casing.  In the Blog mode , the FinePix F50fd copies and automatically reduces the size of copied images for easy posting to a blog , Web page or as an attachment to email for easy sharing with friends and family while maintaining the original file. xD / SD / SD - HC Compatible slot : The FinePix F50fd features a "xD / SD Compatible slot" ; which accepts not only Fujifilm's traditional xD - Picture Cards but also Secure Digital ( SD ) and SD - High Capacity / SD - HC cards too. Battery Life : Long - life rechargeable Li - ion battery ( up to 230 shots ) .   Specifications : CCD Sensor 1 / 1.6 - inch Super CCD HR Number of Effective Pixels 12 million pixels Number of Recorded Pixels Still image : 4 , 000 x 3 , 000 / 4 , 224x 2 , 816 ( 3 : 2 format ) / 2 , 848 x 2 , 136 / 2 , 048 x 1 , 536 / 1 , 600 x 1 , 200 / 640 X 480 pixels Image Processing Type Still image : JPEG ( Exif Ver 2.2 ) ( Design rule for Camera File system compliant / DPOF - compatible ) Movie : AVI ( Motion JPEG ) with sound Audio : WAVE format , Monaural sound File Formats Still image : JPEG ( Exif Ver 2.2 ) ( Design rule for Camera File system compliant / DPOF - compatible ) Movie : AVI ( Motion JPEG ) with sound Audio : WAVE format , Monaural sound Internal Memory Internal memory ( approx. 25MB ) Lens Fujinon 3 x Optical zoom lens , F2.8 - F5.1 Lens Focal Length ( Rated ) / ( 35mm Equiv. ) f = 8.0mm - 24.0mm , Equivalent to 35 - 105mm on a 35mm camera Aperture Range F2.8 - F8 Digital Zoom Approx 8.2x ( Max ) Focus Auto focus ( Area , Multi , Center )/ Continuous AF AF assist illuminator available Focusing Range Normal Normal : Wide angle : Approx. 45cm / 1.5 ft to infinity Telephoto : Approx. 60cm / 2.0 ft to infinity Macro  Close - up Macro : Wide Angle : Approx. 7cm / 2.8 in to 80cm / 2.6ft.

Powered by two AA batteries. . You want megapixels? The A835 has eight  you dont see that every day in a basic model. A simple , intuitive user interface makes the A835easy to use right out of the box. A 3X optical zoom and a 4.5X digital zoom capture superior close - ups. And a vibrant 2.5 - inch LCD screenmakes it easy to frame your subject and review your images. Packed inside its sleek and stylish camera body is a whole host of additional features like in - camera panoramic stitching , red - eye removal , facetracking , electronic stabilization and MPEG - 4 movie recording. Powered by two AA batteries , the A835 even has an SD / SDHC memory card slotexpandable up to an amazing 4 gigabytes. Youll be hard pressed to find a more feature - rich entry - level camera. And thats why the A835 is one of the first cameras worthy of the GE name. FEATURES : 8.0 Megapixels : A megapixel ( one million pixels ) is a unit of image - sensing capacity in a digital camera. A pixel - shorthand for ""picture element"" - is the basic unit of programmable color on a computer display or in a computer image. In general , the more megapixels in a camera , the better the resolution when making larger prints. 3x Optical Zoom : Optical zoom is basically what is found in a regular 35mm camera : When the button is pushed to zoom in or out , physical lens elements move inside the camera to achieve the desired effect. Optical zoom lenses actually move you closer to the subject of the photograph. The higher the optical zoom rating on a camera , the farther away you can be to take a photograph and still get a clear , close - up image. 2.5"" LCD : Digital cameras use the LCD screen as a viewfinder by providing a live video feed of the scene to be captured. The LCDs normally measure between 1.5"" and 2.5"" diagonally ( our LCDs measure 2.5 to 3 inches ) with typical resolutions between 120 , 000 and 240 , 000 pixels. Electronic Image Stabilization : Image Stabilization automatically overcomes shaking or blurring caused by accidental hand movement , helping you take clearer , sharper pictures. Face Detection : The camera detects faces in a scene and then automatically focuses and optimizes exposure for them. This technology helps when taking pictures of large groups , when a person is in the distance or when the subject moves into the frame. Even if a person moves , the camera will stay focused on the face and adjust exposure. A person's face must be looking towards the camera for face - recognition AF / AE to work effectively. It also works best when taking photos in good light. 1600 ISO : ISO denotes how sensitive the image sensor is to the amount of light present. The higher the ISO , the more sensitive the image sensor , which means improved ability to take pictures in low - light situations. With film cameras , you have to physically change to a different roll of film if you want a different ISO speed. Digital technology allows you to simply dial to another ISO rating , letting you record images taken at different ISO speeds on the same memory card. Panorama : Panorama stitching. Allows for the creation of ultra - wide panoramic shots. Wide - view photos are produced by stitching three images into a single panoramic picture , providing an image that is wider than would be possible with a standard lens. Red - Eye Removal : Red - eye removal provides users a tool to remove the appearance of red eyes in subjects , which sometimes occurs when pictures are taken using the flash.

Harrison Ford stars as Captain Alexi Vostrikov , a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine , K - 19 , at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander , Captain Mikhail Polenin Liam Neeson has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment , but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. Polenin's concerns are well founded : parts are not yet installed , equipment is missing , and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway , for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success , but a disastrous leak in the K - 19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload -- which would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III. With no other option , Vostrikov orders his men to repair the damage in ten - minute shifts , irradiating them hopelessly. The conflict between the seemingly bureaucratic Communist Vostrikov and the more humane Polenin escalates , until a surprising twist reveals where both officers' loyalties truly lie.
