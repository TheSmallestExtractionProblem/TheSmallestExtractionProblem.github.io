The folded optics technology makes it possible to fit the high performance lens in futuristic , flat body. The lens cover can be opened and closed with the touch of a finger , and also serves as a power switch.In iA ( Intelligent Auto ) mode , 4 detection functions work automatically and simultaneously to optimize your settings , making it easier than ever to take beautiful photos every time.To realize the sonic speed AF , a number of re - engineering and improvements are made including the adaptation of higher - speed actuator , the optimization of algorithms and the parallelization of software processing element. The result is ultra high speed yet accurate AF performance for users to enjoy the airy shooting that has experienced never before. Panasonic also replaced its linear program processing with parallel processing to achieve an ultra high - speed start - up time.The DMC - FP1 can record motion pictures in high - definition. The pixel mixed readout method enables bright motion - picture recording even in low - light settings.The DMC - FP1's large 2.7 - inch LCD features high 230 , 000 - dot resolution Intelligent LCD. It automatically adjusts the brightness in 11 steps according to shooting conditions. This LCD provides sharp , clear images in virtually all shooting situations , ranging from nighttime to bright daylight scenes. In addition , the high - angle mode makes the display extremely easy to view from a low angle , for example , when taking photos by raising your hand upward to capture the subject over the crowd. Product Features Enjoy your images in HD All Lumix cameras can take 16 : 9 HD ( high - definition ) quality photos that perfectly fit a wide - screen HDTV for full - screen viewing. You can enjoy slideshows of photos taken with the camera in stunning HD quality by inserting an SDHD / SD memory card in to the SDHC / SD card slot with the VIErA HDTV ( VIERA Image Viewer ) . Flat , futuristic design thanks to folding optics Folded optics is adopted to secure the toughness of the lens unit. Comprising 11 elements and a prism unit in 10 groups , including an ED lens and 4 aspherical lenses with 7 aspherical surfaces , this advanced lens unit renders high resolution image corner to corner even adopting the folded optics. Superb image quality The image - processing LSI , Venus Engine IV , features advanced signal processing technology for rendering high quality images. Featured in the new models , the multi - task image - processing engine Venus Engine IV supports a super - fast response time. Despite its outstanding performance , the high performance engine is also superior in its energy efficiency to feature a long battery life up to 300 shots ( CIPA ) per a single charge. Intelligently speaking As with all Panasonic's Lumix cameras , the FP models incorporate the sophisticated intelligent auto mode in pursuit of the ultimate ease of operation and the reduction of misshots. MEGA O.I.S. suppresses hand - shake and intelligent ISO control prevents moving subjects from being blurred by optimizing the shutter speed and ISO setting , to render sharp , clear images whatever the shooting situation is. Human faces are captured in focus and appropriate exposure with face detection. Unwanted red - eyes are digitally corrected and backlight compensation automatically activates if this happens. The quick AF system allows the camera to keep focus on the subject while the camera is in recording mode even before pressing the shutter button halfway , to get the best results from far moving subjects , because the focus is always near the subject and the AF time is minimized. Look at me The FP models incorporate an easy - to - see , 230 , 000 - dot intelligent LCD for comfortable viewing while both monitoring shots and playing back the results. The intelligent LCD function detects the light condition and automatically boosts the LCD backlighting by max. 40% when shooting outdoors in bright sunshine , and adjusts the frame rate when shooting in low - lit situations in addition to using the pixel mixed readout method to secure clarity in such situations. Detecting the lighting condition precisely and automatically controlling the brightness with a total of 11 fine steps , this function gives the display the most appropriate clarity in any situation without using extra energy. The high - angle mode makes the LCD screen extremely easy to view when the camera is held high , such as when shooting over a crowd.

Leading the list of features is a large , developed , ultra - sensitive CCD. And rather than simply maximizing the pixel count as other cameras do , the DMC - LX3 makes generous use of its 10.1 megapixels in this 1 / 1.63 - inch CCD. Each pixel is around 45% larger than those in ordinary 10 - megapixel cameras. This boosts both sensitivity and saturation by around 40% each compared to standard models. Its predecessor , the DMC - LX2 , also featured a large , 1 / 1.65 - inch CCD , but in comparison , the DMC - LX3 offers around 20% greater sensitivity and around 15% higher saturation performance than even the DMC - LX2 by maximizing the size of the photodiode in each photo cell. These CCD improvements also minimize noise generation in the DMC - LX3 , resulting in a 1.5 dB increase in the S / N ratio compared with the DMC - LX2. The DMC - LX3 is equipped with a 24 - 60mm f / 2.0â2.8 Leica DC VArio - Summicron lens. In order to meet stringent Leica performance standards while offering a 24mm ultra - wide - angle setting and a large F2.0 aperture that nearly doubles the brightness of even a "bright" F2.8 lens , the lens system employs 8 lens elements in 6 groups , including 4 aspherical lenses. This provides superb resolution while minimizing distortion and artifacts such as chromatic aberration , ghosting and flaring. Product Features A pleasure to own , a joy to use Designed for easy , creative shooting , and high - performance in low - light conditions , the DMC - LX3S features a F2.0 24mm Leica DC Vario - Summicron lens , 10.1 megapixels and an ultra - sensitive 1 / 1.63 - inch CCD developed specifically for this model. By combining a high - quality lens and sensor ready for a variety of shooting conditions with a wide - range of accessories and manual controls , the DMC - LX3S is ideal for professional photographers and serious amateurs looking for a compact digital camera that furthers their creative photography. The highest - quality images ever from a compact digital camera At the heart of the DMC - LX3S , is its 1 / 1.63 - inch CCD. Making the intentional choice to limit the number of megapixels to 10.1 on its CCD , Panasonic was able to give more space for each pixel and also redesigned the peripheral circuits and other components to further minimize noise generation. As a result , sensitivity is almost 40 percent higher and saturation is increased by 35 percent , when compared to Panasonic 10 MP digital cameras , giving the DMC - LX3S outstanding image quality and a wide dynamic range , and meeting the demand for a camera that works optimally in low - light environments. The CCD is also capable of reproducing images in three aspect ratios 4 : 3 , 3 : 2 or 16 : 9. The multi aspect mode allows the camera to take an image in all three aspect ratios simultaneously , allowing you to choose the version that best suits their needs. Large aperture F2.0 , 24mm wide - angle Another major upgrade to the DMC - LX3S is the F2.0 24mm ultra wide - angle Leica DC Vario - Summicron lens. The F2.0 is about twice as bright as a F2.8 lens and can shoot at higher shutter speeds to capture clear , blur - free images in dimly lit environments. In addition , the 24mm lens captures approximately a 213% larger viewing angle than a normal 35mm camera and 136% larger compared to a 28mm wide - angle lens. The lens unit consists of eight elements in six groups with four aspherical lenses with four aspherical surfaces. As a result of the F2.0 lens , the DMC - LX3S produces high resolution and minimal distortion and artifacts such as chromatic aberrations , ghosting and flaring.

Increasing the number of megapixels means enlarging and cropping will not adversely affect picture quality. With the 12.1 MP digital image sensor on this Panasonic DMC - GH1 digital camera , you can make wonderful prints as large as 11x16 inches. Be the envy of your friends with this Panasonic mirrorless interchangeable lens digital camera and its sophisticated black body.

In addition , this Panasonic DMC - GH1 digital camera makes it easy for you to extend the storage size of the camera thanks to its removable flash memory slot. This Panasonic mirrorless interchangeable lens digital camera comes with only the body and no lens. The main advantage to purchasing the camera body on its own is that you pick the best interchangeable lenses to get based on your expanding photography budget resources. Product Features Full - HD movie recording in AVCHD With the GH1 , shooting incredible photos is only part of the fun. You can also shoot beautiful , richly detailed movies in Full HD ( high - definition ) ( 1920 x 1080 ) at 24 frames per second , or smooth HD ( 1280 x 720 ) movies at 60 frames per second in AVCHD ( MPEG - 4 / H.264 ) with a continuous auto focus function. Just press the Motion Picture button on the back of the camera , and shooting begins. High - performance kit lens The GH1 kit is proudly equipped with the LUMIX G VARIO HD 14 - 140mm / F4.0 - 5.8 ASPH. / MEGA O.I.S. lens. This compact lens boasts a focal length of 28 - 280mm ( 35mm camera equivalent ) and supports a continuous auto focus function that works for both photos and movies. The aperture adaptively adjusts to each scene , letting you capture the kind of delicate , softly focused movies that only a digital interchangeable lens camera can produce.

( Optical Image Stabilizer ) that helps eliminate blurring from hand - shake. Enjoy the freedom of manual settings in creative movie mode The GH1 gives you more creative freedom. It lets you adjust the shutter speed and aperture any way you like when shooting movies. This gives you a wider range of expressive possibilities to explore in your movie making. iA mode - beautiful HD movies with point - and - shoot ease Just set the GH1 to iA mode , aim and shoot. The iA does all the rest. It automatically determines the most suitable Scene mode and helps correct blurring , focus , and brightness problems for bright , sharply focused HD movies. An audio performance that adds to your HD movies A stereo microphone , featuring Dolby Digital Stereo Creator , on the GH1's upper body records dynamic , true - to - life stereo audio that brings out the power of your HD movies. There is also a Wind Cut function that reduces noise on breezy days. The advanced iA mode uses Face Recognition to remember individual faces The GH1 features an enhanced version of LUMIX's clever iA mode that includes Face Recognition , a function that "remembers" registered faces. When there's a familiar face in the frame , it optimizes the focus and exposure so that the face is in sharp focus and bright. This newly evolved technology makes it easy to get beautiful photos of a loved one in a group of people. Developed 12.1 - megapixel live MOS sensor The GH1's 4 / 3 - type live MOS sensor with 12.1 - megapixels gives you the best of both worlds : the superior image quality and the lower power consumption. It also adds a high - speed readout for recording HD movies. You can record images with a 4 : 3 , 3 : 2 or 16 : 9 aspect ratio. In each , you get the same angle of view and same outstanding image quality. The high - speed , high - performance Venus Engine HD The Venus Engine HD incorporates two CPUs.

The combination of these technologies reduces the blurring effect of both hand - shake and subject movement even further to provide the highest quality digital pictures yet , with sharp , clean and clear results no matter what the shooting conditions.Red - eye is the single biggest reason why the best portraits are ruined. The FinePix S2000HD uses Face Detection technology to find and instantly correct any red - eye from every face in the frame as the shot is taken. The system on the FinePix S2000HD will only correct redness in the pupil of the eye , not elsewhere in the picture , because the camera uses eye detection within face detection to find the pupil.

The "point and shoot" philosophy is brought to life by the camera's optical viewfinder , 1.5" LCD screen and easy - to - navigate menu bar , not to mention its streamlined design. Use with the optional Sony's Stamina InfoLithium batteries and you can snap happily for 120 minutes. Experiment with the Clip Motion animation and MPEG Movie modes to capture your audience before they become a distant memory. Compact and lightweight , DSC - P50 can easily be tucked into a shirt pocket or small purse.Specially designed for digital still photography , the Cyber - shot P50's CCD imaging system provides stunning detail and clarity with a resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels , with unprecedented and exceptional still image quality that is ideal for printing or Internet applications. The 1.5 - inch color LCD monitor provides bright , clear playback of captured images , and a quick refresh rate when used for image composition. The comprehensive information display reports available battery power ( in minutes when used with the InfoLithium pack ), remaining Memory Stick space , ISO setting , resolution setting , and shutter speed and aperture readings when the shutter button is halfway depressed. Most of the camera's exposure options are controlled through the LCD menu , as there are very few control buttons on the camera's exterior , minimizing the button clutter on the surface. The 3x , 6.4 - 19.2mm zoom lens has a maximum aperture of f / 3.8 , and a set of 37mm filter threads around the inside lip of the lens barrel to accommodate Sony's accessory lens kits , which extend the camera's macro and wide - angle capabilities. Focus is automatically controlled , though a handful of preset focus distances are available on the settings menu. DSC - P50 also offers non - stop recording for as long as your digital storage space lasts. By enabling up to 90 minutes of constant image recording , MPEG Movie EX makes a video camcorder out of your digital still camera. It features cue , play and rewind functions plus a mode allowing longer clips to be split into shorter segments. Clip Motion employs GIF animation to let you create an animated sequence from your images at the push of a button. Simply take up to 10 shots of your subject in the Clip Motion mode and the camera will create a color animation with a 0.5 - second playback interval. Small in size and Internet - ready , the animations are ideal for e - mail , web pages and a host of presentation uses. Creative enhancements let you instill different moods in your work : choose from Black and White , Sepia , Negative Art or Solarization effect for your photographs.

Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF - S lenses. Let's take a closer look at the Canon Rebel T5. 18.0 Megapixel CMOS ( APS - C ) Sensor The EOS Rebel T5 has an 18.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor , with ample resolution for big enlargements or crops. This first - class sensor is APS - C sized for an effective 1.6x field of view ( compared to 35mm format ) . Complementing the sensor is the DIGIC 4 Image Processor , which Canon says dramatically speeds up camera operations , pro viding images full of detail and natural color reproduction and good responsiveness. EOS Full HD Movie The EOS Rebel T5 offers easy - to - use video capture at up to 1080p ant 30fps and as Canon points out , Full HD quality shot by a larger - sensor camera such as the T5 is difficult for a smartphone to match. The T5 is capable of shoting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates , and operation is simple : press the dedicated Live View / Movie Recording button to get started shooting. Additionally , the EOS Rebel T5 enables easy manual control of exposure , focus and Live View features and even allows for in - camera editing. Video Snapshot feature lets you capture short video clips ( of 2 , 4 or 8 seconds ) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlight "album." With no editing needed after shooting , the compiled video is designed for online sharing or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Large 3.0 - inch LCD Monitor The EOS Rebel T5 has a huge , bright 3.0 - inch LCD monitor that is ideal for composing and capturing amazing images , as well as showing them off to friends and family. The large display has high resolution with 460 , 000 pixels and a wide viewing angle of 170°. Unlike the T5i , it does not flip out , is not a touchscreen , and is lower resolution than the million - plus pixel resolution of the T5i. These upgrades were sacrificed to keep the camera's price down , but if these features are important to you , you may want to consider the T5i instead of the T5. Scene Intelligent Auto mode Scene Intelligent Auto mode incorporates a number of Canon technologies. Combining data from Picture Style Auto , Automatic Lighting Optimizer , Automatic White Balance , Autofocus , and Automatic Exposure , Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image , accounting for faces , colors , brightness , moving objects , contrast , and whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod. It then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation. This is ideal for snapshooters making the jump from compacts or smart phones to interchangeable - lens cameras. Feature Guide To help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS Rebel T5 , the Feature Guide displays a simple description showing how it's applicable - or not - for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode , during mode dial operations , and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected - a helpful feature when a beginner is trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default , and can be disabled easily through the camera's menu. Up to 3.0 fps Continuous Shooting Burst rate is up to 3.0 fps ( frames per second ) for up to approximately 69 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAW files. That's about average for a beginner DSLR. Canon also claims instant startup , speedy AF and virtually no shutter lag. ISO 100 - 6400 ( Expandable to H : 12800 ) With a broad range of light sensitivity ratings from ISO 100 - 6400 ( expandable to H : 12800 ), the EOS Rebel T5 is is expected to do very well in low light without the need for flash. Thanks to this expanded ISO range , the EOS Rebel T5 can capture more subjects in more situations , handheld , without the need for flash. This means more natural and detailed looking pictures and movies that can be shot discreetly. 9 - point AF System and AI Servo AF The EOS Rebel T5's 9 - point AF system has a center cross - type AF point. The system intelligently uses both normal and high - precision focus , depending on the aperture and available light. Creative Scene Options Ideal for beginners looking to expand their photographic horizons is Creative Auto mode where basic settings are based on full automatic operation , but shooting guides on the LCD screen explain how to make changes to exposure , tone , sharpness and more , and how those changes will affect the final image. The camera features five creative filters for still images : Grainy B / W , Soft Focus , Fisheye Effect , Miniature Effect and Toy Camera Effect. Additionally , Basic+ makes it easy to create the image effects you want , changing ambience or scene type according to simple choices made on the camera's Quick Control Screen. Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF - S lenses The EOS Rebel T5 is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF - S lineup , ranging from ultra - wide angle to super telephoto lenses. A GPS Receiver GP - E2 , which attaches to the hot shoe or the digital terminal , lets you record location , including latitude , longitude and altitude , and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function. An electric compass records the camera's orientation during each shot , and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing. Features 18.0 Megapixel CMOS ( APS - C ) image sensor and high - performance DIGIC 4 Image Processor for excellent speed and quality. EOS Full HD Movie mode helps you capture brilliant results.

The Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH SD780 IS also has a 3x optical zoom that allows users to capture crisp , clear , and close - up images from longer distances. This compact digital camera features an optical image stabilizer , which helps to prevent the blurry images associated with unwanted camera shake.

This allows the user to take clearer images that require slower shutter speeds even in difficult shooting scenarios. A Smart AUTO scene detection feature on this Canon PowerShot 12.1 MP camera provides the user with a simple point and shoot option because it detects environmental situations and searches 18 possible modes to find the best setting for each picture. Product Features Exceptionally slender With its ultra - slim metallic form , the Digital IXUS 100 IS takes digital camera design to new heights of elegance. Its combination of supremely slender profile and high performance is achieved by a combination of Canon technologies , including two special glass - molded UA lenses. 12.1 megapixels A resolution of 12.1 megapixels captures every scene in rich amounts of detail.

Canon's in - lens optical Image Stabilizer works to deliver blur - free results throughout the zoom range. Scene Detection technology for effortless ease Smart Auto mode uses intelligent Scene Detection Technology to determine subject brightness , contrast , distance and overall hue.

High speed processing Canon’s DIGIC 4 processor drives exceptional processing speeds , responsive operation , superb image quality and color reproduction. Richly detailed , cleaner images , even at high ISO speeds , are the result of advanced noise reduction. Anti - blur The Digital IXUS 100 IS combats blur with Motion Detection Technology. Activated in Smart Auto mode , this uses a range of technologies to ascertain movement of both camera and subject. The optimum ISO is then automatically set for any situation. Face Detection technology A suite of Face Detection technologies detects faces in a shot and adjusts focus , exposure , flash settings and white balance - for optimal results with natural - looking skin tones. Blink Detection lets you avoid the disappointment of mistimed people shots. FaceSelf - Timer makes group photos and self - portraits easy , taking the shot when an extra face is detected in the frame.
