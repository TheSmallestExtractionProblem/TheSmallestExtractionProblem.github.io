A bright , large - aperture zoom lens , a big , extra - sensitive image sensor and other brilliant features are ready to fire up your passion to create. It's the new RX10 the compact digital camera that puts boundless picture - taking power in your hands and a fresh new outlook in your sights.   More Room to Zoom   Close - up shooting is seamless. No switching to macro mode is needed. Zoom in all the way up to extreme telephoto on a subject as near as 30cm away. The built - in lens makes it more convenient for you to take impressive shots throughout a big range.   Professional power. Portable size.   An advanced aspherical lens ( AA lens ) reduces diameter and length , and maintains high resolution even at image edges. A new Direct Drive SSM ( Super Sonic wave Motor ) stops lens movement with spot - on precision. Far - reaching optical flexibility minimizes mechanical dimensions. Precise alignment of the image sensor and lens also perfectly combines diminutive form and outsized performance.   A Clear Difference   Boasting a 20.2MP 1.0 - inch Exmor R   CMOS sensor with back - illuminated technology and approximately 4x larger light - sensitive area , RX10 harnesses light and reduces image noise in ways other compact DSC ( digital still cameras ) can't match. Combined with the high settings of a wide ISO range , even photos of dimly lit scenes look incredibly clear , crisp , and lifelike.   New BIONZ X Image Processing Engine   The groundbreaking new BIONZ   X image processing engine not only maximizes picture quality in ways that only a seamlessly unified body and lens design can realize it also faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time , as seen by the naked eye , with peerless high - speed processing. The experience of shooting and viewing stills and movies expands your senses by depicting true realism with richer tonal gradations and lower image noise than was previously possible. With such a high magnitude of power ready for every situation , BIONZ X naturally leads toward better ways to capture the world in full glory.   Quick Focusing Even at Telephoto Range   High - speed AF is remarkably smooth thanks to the Direct Drive SSM ( Super Sonic wave Motor ) with precision - engineered focusing stop positions designed to minimize focusing lens travel distance , which shortens focusing time.   Versatile Focus Area Selection   Choose among three concentric Flexible Spot frames for greater focusing versatility and precision than other cameras' fixed - focus spot frame systems can provide.   Lock - on Autofocus with Smart Precision   Just press the shutter button halfway to activate Lock - on AF. It precisely focuses even on moving subjects by continuously adjusting target frame size based on its recognition of subject characteristics. You can easily stay focused on the main action because this object tracking innovation optimizes autofocus timing. Even when a subject goes out of frame temporarily , tracking resumes at the moment that it is recaptured after re - entering the frame.   Eye Catching   Applying advanced detection technology , this new Eye AF function detects and focuses on a subject's eye , even if the subject is facing or looking slightly away from the camera. Then , a blinking green frame appears on that eye in the viewfinder image to indicate the point of focus for the upcoming shot.   Capture it all in Full HD   Record Full HD movies in the AVCHD Progressive , 1920 x 1080 format and select between supremely smooth - looking 60p or cinematically expressive 24p shooting modes. To maintain clear , steady movie shooting results , optical image stabilization in Active mode effectively reduces camera shake.   Professional - caliber Sound and Recording   The RX10 has plenty of features to realize more of the potential in your movies. To record sound with precision worthy of professional production , connect a high - performance microphone through an input terminal. Monitor pristine stereo sound through premium - quality Sony headphones plugged into the headphone jack. A built - in HDMI output terminal also accommodates connection of a TV , computer or DVD player / recorder. Audio metering and recording level control are instrumental to keeping soundtracks smooth and consistent. Use the camera's Multi Interface Shoe and an optional XLR Adaptor Kit to hook up external recording , flash and other accessories. It all adds up to a set of professional - class capabilities that is unprecedented among all other compact cameras.   See What You're Shooting   Connect via the HDMI terminal to transfer clear , uncompressed digital movie signal output from the RX10 to an external monitor / recorder simultaneously in real time. Or , for a cleaner view , turn off the shooting info display and watch your movies unfold on an external monitor / recorder.   A Truer Viewer   See spectacular clarity , contrast and detail in every scene , regardless of conditions , on the built - in , bright , high - resolution OLED Tru - Finder   . Four dual - sided aspherical lenses provide a big , approximately 33 - degree view angle and maintain excellent edge - to - edge visibility of the electronic viewfinder.   Customizing Convenient Command   For faster , more intuitive camera operation , you can customize a total of seven buttons by assigning up to 40 types of functions among them. As a result , you will gain more convenient access to your selection of frequently used functions , right at your fingertips.   A Spectrum of Settings   Use the manual ring to directly control certain settings , zooming and focusing , according to the focus mode in use. In addition , before turning the aperture ring to set F - stop , you can turn Aperture Click Switch on for a stepwise feel of assurance , or off for a quiet , smooth feel when setting the aperture. Display panels on top lets you glance at key settings without moving the camera as you look through the viewfinder.   Strong and Light Enough for Anything   Magnesium alloy top and front casings make RX10 light , solid and robust enough for long , rigorous use by advanced photographers and videographers. Shoot in rugged outdoor environments without worry as the dust - and moisture - resistant design gives you that added level of confidence to follow your subject wherever they may roam.   Advanced Easy Interface   A new , improved graphical user interface makes access to frequently used functions absolutely effortless. Just press the Fn button to display a list of them.   Cover Every Shooting Angle   Shoot comfortably from various positions via an approximately 1 , 229K - dot tiltable 3.0 - type White Magic   LCD screen. The display has the flexibility to be tilted within a range of angles extending from about 84 degrees upward to about 45 degrees downward.   Easily Connect with Smartphones and Tablets   Download the free PlayMemories Mobile   app and instantly connect via Wi - Fi   or NFC ( near field communication ) by touching a compatible Android   smartphone or tablet to the camera. Then , you can remotely control the camera's shutter release from that other mobile device , instantly receive the image on the device and upload transferred images to a social networking site.   Product Specifications   Limited Warranty   Software   Operating System Compatibility : Image Data Converter 4.0 : Microsoft Windows   Vista   SP2 , Windows   7 SP1 , Windows   8 ( Pentium 4 or faster ) Mac OS X ( 10.6 - 10.8 ) ( Intel Core Solo / Core Duo / Core 2 Duo or faster ) PlayMemories Home : Microsoft Windows   Vista   SP2 , Windows   7 SP1 , Windows   8 ( Pentium III 800 MHz or faster ; for playing / editing HD movies : Intel Core Duo 1.66 GHz or faster / Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz or faster , Intel Core 2 Duo 2.26 GHz or faster ( AVC HD ( FX / FH )) Mac OS X ( 10.6 - 10.8 ) ( Intel Core Solo / Core Duo / Core 2 Duo or faster ) Supplied Software : Supplied Software : PlayMemories Home , Image Data Converter Version 4 Advanced Features Image Stabilization : [ Still Image ] Optical [ Movie ] Active Mode , Optical type with electronic compensation ( Anti - rolling ) Auto High Dynamic Range : Yes , ( Auto Exposure Difference , Exposure difference Level ( 1 - 6 EV at 1.0 EV step ), off ) Sweep Panorama : Horizontal ( Wide / Standard ), Vertical ( Wide / Standard ) Face Detection : On , Off , Face Registration , Face Selection ; maximum eight faces detected Smile Shutter technology : Smile shutter ( selectable from 3 steps ) Priority Setting ( for Face Detection ) : Yes ( eight faces max ) Camera Camera Type : Cyber - shot   Digital Still Camera Lens Compatibility : Fixed lens Convenience Features Media / Battery Indicator : Yes View & Index : Single ( with or without shooting information ), RGB histogram and highlight / shadow warning , 4 / 9 - frame index view , Enlarged display mode ( L : 13.6x , M : 9.9x , S : 6.8x ), Auto Review ( 10 / 5 / 2 sec , Off ), Image orientation ( On / Off ), Slideshow , Panorama scrolling , Folder selection ( still ), Forward / Rewind ( movie ), Delete , Protect Still Image Playback Options : Single , 4 / 9 - frame index view , Enlarged display mode , Auto Review ( 10 / 5 / 2 sec , off ), Image orientation ( On / Off selectable ), Slideshow , Panorama scrolling , Folder selection , Delete , Protect Drive System Continuous Shooting Speed : Approx. 10 fps Shutter Speeds : Program Auto ( 1 - 1 / 3200 ) / Aperture Priority ( 8 - 1 / 3200 ) / Shutter Priority ( 30 - 1 / 3200 ) / Manual Exposure ( Bulb , 30 - 1 / 3200 ) / iAuto ( 4 - 1 / 3200 ) Self - timer : 10 sec. / 2 sec. / Self - portrait One - person / Self - portrait Two - person / Self timer Continuous ( 3 or 5 shots ) Drive Mode : Single - shot , Continuous , Speed Priority Continuous , Self - timer ( 10 / 2 sec. delay ), Self - timer ( Cont. ), Self - portrait One - person , Self - portrait Two - person , Bracketing Exposure System D - Range Optimizer : Off , Dynamic Range Optimizer ( Auto / Level ), Auto High Dynamic Range : Off , Auto exposure difference , Exposure difference level ( 1.0 6.0 EV , 1.0 EV step ) Auto Exposure Lock : Yes ( AE Lock button ) .

With 14 - bit A / D conversion ( 12 - bit selectable ) operating within the sensor , the D7000 realizes stunning images that are richer in tone and detail than previously possible in DX format without sacrificing shooting speed or energy efficiency. Combine these with the agility of the DX format and its signature 1.5x focal length telephoto potential and you can begin to see where this kind of shooting power can take you.   New image - processing engine "EXPEED 2" The D7000 employs the new image - processing engine "EXPEED 2". This achieves higher - performance noise reduction , improved color reproduction , high - speed image processing and enhanced movie - processing performance and efficient energy saving with a smaller engine chip than that of the D90. And there is no reduction in continuous shooting frame rate even when high ISO noise reduction or Active D - Lighting is activated.   Wide sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 6400 The ISO sensitivity range of the D7000 is wide , from ISO 100 to 6400 at normal setting , and it can be raised up to Hi 2 ( ISO 25600 equivalent ) . It delivers sharp images with minimized noise while maintaining resolution even at high ISO setting. The D7000 lets you select a faster shutter speed and expands creative possibilities in lowlight situations and sports scenes without worrying about image - degrading noise. ISO 100 ISO 400 ISO 1600 ISO 6400 Active D - Lighting with refined image processing Nikon's exclusive Active D - Lighting offers the ability to preserve details in the highlights and shadowy areas of images shot in high - contrast scenes such as those that are backlit. ADL levels are selectable from "Auto" , "Extra high" , "High" , "Normal" , "Low" and "Off". The D7000 employs a new image - processing system that produces less color phase shift even when the ADL level is increased.

Off Extra high Speed / Accuracy Scene Recognition System utilizing 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor and image sensor [ NEW ] Scene Recognition System precisely reads the situation of the subject before shooting and delivers highly accurate auto control. It utilizes a newly developed 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor to analyze brightness and color information of a scene and applies this to autofocus , auto exposure , i - TTL flash control and auto white balance for accurate control. Also , the D7000 detects up to 35 human faces utilizing image sensor when using face - priority AF during Live View and movie recording , and playback zoom of people's faces of still images. AF system featuring 39 high - density focus points [ NEW ] The D7000 incorporates Multi - CAM 4800DX autofocus sensor module. It detects and tracks the subject precisely with 39 focus points. Nine cross - type sensors cover the most frequently used center area to deliver higher subject - acquisition and focusing performance. There are selectable AF area modes according to the scene - single - point AF , dynamic - area AF ( 9 points , 21 points and 39 points ), 3D - tracking and auto - area AF. You can also choose to shoot with 11 focus points. With Scene Recognition System that recognizes more detailed information utilizing finer - segment 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor , the D7000 shows higher subject - tracking and subject - identification performance.   Dynamic - area AF mode : 39 points Selectable AF - area modes - Single - point AF mode Ideal for stationary subjects. Camera focuses on the subject at a selected focus point only.   Single - point AF mode - Dynamic - area AF mode Suitable for capturing moving subjects. If the subject briefly leaves the selected focus point , the camera will focus based on information from surrounding points. 9 points : Suitable for when there is time to compose the photograph or for subjects that are moving predictably 21 points : Suitable for a randomly and unpredictably moving subject 39 points : Suitable for a fast - moving and predictably moving subject   Dynamic - area AF mode : 21 points - 3D - tracking mode Pursues your subject using all 39 focus points. Once focusing is achieved with a selected focus point , the focus point automatically changes to track the subject according to its movement while the shutter - release button is pressed halfway.     3D - tracking mode - Auto - area AF mode The D7000 detects the main subject using all 39 focus points and automatically focuses on it. With a G - or D - type AF NIKKOR lens , the D7000 can distinguish foreground and background using "subject identification" of Scene Recognition System and detects a person's position by recognizing human skin tone for improved subject acquisition.   Auto - area AF mode Note : Only the selected focus point is shown on actual images. Also , if you select focus points in a peripheral area of an image when [ 9 points ] or [ 21 points ] is chosen , the number of focus points actually used may be less than 9 or 21. Auto exposure control The 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor detects highlights within a frame precisely. It calculates optimal exposure to deliver more accurate auto exposure control and i - TTL flash control.   Auto white balance The D7000's intelligent auto white balance algorithm renders white as truly white even when shot under a wide range of light sources , including mercury vapor light. The D7000 analyzes color and brightness information of the scene before shooting utilizing Scene Recognition System , and detects the light source highly accurately by referencing its massive collection of in - camera shooting data. The D7000 also carries another auto white balance mode that maintains warm lighting ambience when you shoot under incandescent light.   Normal     Keep warm lighting colors Viewfinder employing glass pentaprism with approx. 100% frame coverage and approx. 0.94x* high - magnification With approximately 100% frame coverage in the viewfinder , you see what the D7000's image sensor sees.

The Canon HS SYSTEM boosts low - light performance with the new Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor and a high - sensitivity 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. This advanced Canon technology delivers stunning image quality with reduced noise and blur. Colors are more vibrant and white balance is true - to - life. The 35x Optical Zoom offers incredible reach and range , allowing you to shoot any scene , near or far. The Optical Image Stabilizer helps images come out steady and clear , and a 24mm ultra Wide - Angle lens makes it easy to take pictures of large groups of people , tall buildings , expansive landscapes and much more. The camera also features a 2.7 - inch Vari - angle LCD for great shooting flexibility. Packed with an array of powerful technologies , the PowerShot SX40 HS is a convenient digital camera capable of brilliant image capture.     Features   Canon's high powered 35x Wide - Angle Optical Zoom ( 24 - 840mm ) with Optical Image Stabilizer delivers magnificent images whether you are up close or far away.   Extreme Zoom for Infinite Possibilities.   35x Wide - Angle Optical Zoom and 24mm Lens   The PowerShot SX40 HS is equipped with a Genuine Canon 35x Zoom lens that provides the telephoto power to bring your distant subjects incredibly close. It also features a useful zoom range that begins at 24mm wide - angle and extends to 840mm telephoto ( 35mm equivalent ) . The 24mm ultra Wide - Angle allows you to create shots with dramatic perspective and makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes , large groups of people and tall buildings. This superb lens delivers outstanding optical performance throughout its zoom range. It's advanced design employs UD glass , double - sided aspherical glass - molded and ultra - high - refraction - index glass lens elements to effectively suppress chromatic aberration while maintaining a remarkably compact size. The camera uses a VCM ( Voice Coil Motor ) for high - speed , quiet , energy - efficient lens movement with precise control.     Optical Image Stabilizer   Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake , making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens - shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical , providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations : outdoors at dusk , inside without a flash , and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos , it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds , accommodating more low - light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced , you get a sharper , steadier image. And because it is an optical system , there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.     12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor combined with the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor creates the Canon HS SYSTEM for improved low - light performance up to ISO 3200 and enhanced image quality.   Experience the Power. Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor   The latest - generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i - Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural - looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new , highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source , the new Canon Multi - Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed , for example , for the main subject and the background.     Canon HS SYSTEM   The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright , clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low - light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras : a high - sensitivity imaging sensor , which is able to capture more light ; and the DIGIC Image Processor , which actively reduces noise with high - speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX40 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction , expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.   Capture stunning Full HD 1080p video in stereo sound with a dedicated movie button ; zoom while shooting and play back videos on an HDTV via the HDMI output.   Memorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD.   Canon Full HD Video Advantage   In addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM , the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot SX40 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp , clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. The PowerShot SX40 HS shoots Full HD video at 24* frames per second , ensuring clear lifelike motion images with a beautiful cinematic quality. It also shoots beautifully detailed 720p HD video at 30 fps.**     *Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps. **Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.   Dedicated Movie Button , Wind Filter and Optical Zoom While Shooting   It's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX40 HS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot SX40 HS also incorporates an electronic wind filter , which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point - and - shoot cameras , the PowerShot SX40 HS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video.     HDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support   It's easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot SX40 HS. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot SX40 HS supports HDMI - CEC technology , you'll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC - enabled HDTV using the TV's remote control. ( CEC - Consumer Electronic Control - is part of the HDMI specification , enabling components in a system to communicate with one another. )         iFrame Movie Support   With the PowerShot SX40 HS , you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format , which is a computer - friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small , making it more convenient to upload or e - mail high - quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications , making it unnecessary to perform time - consuming and often quality - degrading conversions.     Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition.   A Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image. Intelligent IS   The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology , Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills , the system automatically selects among Normal , Panning , Macro ( Hybrid ) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video , the system automatically selects among Dynamic , Powered , Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS , you can concentrate on image capture , letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.     Normal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid Corrects for shift - type camera shake , which typically occurs in macro ( close - up ) shooting.   Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide - angle focal lengths , eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range , where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected , the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.   High - Speed Burst HQ allows for continuous capture at a maximum of 8 frames* while maintaining superb image quality and Super Slow Motion Movie records video at high speeds to allow playback in slow motion.   Versatile Still and Video Shooting Options.   High - Speed Burst HQ   Utilizing the increased processing speed and power of the new Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor , High - Speed Burst HQ makes it possible to capture fast action stills at full resolution during continuous shooting.

When you use Movie Digest on the PowerShot SX40 HS , the camera will automatically record a short video clip ( up to approximately 4 seconds ) every time you shoot a still image. That entire day's worth of clips will then be automatically combined into a single video. Movie Digest does all the work , so you can sit back and enjoy your video!   How does this work? When you activate Movie Digest , the camera continuously records a "loop" of video up to 4 seconds long into an area of the memory card reserved for this feature. Every time you take a still photo , the video clip residing in memory at that time is appended to a file that will eventually become the day's highlights video. The following day , the camera will start a new video file. Movie Digest does not affect regular video shooting , so you can use it and still switch between still and video capture as desired.   Although the beauty of Movie Digest is the ease with which you can create a video of the day , you can , if you wish , edit the created videos on your computer. Version 6.8 or later of the included ZoomBrowser EX ( for Windows ) and ImageBrowser ( for Mac OS ) software lets you freely select and delete unwanted scenes from your Movie Digest videos.   Miniature Effect for Movies & Stills   Emphasizes perspective for a miniature effect by blurring upper and bottom portions of videos and stills.   Super Slow Motion Movie   Record your clips in high speed ( approx. 240 fps ), and then watch your videos in slow motion.   2.7 - inch wide Vari - Angle LCD enables easy viewing from any angle.   Get the Shot from Any Angle.   2.7 - inch Vari - Angle LCD   The PowerShot SX40 HS features a convenient and highly useful 2.7 - inch Vari - Angle LCD screen that swivels out almost a full 180 degrees. It also rotates through approximately 270 degrees , letting you tilt it up or down to shoot at low or high angles. You can compose freely even when shooting from difficult vantage points and use the full range of angle adjustment even when the camera is mounted on a tripod. You can even rotate the LCD facing forward to capture perfectly framed self - portraits and to join group shots. The PureColor System LCD screen has 230 , 000 dots , giving you a crisp , clear picture to make shooting , playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient.       Zoom Framing Assist button aids in tracking and capturing subjects during super telephoto photography.   Zoom In and Capture the Perfect Moment.   Zoom Framing Assist   With its 35x Optical Zoom lens , the PowerShot SX40 HS has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away. At maximum telephoto , however , it can be very difficult to track a moving subject while trying to steady the camera. Zoom Framing Assist is an inventive feature that makes it much easier to use the camera?s powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist function button , the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view , enabling you to more easily locate your moving target on the LCD screen or through the electronic viewfinder. Once you find it , releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original telephoto position , intelligently keeping the subject in focus so that you?re ready to shoot and capture the perfect close - up moment.     Improved Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on 32 predefined shooting situations.   A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos.

Easy Shooting.   It's time to give yourself the power to zoom - really zoom - quickly and easily. The advanced yet simple - to - use PowerShot SX400 IS gets you up close from virtually anywhere with a 30x Optical Zoom and 24mm Wide - Angle lens with Optical Image Stabilizer for beautiful clarity. Give your images and video what they've been missing : zoom in on your child's face in a crowd , capture action from up in the stands , or a pet's most playful moments. In addition to this impressive versatility , PowerShot SX400 IS offers incredible Canon image quality , with a 16.0 Megapixel* sensor and the Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor for richly detailed , brilliant images and true - to - life 720p HD video. The camera makes it easy to get your best shot every time , with Intelligent IS for shake - free images , High Speed AF for effortless shooting , and Smart AUTO that automatically chooses the proper camera settings for the shooting situation. Smart , easy , incredibly versatile : PowerShot SX400 IS gives you it all.   Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.     Features   Canon's powerful 30x Optical Zoom ( 24 - 720mm ) and 24mm Wide - Angle lens with Optical Image Stabilizer help ensure outstanding optical performance and versatility.   Extend Your Reach 30x Optical Zoom and 24mm Wide - Angle Lens   Once you start shooting with PowerShot SX400 IS , you'll quickly wonder how you ever did without the versatility of its powerful zoom lens. The 30x Optical Zoom lens has a reach all the way from 24mm to 720mm , so if you're capturing a child on stage from the back of the auditorium , you'll see his / her every expression. The Wide - Angle lens just as easily delivers superb landscapes and large group portraits. Canon's decades of leadership in optical technology give every shot the brilliance and clarity it deserves. The Optical Image Stabilizer helps ensure you get clear , noise - free images , even at the long end of the zoom.       16.0 Megapixel sensor and Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor deliver stunning quality images.   Powerful Core Specs Deliver Beautiful Images   16.0 Megapixel* Image Sensor   The PowerShot SX400 IS camera's 16.0 Megapixel* CCD sensor delivers impressive photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution ensures superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.   Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels. DIGIC 4+ Image Processor   The Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX400 IS camera's advanced functions and capabilities. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast , responsive performance , for a shooting experience that's easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality : processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by approximately 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color , smooth gradations , and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor's highly efficient design also extends battery life.     Capture impressive 720p HD video with a dedicated movie button and zoom while shooting.   Preserve and Share Your Memories in HD   Canon HD Video Advantage   The PowerShot SX400 IS camera lets you record highly detailed 720p HD video at 25 frames per second with clear sound. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot high definition video whenever you want , right from your compact digital camera.     Dedicated movie button , Wind Filter feature and Optical Zoom while shooting   It's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX400 IS camera has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The camera also incorporates an electronic wind filter , which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. The PowerShot SX400 IS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video without sacrificing HD video resolution.     Intelligent IS automatically chooses from eight different modes to optimize image stabilization for virtually shake - free images in a wide variety of conditions.   A Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image   Intelligent IS   The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology , Intelligent IS , analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills , the system automatically selects among Normal , Panning , Macro ( Hybrid ) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video , the system automatically selects among Dynamic , Powered , Macro and Active Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS , you can concentrate on image capture , letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to help capture the steadiest possible image.       Still Image Shooting   Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.   Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.       Macro ( Hybrid ) IS Corrects for shift - type camera shake , which typically occurs in macro ( close - up ) shooting.   Tripod When tripod use is detected , the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.       Video Recording   Dynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide - angle focal lengths , eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.   Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range , where camera shake is magnified.       Macro ( Hybrid ) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift - type camera shake common in macro shooting.   Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod , the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.   High Speed AF greatly helps improve focus speed so you can capture every shot with ease.   Faster Focus Helps You Capture Every Shot   High Speed AF   The PowerShot SX400 IS camera is equipped with Canon's latest advancements in autofocus ( AF ) technology. Working on multiple fronts , Canon has developed AF that is significantly faster than on previous models , for a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. The extremely responsive High Speed AF lets you capture great shots as they happen , with reduced lag time. Several engineering breakthroughs contributed to this major enhancement to speed. In addition to improved AF algorithms , the camera can process multiple sequences simultaneously , and takes advantage of reworked controls between AF and the start of shooting.     Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on predefined shooting situations** to help ensure the best possible image capture for stills or video.   A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos   Smart AUTO   Smart AUTO is a sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. It automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture , whether you're shooting stills or video. With Smart AUTO , all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.     Additional Features   Secure Enhanced Grip   Canon developed an innovative new grip for the PowerShot SX400 IS , optimized specifically for the camera's powerful zooming capability. The invitingly curved grip fits effortlessly into your hand. Without any strain , your fingers comfortably and naturally reach the shutter , minimizing the potential for shake at long zoom lengths.     Shooting Modes PowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take impressive photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.   Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.   Live View Control Enables Brightness , Color , and Tone adjustments to your images using easy - to - understand controls.   Smart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point - and - shoot simplicity.   Portrait The camera sets a large aperture , focusing on the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject pop.   Face Self - timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter.   Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.   Creative Filters This setting provides easy access to special filter effects and scene modes , such as Toy Camera Effect , Poster Effect , Monochrome and more.   Fisheye Effect Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens.   Miniature Effect for Movies & Stills Emphasizes perspectives for a miniature effect by blurring upper and lower portions of the image.   Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with toy or pinhole cameras , darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.   Monochrome Choose from three single - tone effects : Black - and - White , Sepia , or Blue.   Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues , saturating the scene with bright colors.   Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color , turning subtle gradations into eye - catching , scene - popping contrasts.   Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.   Fireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.   Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect , ideal for urban night photography.   Movie Record video in monaural sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.   Specifications Type Compact digital still camera with built - in flash , 30x Optical , 4x Digital and 120x Combined Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer Image Capture Device Type 16.0 Megapixel , 1 / 2.3 - inch CCD Total Pixels Approx. 16.6 Megapixels Effective Pixels Approx. 16.0 Megapixels* *Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.

[ NEW ] Full - time - servo AF ( AF - F ) Autofocus automatically begins after Live View is activated , tracking the subject continuously without having to press the shutter - release button. Note : When shooting movies , noise from the lens motor may be recorded. Single - servo AF ( AF - S ) Great for stationary subjects. Focus locks when the shutter - release button is pressed halfway. Manual focus ( MF ) Focus manually. AF - area modes for live view and movies - Four modes to capture subject When using Live View or shooting movies , choose from four AF - area modes depending on the subject : normal - area AF , wide - area AF , face - priority AF , and subject - tracking AF. Normal - area AF Offers pinpoint precision when focusing on a small area - ideal when using a tripod. Wide - area AF A good all - round choice for a variety of subjects , both moving and stationary. It is especially well - suited for handheld shooting. Face - priority AF The camera can recognize up to 35 faces at a time then focus on the face that is determined to be nearest. Even if people in the frame move , the camera continues tracking and focusing. [ NEW ] Subject - tracking AF   D3100 memorizes' a subject then automatically tracks it even if it moves. Should the subject momentarily leave the frame , the camera starts tracking again once it re - enters. By using this with AF - F ( full - time - servo AF ) you can also maintain focus on the subject while tracking. This is a great way to photograph active children and pets. Note : Autofocus operation is interrupted while the camera is tracking the subject.   Automatic 11 - point AF system - Quick , accurate autofocus ready for the decisive moment D3100's precision high - speed autofocus responds immediately to changes in scene or composition , maintaining tack - sharp focus to capture fleeting expressions and fast - moving sports. The all - important central focus point features a cross - type sensor while the new superimposed display achieves a clear , uncluttered viewfinder. Various autofocus modes cover nearly any situation , including auto - area AF that automatically selects the subject on which to focus , and 3D - tracking ( 11 points ) * that maintains focus on a subject regardless of changes in composition as long as the shutter - release button is pressed halfway. * When autofocus is set to AF - A or AF - C. 11 AF points Note : The 11 AF points shown here are for illustration purposes only. Actual appearance differs. Single - point AF Manually select an autofocus point with the multi - selector , compose , and shoot. This is a great way to maintain focus on static , off - center subjects. Dynamic - area AF Capturing fast moving subjects has never been easier. Select a focus area and the corresponding autofocus points combine to produce sharp results. Auto - area AF Unsure of what mode to use? Let the D3100 decide for you. It automatically changes autofocus modes depending on whether the subject is static or dynamic. 3D - tracking ( 11 points ) Select an autofocus point on a moving subject and the D3100 locks on , utilizing all autofocus points to keep the subject in sharp focus even as the composition changes. Advanced white balance control - More natural whites The Improved Scene Recognition system offers outstanding auto white balance performance that nearly rivals the precision of the D3s , Nikon's flagship camera. White is reproduced more faithfully while maintaining stable color balance regardless of light source. Built - in pop - up flash - Additional light whenever needed When the light gets low or you find yourself shooting in tricky backlit lighting , use the built - in pop - up flash to brighten the scene. It activates automatically when needed depending on exposure mode* , or can be enabled manually. In addition , support for i - TTL flash control increases exposure accuracy. * When Scene Mode is set to Auto , Portrait , Child , Close - up or Night portrait     Convenient and powerful Speedlight SB - 400 ( sold separately ) Bouncing flash off ceilings or walls is easy with optional Speedlight SB - 400. Supplementing D3100's built - in flash , SB - 400 gives you the means to produce photos with softer , more natural - looking lighting.   Shooting with direct flash Shooting with bounce flash Scene Recognition System - Intelligent operation in any setting Nikon's exclusive Scene Recognition System utilizes a 420 - pixel RGB sensor to analyze a composition immediately before you take the shot.

With Intelligent IS , you can concentrate on image capture , letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to help capture the steadiest possible image.       Still Image Shooting   Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.   Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.       Macro ( Hybrid ) IS Corrects for shift - type camera shake , which typically occurs in macro ( close - up ) shooting.   Tripod When tripod use is detected , the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.       Video Recording   Dynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide - angle focal lengths , eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.   Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range , where camera shake is magnified.       Macro ( Hybrid ) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift - type camera shake common in macro shooting.   Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod , the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.   Faster Focus Helps You Capture Every Shot High Speed AF The PowerShot SX400 IS camera is equipped with Canon's latest advancements in autofocus ( AF ) technology. Working on multiple fronts , Canon has developed AF that is significantly faster than on previous models , for a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. The extremely responsive High Speed AF lets you capture great shots as they happen , with reduced lag time. Several engineering breakthroughs contributed to this major enhancement to speed. In addition to improved AF algorithms , the camera can process multiple sequences simultaneously , and takes advantage of reworked controls between AF and the start of shooting.   A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos Smart AUTO Smart AUTO is a sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. It automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture , whether you're shooting stills or video. With Smart AUTO , all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.   Additional Features Secure Enhanced Grip Canon developed an innovative new grip for the PowerShot SX400 IS , optimized specifically for the camera's powerful zooming capability. The invitingly curved grip fits effortlessly into your hand.

The PowerShot G1 X digital camera will inspire advanced amateurs who have embraced the G - Series to explore new realms of photographic expression , and give pros an excellent camera that complements their creative demands. The new 1.5 - inch High - Sensitivity CMOS sensor approaches an EOS DSLR's APS - C sized sensor , with a light - sensitive area that's approximately 6.3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera. The new 14.3 Megapixel sensor , combined with a new lens and DIGIC 5 Image Processor , creates the HS SYSTEM that delivers image quality previously impossible in a compact camera , with beautiful blur , lower noise , and extraordinary resolution in low - light shooting and can shoot at ISOs of up to 12800. The PowerShot G1 X also has 14 - bit RAW capabilities for even greater creative control and Full HD Video recording. Manual settings and operability inherited from EOS cameras impart a high - level shooting experience , and open the door to new creative possibilities. Substantive luxury defines the design : a neatly clarified sculpture with a firm grip , huge Vari - angle LCD and optical viewfinder.     Features   A newly developed Canon 1.5 - inch , 14.3 Megapixel High - Sensitivity CMOS sensor combined with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor creates Canon's HS SYSTEM for outstanding low - light performance up to ISO 12800. Full range of shooting and recording modes including 14 - bit RAW + JPEG , as found in Canon DSLR cameras for the ultimate creative control. Shoot beautiful 1080p Full HD video in stereo sound with a dedicated movie button ; zoom while shooting and play back videos on an HDTV via the HDMI output. 4x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer , plus a 28mm Wide - Angle Lens delivers exceptional image quality and allows you to capture more in your frame. Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition. Bright 3.0 - inch Vari - Angle PureColor System LCD with 922 , 000 dots for shooting at a variety of angles plus an optical viewfinder. High - Speed Burst HQ allows for continuous capture at a maximum of 6 frames* while maintaining superb image. Compatible with Canon Speedlite flashes for additional creative lighting options. Mode Dial and Front Dial provide intuitive manual adjustment. High Dynamic Range scene mode combines multiple shots into one picture showing greater image detail.   Image Quality Never Before Seen in a Compact Camera.   Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor   The latest - generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i - Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural - looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new , highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source , the new Canon Multi - Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed , for example , for the main subject and the background.     Canon 1.5 - inch , 14.3 Megapixel High - Sensitivity CMOS Sensor Canon engineers developed a sensor for PowerShot G1 X digital camera that is nearly the size of an EOS DSLR camera's APS - C sized sensor , and built with a similar pixel structure - each pixel site is larger , allowing more light to be captured - giving the PowerShot G1 X a completely different level of image quality than compact cameras that have come before it. At 1.5 inches , the sensor is approximately 6.3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera. This heightened degree of sensitivity , along with 14.3 Megapixels , delivers several distinct advantages. Noise is dramatically reduced at high ISO speeds for clear low - light and nighttime shooting. Resolution at low ISO speeds is incredibly rich and precise. And , most atypically for a compact camera , the PowerShot G1 X digital camera allows you to create the intensely beautiful background blur that is the hallmark of DSLR cameras.       APS - C sensor used in Canon EOS DSLR cameras   Canon HS SYSTEM   The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright , clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low - light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras : a high - sensitivity imaging sensor , which is able to capture more light ; and the DIGIC Image Processor , which actively reduces noise with high - speed image processing. The 14.3 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot G1 X incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction , expanding the usable range to an amazingly high ISO 12800. The HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.     Specifications   Type Compact digital still camera with built - in flash , 4x Optical , 4x Digital , and 16x Combined Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer   Image Capture Device   Type 14.3 Megapixels , 1.5 - inch CMOS   Total Pixels Approx. 15.0 Megapixels   Effective Pixels Approx. 14.3 Megapixels   Lens   Focal Length 15.1 ( W ) - 60.4mm ( T ) ( 35mm film equivalent : 28 ( W ) - 112mm ( T )   Digital Zoom 4x   Focusing Range Normal : 1.3 ft.

The camera offers an effective pixel count of 16.2 - million pixels and enables capture of high - definition images exhibiting superior image quality with extremely detailed rendering and rich tones with smooth gradations. With standard sensitivity range of ISO100 - 6400 and additional increases of up to Hi 2 ( ISO 25600 equivalent ), the camera offers improved capability in shooting under dim lighting in the evening or indoors , and also expands possibilities for expression with rapidly moving subjects. EXPEED 2 is Nikon's latest image - processing engine developed using the ideas , expertise and technologies in digital imaging that Nikon has cultivated over the years. EXPEED 2 enables faster image processing , a high level of noise reduction , better color reproduction characteristics , and reduced power consumption. A compact , elegant body that offers both authenticity and flexibility A magnesium alloy has been adopted for the top and rear covers for increased durability in a size equivalent to that of the D90. All joints on the camera body have also been sealed to ensure a greater level of water and dust resistance. A new 2 , 016 - pixel RGB metering sensor With 2 , 016 pixels , the new metering sensor developed for the D7000 offers twice the metering pixels as our previous high - end metering sensor. Prior to shooting , the 2 , 016 - pixel RGB sensor acquires accurate information regarding the scene. That information is then reflected in auto - focusing , automatic exposure , i - TTL balanced fill - flash , and auto white balance control for extremely faithful images. A new 39 - point AF system An AF sensor module with 39 effective focus points Adoption of the new Multi - CAM4800DX autofocus sensor module enables certain acquisition and tracking of the intended subject with 39 focus points. Nine cross - type sensors at the most frequently used center of the frame allow for certain acquisition of the intended subject. In addition , the number of active focus points can also be limited to 11. Superior subject acquisition and tracking performance Depending upon the scene or subject , the AF - area mode can be selected from Single - point AF , Dynamic - area AF , 3D - tracking and Auto - area AF. Wide focus areas containing a large number of focus points work together to accurately acquire and track the subject. D - Movie for recording and editing of full HD movies The D7000 is equipped with the D - Movie function that enables recording of high - definition movies ( 1920 1080p , 24 fps ) exhibiting superior video quality. Autofocusing during movie recording is possible using contrast - detect AF. When the focus mode is set to Full time - servo AF ( AF - F ) and the AF - area mode to Subject - tracking AF , the camera automatically maintains focus on a subject moving throughout the frame in three dimensions. The D7000 also offers in - camera movie editing functions that allow users to save a single frame as a still JPEG image or delete unnecessary portions from the beginning or end of movie files. Recording of stereo sound via an external microphone is also supported. Other functions and features new to the D7000 A glass pentaprism for viewfinder frame coverage of approximately 100% and magnification of approximately 0.94 High - speed continuous shooting of up to 100 shots at approximately 6 fps , and a very precise and durable shutter unit that has passed testing for 150 , 000 cycles New U1 and U2 settings on the mode dial allow users to assign frequently used settings including ISO sensitivity and exposure compensation , for instant recall , by simply rotating the mode dial Live view function that can be smoothly enabled with the dedicated live view switch Double SD memory card slot that enable use of two SD memory cards ( SDHC , SDXC also supported ) The Rechargeable Li - ion Battery EN - EL15 , which enables capture of around 1 , 050 shots when fully charged Support for the new Multi - Power Battery Pack MB - D11 ( sold separately ), which holds not only Rechargeable Li - ion Batteries EN - EL15 , but also AA batteries Nikon's image browsing and editing software , ViewNX 2 , supplied with purchase.   Specifications   Type of Camera Single - lens reflex digital camera Effective Pixels 16.2 million Image Sensor Nikon DX format ( 23.6 x 15.6 mm ) CMOS sensor Image Size ( Pixels ) 4 , 928 x 3 , 264 [ L ], 3 , 696 2 , 448 [ M ], 2 , 464 1 , 632 [ S ];
